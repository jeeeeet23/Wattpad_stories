["It had been a long and mentally trying day for Xavier, but the end was in sight. So far it had been nothing but the normal medical tests and his overprotective aunt trying to do everything for him. Same old, same old. The hum of his massive motorized wheelchair and the squeak of his aunt's shoes on polished floor lulled him into a strange state of detachment. He had been down this hall so many times that it had become rote.Lurking behind his aunt were six silent bodyguards. Xavier suspected they wouldn't make any noise if they tap-danced across broken glass. Ever present, silent watchers whose eyes never stopped evaluating everything around them for threats.He had lived with his aunt since he could remember. After all these years the permanent, unsmiling, besuited bodyguards had become a familiar part of the background. So much so that Xavier almost didn't notice when the guards opened the doors in front of him, checking for threats before they entered.It wasn't like he couldn't open the doors and walk through the hospital by himself. Well, he could, but the tendency for his skin to split open when he moved without his wheelchair and the tremendous pressure his bulk put on his bones kept him sitting still.Thankfully, there was some light at the end of the tunnel. After years of theories on what was wrong with him, the doctors thought that they had finally figured out a fix for his condition. As the elevator headed down to one of the basement floors for his final checks, Xavier couldn't help but be hopeful.A chime announced the arrival at their floor, and the soft hiss of the doors snapped Xavier out of his reverie. The long, neutral colored hall stretched out into the distance. Pale pastels, intended to be soothing, presented the promise of tedium and wasted time. The bland hall was currently full as a man in a delivery uniform struggled to push a massive crate down the corridor.At a touch from his aunt, Xavier's massive wheelchair hummed out of the elevator and down the hall, the large wheels squeaking against the hospital tile. Xavier looked up at the 8-foot ceiling, thankful that he was sitting. At least sitting down he did not have to duck. Silver linings, right?A nurse coming toward the elevator squeezed past the delivery man with a wheeled bed. Appreciating the soft curve of her backside, the delivery man leaned out for a second look as she passed him. Blocked by the large crate that was in his way, he leaned out to the side, causing his precariously balanced load to shift forward! Twisting to the side, the box began to topple toward the bed.The nurse heard the scrape of the box as it shifted and only had time for a gasp before it came crashing down. In a desperate attempt to shield her patient, she threw herself across the bed and closed her eyes, bracing herself for the pain she knew was coming.Yet the impending crash never came, and a couple seconds later she opened her eyes in confusion, looking up. And up. And up. Met with the sight of the largest person she had ever seen casually holding the massive crate, she stared in open-eyed amazement at the giant who had saved her.Dark hair cropped short above a massive face with a rugged brow and a strong jaw gave the intimation of attractiveness, yet the ideal was ruined by the skin that stretched across his cheekbones, pulling back on the corners of his eyes, nose, and mouth, creating a grotesque caricature of superman. Just bigger. Much, much bigger.The giant smiled at her and she smiled back, lost in the surreal situation until rapid red splashes snapped her out of it.\"Oh, you're bleeding!\" she mumbled, still half in shock as she watched blood rain down from the giant hand that gripped the edge of the box to join a pool of blood that was beginning to form around his feet.\"Well, would you look at that?\" responded Xavier, his deep bass voice echoing through the corridor as the bodyguards swarmed forward.Twenty minutes later, Xavier sat next to his aunt while a nurse finished taking care of his wound.\"Always the hero,\" Julia teased, poking at his broad shoulder. \"You should have left it up to the guards rather than hurting yourself.\"\"You've taught me better than that,\" Xavier said with a slight smile.Soon the doctor arrived and sat down next to Julia, handing her a large stack of papers. Xavier stayed in his wheelchair to avoid towering over the other two or breaking a chair. His hand had been bandaged to prevent additional blood loss, and a nurse had finished taking a blood sample to run some more tests. Holding his bandaged hand to keep the bleeding from starting again, Xavier looked at the doctor with some interest. Rather than the normal boring tests, it seemed from the doctor's expression that something new was going to happen, and whatever it was, it would be a welcome break from the monotony of his normal routine.Ever since he was little and his condition was discovered, Xavier had been stuck in the same routine. Sitting, studying, slow Taijiquan exercises, and doctor's tests. The school and Taijiquan practice were not so bad, but after so many years the sitting and doctor's exams were starting to wear on him. There was very little excitement in his life, a fact that made him hyper-aware of any changes. Speaking of changes, his aunt had been trying to hide something from him, a birthday present most likely, and Xavier wondered if the visit today had something to do with it.For a moment, his thoughts went back to what had happened, and he wondered about the identity of the girl who had been lying on the bed. She was quite attractive and young-looking, though he had a lot of trouble guessing people's ages, as everyone looked rather childish from his perspective. It went without saying that the world looked quite different from his height.As they had progressed down the hall, he had noticed the slight shift in the massive crate and knew it would fall. He had been able to speed up his chair to get close and his arms were long enough to catch the crate as it tipped. The simple motion of catching the crate had put a deep cut into his palm, as his thin skin was stretched so tight it was unable to bear the pressure. The resulting cut brought pain and blood, but at least the others were safe. The pain was nothing to sneeze at, but a lifetime of such injuries had made Xavier all but immune to the feeling.The doctor looked at Xavier and his aunt, Julia Lee, pushing his glasses back on his nose. As Xavier's only surviving relative, Julia still had custody of Xavier until he turned 18 in two years, though no one looking at Xavier's 8' 9\" frame would ever imagine he was only 16 years old.After many years of testing and treatment that yielded no results, a fringe researcher had come up with an idea to help, and through cooperation with the Horizon facility, the doctor was here to suggest it.Going over the information again with Julia and Xavier, the doctor explained, \"Even though we've talked through this exhaustively, Ms. Lee, I still have to take Xavier through the process for the sake of both our legal rights.\"\"Xavier,\" the doctor turned to look at the giant boy. \"If you choose to proceed, you will be undergoing a new type of nanodermatology treatment that is being referred to as CNB, Cutaneous Nanite Bonding. It is a new treatment that has been pioneered by a medical research facility in Switzerland. While it has not been cleared for general use, you have been approved to receive the treatment because it was actually developed using your body as a model. We've been aware of this treatment for a couple years but have been hesitant to suggest it because of your accelerated growth rate. Your tests over the last year have shown a significant decrease in growth so it became an option.\"As you know, your cells are more robust than the average person's which is why we are so confident that the treatment will work. In layman's terms, the treatment will use nanites to restructure the way your cells bond across your body, increasing the strength and elasticity of your skin to the point where it will not tear, strengthening your bones so they can bear your weight, reducing the stress of gravity on your muscles.\"At the end of this process, we expect four things. First, your body is going to increase in density. Much more so than the average person's. This will be due to the way the nanites are restructuring you. Second, your body will be able to support its weight without issue, despite the fact that your weight will be increasing due to the density gain. That means walking, running, all those activities that are not possible for you unassisted, will be possible.\"Third, your skin will loosen, as the nanites will be increasing the surface area of your skin. This should take care of the stretching issue you have without the need for plastic surgery. It will clear up all your stretch marks as well. Last, we anticipate that you will gain less than an inch in height. In fact, you might actually lose a tiny bit of height. This is partly because your tests have shown a clear downward trend in your body's growth hormone over the last few years. Also, because the nanites are going to be creating a very slight compression effect to increase your bone density, your body will be able to support your new weight.\"While this process is ongoing the nanites need to be working 24/7. To that end, our recommendation is that you enter a two year suspended state in the alternate reality of Nova Terra while being monitored by our staff. There have been no problems found with extended suspension and it has been very helpful in long-term treatments of other illnesses, so you have very little to worry about.\"Taking a deep breath, the doctor looked between Xavier and his aunt. \"I know it is a lot to take in, but how does all of this sound? Do you have any questions or concerns?\"\"It is a bit overwhelming, truthfully.\" It took Xavier a couple moments to process before his deep voice rumbled out. \"So I'm going to be dead to the world, out for two years?\"\"Ah, not quite,\" The doctor jumped to his feet and grabbed a stack of papers from a cupboard, handing them to Xavier. \"Suspended animation is a bit different from what you see in the movies. The classic example is someone frozen in ice for some time and then thawed out later, right? That is not what we are talking about. With the advent of Nova Terra, technology has developed to the point where we can take an individual's mind to a new world, leaving their body behind for a short period of time.\"In order to facilitate longer periods of uninterrupted gameplay, Horizon, the company that makes Nova Terra, has developed what they call 'extended suspension' through the use of special game pods that monitor the health of the user and provide nutrition, muscle stimulation, and waste removal. Think of it as an extended vacation from your body.\"\"You'll be playing a game for two years straight,\" cut in Julia.\"Well, actually,\" the doctor said, holding up a finger, \"You will be playing a game for 14 years due to the time dilation. Nova Terra has a pretty drastic time dilation at 7 to 1. So a single hour in the real world is equivalent to seven hours in Nova Terra.\"\"Wait, so I'm going to be 30 when I get out?\" Xavier asked, horrified.\"No, no,\" the doctor laughed, waving his hands. \"You will be 18. Only two actual years will have passed. You will have a total of 30 years of memories when you include the 16 years you have already been alive. It is a pretty interesting phenomenon when you think about it, but it is actually completely natural. In the real world, it is called being in a Flow state, where time seems to shrink or stretch based on the activity you are doing. Nova Terra keeps you in a constant Flow state, stretching time so that you experience seven times as much as you would in the outside world.\"\"That does not seem safe at all.\"\"It is, though. The human brain is a magnificent thing, and we have almost thirty years of research and study that demonstrate no side effects from this. You do not need to worry.\"Xavier had something of a love-hate relationship with games, especially with the full immersion games that had come out within the last twenty years. While he had the mental capacity for any game he could get his hands on, he was hampered by the fact that all of the full immersion games stimulated the muscles of the player to prevent atrophy, which, in his case, would result in his skin being destroyed.Still, Xavier was exceptionally bright. Julia's work brought her into contact with many geniuses in every field and Xavier, who often accompanied her, never had any trouble keeping up with them. Despite his youth, he had finished primary and secondary school years ago and had even completed two degrees, one in Business Management and another in Urban Planning. After all, what else is there to do besides school when you could not move about?It was a shame that, despite his smarts, he was unable to live as a normal person. Xavier had long dreamed of being able to see the new worlds that virtual reality had begun to offer, which made this idea immediately attractive. Xavier glanced at his aunt, who was watching him, trying to guess his feelings about this.Xavier couldn't help himself and let a smile spread across his face. Up to this point, his life had been tedious. It wasn't as if he lacked for anything, no it was the opposite. There was no struggle, no effort needed. If he wanted something, and it wasn't bad for his health, then his doting aunt bought it for him.\u00a0", "Forget the fact that he was many times richer than she was, she wouldn't even let him use the absurd amount of money his parents had left him. Hemmed in and coddled by all who met him, the thing he wanted the most was freedom, and the idea of being in an adventure game like Nova Terra was an amazing opportunity to get that freedom.Julia Lee gave a small sigh of relief. She knew her nephew well and it was obvious that Xavier was excited about this idea. After a few more minutes of talking some of the details through, she nodded at the doctor. Xavier would be sent into the game where he would spend the next two years of real time while the treatment worked to repair his body.The papers signed and a date set for the following week, Xavier and Julia made their way out of the hospital and toward the massive all-terrain vehicle that they drove. However, as soon as they exited the hospital doors, the flash of lights announced the gathering of paparazzi that seemed to follow Julia around like gnats.\"Ms. Lee, Ms. Lee, is it true that you are engaged?\"\"Ms. Lee, what are your thoughts on the rising energy costs?\"\"Ms. Lee, you are being accused of setting up a hostile takeover of DeHauser Energy. Do you have any comments on that?\"Their security was expecting it, and it wasn't long before they were able to force their way through to the car. Pushing past the crowding reporters, the leader of the security team opened the butterfly door of their vehicle and pulled down the ramp before guiding Xavier's chair up into the car and into its place where it locked in.\"Thanks, Henry,\" Xavier nodded at the guard.\"Of course, Master Xavier,\" the guard responded, his stern face breaking into a smile. All of Julia's employees adored their giant charge. Glancing back at the paparazzi pushing against the rest of the security team, Henry grimaced. \"Sorry about all the noise, sir. Next time we'll use the private entrance.\"\"It's not a problem, Henry. The pictures are good for my aunt's publicity.\"Julia, a drop-dead gorgeous blonde with a figure that even gods would kill for, was the most eligible bachelorette in the world, helped, of course, by the fact that she was also a minority shareholder and the CEO of Atlas, the largest energy company in the world. Rich, smart and beautiful, it was no wonder that the tabloids followed her like puppies. Seeing her grumble, Xavier couldn't hold in his smile.The majority of the ride home was spent discussing Xavier's coming immersion. Julia had played Nova Terra since its release and was well established. Combined with the fact that the majority of her business was done in the virtual city of Fantasia, Julia was well versed with virtual reality.\"Xavier, you should join me when you get into Nova Terra. This game is not the same as other games, and it takes a lot of work to get established.\" Julia flipped her hair over her shoulder.\"Come on, you know that work is the last thing I'm afraid of,\" replied Xavier with a smile.\"I know, I know. But you don't understand how different it is. It is not like any MMO that you have ever played. There is no grinding, no leveling up, no health bars or anything like that. It's pretty much real life and it's as dangerous. To some extent, it is like the wild west. Untamed and lawless. Unless you have the strength to protect yourself, you are at the mercy of other players.\"\"What about quests and storylines?\" asked Xavier. \"Don't games have to have a story?\"\"They practically don't exist,\" grumbled Julia. \"Normal games have level progression; Nova Terra only has mastery. There are no experience points or anything of the sort. Want to learn to fight with a sword? Start practicing. Want to learn magic? Figure it out. There is no system assist or any sort of auto-targeting. The same is true of storylines. At least, there isn't a 'story' that anyone has discovered. The game has history, but there is no final boss.\"\"Wait, then what do you do?\"\"You do what you want to do. You can do anything. You can live in a city and make shoes for NPCs. You can join a pioneering expedition and settle a wilderness town. You can hunt monsters and slay dragons. Well, not that last one. At least, no one has been able to yet. We're working on it, though.\"\"You've been playing for some time, right? What have you been doing?\" asked Xavier. He knew his aunt played Nova Terra, but they had never talked about it since he wasn't able to participate, and she didn't want to make him jealous.\"Oh man, let me tell you! We have the best mercenary corps in the entire game. Prettiest, too,\" replied Julia with a smug look. \"But this illustrates my point. It took me four years in real time to build up the Society of Roses. That is almost 30 years in Nova Terra! You can't step into the game and expect to make quick progress.\"First I had to establish the group and then gather players. I mean, it took countless years for everyone to train to the point where they were good enough at fighting to actually complete the missions! And that is not even taking into account our reputation as a group. We only managed to get a permit to build our headquarters in the capital a year ago. If you take the time dilation into account it actually took us 21 years in game. 21 years of calculated moves and hard work.\"We had to work our way up, managing our relationships with other groups and the powers in the world. Because it is not like a game where each NPC has a couple quests and lines of dialogue. They all have their own lives. To the point that you could accept a quest and then come back and find that the person who gave it to you went and died. Or started a new business. Or got married or had a kid. At the end of the day, Nova Terra is another world. And like the real world, life moves along without you. If you're serious about going it alone, you'd better be prepared to work for what you want. If you put in the time and effort, you will be okay. Nothing of value is going to come easy, but everything is achievable.\"Furrowing his brow, Xavier thought for a minute, his eyes drifting across the scenery outside his window.\"Then where is the fun? Isn't the point of a game to provide entertainment? If Nova Terra is so hard, how is that different than real life? There has to be something about it that draws people in. I mean, almost 70% of the world plays.\"\"Oh, don't get me wrong. It is fun. Really fun. It isn't as uncomfortable as real life. Like, you don't sweat no matter how hot you get. Everyone's hair looks great no matter how much you have been running. It is like life, but with most of the uncomfortable and inconvenient parts edited out. But Nova Terra is more than that. When it first came out, it was a game, but when they built Fantasia it became as important as the real world.\"\"Fantasia? You mean the city? Isn't Fantasia in the Nova Terra?\"\"Not quite. It sits parallel to it. So you can hop back and forth. Think same universe, different planet. I do almost all of my business there because of the time dilation. That is the only way I have time to play.\" Julia smirked. \"Almost everyone in the business world uses Fantasia to handle their business and Nova Terra to relax.\"Seeing the large smile on his aunt's face, Xavier couldn't help but think back over the many years he had lived with her. She had gained custody of him from birth after a tragic accident left his parents dead. Julia, only nineteen at the time, had stepped up to play the part of both mother and father to him. Not to mention, Julia had taken on a leadership role in his parents' multi-million dollar energy corporation.Xavier hadn't even made it to the hospital to be born when a drunk driver turned his parents' joy at the coming birth of their first child to a nightmare. His parents had survived long enough to be brought back to the hospital emergency room, but both passed away during surgery. Miraculously, Xavier survived both the crash and the emergency c-section that followed. His aunt rushed to the hospital only to find her sister and brother-in-law dead.Xavier had grown at a furious rate, dwarfing other children of similar age. His bones and muscles grew so strong and dense that he was walking by the time he was two months old and was almost four feet tall by the time he was one. This astounding growth left the pediatricians who were monitoring him dumbfounded. His ever-increasing diet fueled his rapid growth, and the doctors could only attribute it to some unknown form of gigantism.As he got older, he began having problems. His bones, organs, and skin struggled to keep up with his massive frame. Almost daily his skin would stretch and split, leaving bloody trails across his body as his skin cells tried to duplicate. Despite his abnormal strength and the size of his bones, gravity began to prove too much for him. Facing this difficult situation, the doctors were at a complete loss, trying one failed treatment after another.For the past sixteen years, Xavier had gone in and out of hospitals around the world, trying every conceivable method to solve the issue with his body. His aunt, who had proved to be a successful businesswoman in her own right, had spared no expense. She wasted a veritable fortune on treatment and research no matter how obscure.Xavier was a gift from the gods as far as medical researchers were concerned. Due to his strange condition that doctors still had not identified, he suffered close to zero cell degeneration in combination with energetic bone growth, which would have been a dream come true if it were not for the fact that Xavier's skin did not share this trait and could not keep up with the massive increases in muscle and bone growth that he experienced.Normally, an object that grew in size was subject to the square-cube law. In short, the square-cube law stated that as something grows or diminishes, its volume grows and shrinks faster than its surface area. The larger something is, the greater its volume in relation to its surface area. Consequently, most humans with gigantism found that their bones, muscles, organs, and tendons could not keep up with their body's increased volume, causing them to struggle to support their new weight.Growing to the same height as Xavier, a person would be at least 16 times stronger than the typical six-foot adult. However, the square-cube law stated that at the same time, the strength to weight ratio would change from 1:1 to 1:4. That is, the person would be four times heavier than they were strong, causing them to collapse under their own body weight.In this unprecedented case, Xavier's muscles and bones were almost 32 times stronger than normal, allowing him to move his 840 pound body like a regular sized person. However, despite the fact that Xavier's body was much stronger than was reasonable for someone with his condition, far surpassing the limits of normal humans, his weight still caused him to struggle to support his body.In fact, by standing to his feet, he easily broke the World's Strongest Man deadlift record. Unfortunately, the pressure of gravity on his bones had caused numerous stress fractures in his hips and legs over the years, and, by the age of eight, Xavier had found himself unable to walk without a mechanized brace.To complicate his situation, his medical condition caused him to be threatened by the danger of literally ripping through his own skin. The result of his massive musculature meant that any sudden action would cause his skin to tear open, accompanied of course by lots of blood and pain. Careful movement was still possible, and through technological aids like his electric wheelchair and his mechanized brace, his life could have a modicum of normalcy.However, the real mystery was Xavier's synaptic response time. This was a conundrum that left every scientist and doctor in the world puzzled beyond belief. The electrical impulse from the brain to a part of the body travels around 220 miles per hour, causing the average reaction time of a human to be 0.22 seconds. However, due to his increased size, physics would anticipate that Xavier's response time would fall to 0.98 seconds, under five times slower.Yet, despite all of this, Xavier exhibited the opposite. His average reaction time was 0.14 seconds, comparable to that of the best athletes in the world. Many theories evolved as to how such a large body could produce such an astounding reaction time. The best theory to date suggested that Xavier's nervous system was both larger and more robust than the average person's. This meant that the amount of information that could pass through it was greater, allowing for better information flow.Unfortunately, despite his body performing above and beyond the norm in some ways, Xavier was, without question, handicapped by his extreme weight and his inability to prevent himself from being injured at every turn. Sitting still, Xavier was normal, yet he was unable to live even close to a normal life. He had spent more time in a wheelchair than out of one, and it was only the carefully curated lifestyle that his aunt forced on him that kept him in good shape.", "For the rest of the ride, Xavier listened as his aunt shared some of the stories of her years as the commander of the Society of Roses. It became apparent that she considered Nova Terra to be a parallel life. Knowing her massive achievements in the real world, Xavier was surprised to hear the passion in her voice when she talked about what she had accomplished in this game. Even more surprising to Xavier was the incredible influence that each of Julia's lives seemed to have on the other. The more she spoke, the more the two lives seemed to blend together.After getting home, Julia got him settled in his room and reminded him that his Taijiquan instructor was going to be coming over in half an hour. While he waited, Xavier opened up his computer to do some research. From what he knew already, Nova Terra was a gamer's dream, but it differed from many of the games that existed previously.\"Information on Nova Terra,\" Xavier said, watching the computer create a virtual library for him. Seeing the huge amount of information still streaming in, he narrowed the search. \"Basic game information.\" Soon he had a manageable amount of information in front of him, and he began to browse.Noinherent  classes, no visible stats, no damage counters, the game was touted as the first true alternate reality. If you could do something in the real world, you could do it in Nova Terra. The ads boasted unlimited freedom, restricted only by ability and resources. Judging by the variety of posts on the message boards, it wasn't an overstatement to say that you could do anything in Nova Terra. There were, of course, some restrictions and protections in place to prevent people from committing certain criminal acts.Xavier had not even scratched the surface of the information on the game when a knock at his door let him know that his instructor had arrived. Clicking open the door from his chair, he moved to the edge of his massive chair and grabbed his robotic frame. Strapping his legs into the supports he pushed a button on the side of his chair, and with a hydraulic hiss, his chair pushed him up into a standing position.After making sure the leg supports engaged, Xavier attached his chest harness and stepped up to greet the small old lady who walked into the room. Standing at five feet tall, Ms. Chen was dainty, with short hair and a gentle looking face.Despite the fact that he was almost twice her size and countless times her weight, Xavier greeted her with the utmost respect. She had been teaching him for many years and was more of a grandmother to him than a teacher. The fact that he had once watched her completely thrash ten of his aunt's best bodyguards at the same time helped, as well.\"You hurt yourself again, child?\" Ms. Chen asked in concern as she came over, examining his bound hand.\"It's nothing much,\" laughed Xavier. \"Master, did my aunt tell you that I'll be going into Nova Terra next week? The doctor says I'll be immersed for two years.\"\"Hmmm... Yes, child, she did. I don't like the idea. One should never replace reality with fantasy. But, if it will help you, then you should go for it,\" she replied, patting one of his large hands. \"Enough. It's time for us to practice. We don't have time to waste if you are going to be locked away for two years. I expect you to continue practicing while you are in, so don't think you can slack off.\"\"Haha, of course, Master. Actually, the time dilation is such that it will seem like I am spending 14 years in there. Who knows, maybe by the time I come out, I'll be a master,\" joked Xavier.\"Hah. As if. It will be enough if you are no longer as clumsy as an elephant,\" grumped Ms. Chen, pushing him into his first stance.With the assistance of the mechanical frame, Xavier was able to move through each of the stances that they had been working on. He had been doing Taijiquan for almost 11 years, but the nature of his condition had made progress rather hard. Ms. Chen often complained that his inability to apply hardness, or explosive power, because of his skin's condition, crippled his mastery of the art. Much of Taijiquan focused on softness, and in that regard, Xavier was well accomplished.Passing from stance to stance smoothly, Xavier focused on his breathing, relaxing his body to avoid stiffness and gathering his strength in anticipation of each of the moves. While he never released that power, he could still feel it inside himself. There was a slight clumsiness that could not be overcome due to the mechanical frame, but overall, Ms. Chen was satisfied with his efforts. After two hours of careful practice, she climbed up on Xavier's massive chair to give him a kiss on the forehead.Since he was rather sweaty, Xavier moved to his bathroom after saying goodbye to his teacher. He had designed his personal living space so he didn't have to duck as he walked through the door and into the massive shower. Peeling off his sweaty clothes, he showered and got changed. Each and every one of his actions was focused and deliberate. The more he thought about living in a world free of the danger of hurting himself with a simple movement, the more excited he became. Soon he was back in his chair, browsing about the game again, though he was getting a bit frustrated by the lack of concrete information.Despite the monstrous number of hits he got when he searched for Nova Terra, it was evident that much about the game was still hidden. There was almost no information on the specifics of the game, only general discussions about players' activities. After three hours of somewhat fruitless searching, Xavier finally gave up. He would get to experience it for himself soon, so it did not bother him too much.That night at dinner, Xavier talked with his aunt about his upcoming immersion into Nova Terra. The more he learned about the game, the more excited he was. The very thought of being able to move without restriction made him want to dance. He could not yet, but soon he would be able to act on that desire.The days passed slowly, too slowly for Xavier, whose anticipation grew every hour. Thankfully, there were tests to do to make sure nothing would go wrong with the immersion process, otherwise, he might have gone crazy. As the day got closer his regular routine was interrupted as the hospital set up his pod and had him try it out.The first time he went into immersion was only for a few minutes with a headset. Having put on the helmet, Xavier appeared above a three-dimensional house without a roof. Floating next to him was a small ball of energy representing the doctor who walked him through using his mind to control his avatar. Xavier moved things about in the house, selecting and rotating the furniture and turning lamps on and off as he moved from room to room.Once he had finished that, the experiences began to get more and more involved and challenging. As the week progressed, he started to play small games; a flying simulation, a basic strategy game, a building game. Finally, he moved from the headset to a full body session, lying down in his pod and entering a game with giant robots fighting in a city.All the games were fun but only stoked Xavier's desire to play Nova Terra. The doctors could sense his restlessness, but they did not have him enter virtual reality at all over the three days leading up to his full immersion. Instead, they put him on a strict diet, telling him to get lots of rest. Too excited to sleep, Xavier spent most of his time reading about other people's experiences in the game.Nova Terra was another world. Not only did people play for fun, but fortunes could be won and lost. Huge amounts of money had been injected into the game and the sheer quantity of people playing tied the game's economy to the real world's economy with bands of steel. More and more people were playing, for their livelihood and success in the game could be success in real life.For Xavier, who had never enjoyed the opportunity to pursue life the way others were able to because of his physical condition, Nova Terra promised a level of normalcy he had only dreamed of. While swords and magic and dragons were not normal, at least he could experience them the same way as everyone else.Sitting next to the floor-to-ceiling window in his room, Xavier looked over the well-manicured lawn and neatly pruned trees that dotted the southern side of the estate. For years, he had been trapped. Trapped by his body, trapped by the perfection of a life where everything was handled for him. It was almost time to break free.Two days before he was to go under, Julia informed him that she had scheduled a board meeting for Xavier to deal with some last details. Normally, she would handle all the official business in Fantasia, but there were a couple things that required Xavier's signature. As Xavier's guardian, and the owner of twenty percent of Atlas, Julia had an incredible amount of authority, but there were some things that she refused to do.Despite his dislike for having to deal with the board, Xavier could not get away from the fact that he owned more than sixty percent of the largest energy company in the world. Besides, even if he did not want the trouble that it brought, he could not deny that it afforded him the best care the world could buy. If the price was having to face the pressure of the other board members every once and a while and sign some documents, then it was worth it.That afternoon Xavier followed his aunt into the car and looked at the documents. Because he would be in treatment for two years, the other board members were concerned that the largest shareholder would not be available to vote, which would impair the company's ability to react to the market situation. Julia had thought up a plan to deal with it, but it required Xavier's presence to put it into play.As the majority shareholder, Xavier had almost complete control of the company. However, due to his complicated condition, he rarely exercised it, letting Julia and the other shareholders handle almost everything. It was only when there was a major dispute that he stepped in. \"Even so, I would much rather they never needed me,\" Xavier sighed to himself as he read through the file Julia had prepared.After a twenty minute ride, their car pulled into the private entrance at Atlas headquarters, and Henry helped Xavier navigate down the ramp and into the building. A private elevator took them up to the seventieth floor where the other board members were already waiting around a large mahogany table.\"Sorry for making you wait.\" Xavier's slow, calm voice seemed to have a suppressive effect, easing the nervous energy in the room.\"Not at all, Xavier,\" one of the board members hurried to assure him. \"We only just got here ourselves.\"Taking his place at the head of the table, Xavier accepted a glass of water from a secretary with a smile, taking a moment to look around the room. Once his aunt was seated, Xavier opened up the document on the screen and pointed to it.\"As I am sure you all know, in a couple days I am starting an advanced medical treatment that will take two years. There has been some concern as to how the company will handle decisions during my absence, so we are meeting to clear that up,\" Xavier said in his slow, deep voice, \"Please look at the documents provided. Ms. Lee, please go over our arrangement.\"\"Thank you,\" Julia nodded at her nephew and, standing, she looked around the table. \"You are all aware that Xavier prefers to be hands-off, so this treatment will actually work out pretty well. Xavier's treatment will include full immersion in Nova Terra. He will need approximately three months to adjust to the alternate reality, after which he has agreed to make himself available for virtual meetings in Fantasia. Atlas has substantial property in Fantasia, where he is planning to reside while he is not in the game.\"As normal, I will continue handling any signing he needs to do and he has authorized me to determine what is necessary to bring to his attention. As per usual, everyone is allowed to contact him as normal during the course of his immersion, but for the next three months, you will need to send any messages you have for Xavier to me. Once those three months have passed, he has agreed to keep regular contact hours, as usual.\"Last, but not least, you will notice that there is a non-disclosure agreement in each of your packages. This covers not only Xavier's medical condition and any details regarding or related to his treatment, but also his participation in Nova Terra and any details surrounding it. The official line is going to stay the same as normal. Xavier is undergoing monitored medical treatment at a private location. As always, you are required to sign these non-disclosure agreements, and I need not remind everyone that, should you spill even a hint of anything regarding Xavier, I will ruin you.\"\u00a0", "\u00a0 The board members shifted under Julia's frosty stare until Xavier coughed.\"Thank you, I think they understand.\" Xavier patted his aunt's arm. Looking around the room, he continued, \"I have the utmost trust that you will all keep these affairs amongst ourselves. We have worked well together for years, and, though we are moving into a new situation, I'm sure we will continue to work well together.\" Somehow hearing Xavier's calm, measured tone seemed to scare them even more than Julia's harsh words, and the board members rushed to assure Xavier that they would comply with the non-disclosure agreement. Due to his age, they were bound to sign at his request, and they all remembered what had happened a number of years back when a former board member had let some things regarding Xavier's health slip to the media. Suffice it to say, he had immediately retired and vanished into the night.Positions on Atlas' board were fiercely contested, and no one was willing to forfeit their coveted position. After all, as the largest and most advanced energy company in the world, Atlas had its hands in countless different industries. From technology to manufacturing, from military development to consumer goods, Atlas powered the world.This gave those on the board immense personal power, but the fear of losing that power bound them to Xavier and Julia's side. As the majority shareholder by an overwhelming amount, Xavier's position was very stable, and his savvy aunt had taught him how to leverage that stability.After a round or two of questions about the specifics of how the next few months would be handled and an overview of the company's overall plan for the next two years, the meeting broke up. Letting out a sigh of relief after seeing everyone sign the documents, Julia and Xavier headed up to her office on the top floor. Despite owning most of the company, Xavier refused to have an office of his own, instead using his aunt's when he was at the company. \"Man, I get so nervous when I have to go to board meetings,\" sighed Xavier.\"You did well, hun. Besides, they were more afraid of you than you were of them,\" said Julia with a laugh. \"Your business face is pretty intimidating.\"\"What do you mean, my business face? This is my regular face,\" said Xavier, rolling his eyes.\"Yeah, that too,\" Julia teased, giving him a kiss on the forehead. Despite the fact that Xavier was seated, she still had to stand on her tiptoes.\"Is this going to mean more work for you?\"\"A little bit,\" Julia smiled, \"but I can handle it. Plus, I am only holding on until you turn 18. Once you are an adult, you will have to take over, which means I'll be free.\"\"Then you'll finally have time to go on dates with one of the hundred guys who called you yesterday,\" countered Xavier with a straight face, earning himself a scowl.\"Forget it. I am too busy making my guild the number one guild in the world.\"\"Oh yeah? How close are you?\" \"We are doing pretty well.\" Julia sighed. \"There are a lot of good players in Nova Terra and, unfortunately, they play together. We rank in the top ten, though the rankings tend to fluctuate a good bit. Considering the restrictions on our guild, I am quite proud of what we have achieved.\"\"What sort of restrictions?\"\"Well, we only accept women into the guild, and we are a pure mercenary corps, which means we do not take on anything that isn't a mercenary job.\" Seeing her nephew's confused look, Julia smiled. \"There are many things that a guild can do in Nova Terra. We handle requests from other players and NPCs. Other guilds might trade in luxury goods or sell production items in a store.\"Some even hunt for rare creatures or explore the game. With how large Nova Terra is, people haven't even scratched the surface of the game. According to the rumors floating around, there is an entire storyline that we have not activated yet. But that is a rumor at this point. With all the different things that we could choose to do in Nova Terra, we have decided to focus on mercenary jobs.\"While we might take on a job to guard a merchant caravan or a bunch of miners, we won't run our own caravan or do the digging for ore ourselves. We do have a production branch, but we use everything they produce ourselves. Because we restrict ourselves to a specific kind of work, it is a bit harder for us to expand than guilds with a diversified portfolio.\"\"That makes sense, I guess. All of those restrictions are self-imposed, right? What made you decide to play that way?\" \"That is an old story,\" Julia paused to tuck a stray hair behind her ear. \"About thirty years ago, I was in another guild, but the leader was a total jerk, so I quit. When I quit, a bunch of the other ladies quit, as well. We wanted to show him that we could make a guild that was even better than his.\"\"Thirty years ago? That would have made you, what? Negative two years old?\"\"No, thirty years ago in the game. This was four years ago in real life.\"\"Right. Time dilation. So, what happened to the old guild?\"\"They ended up disbanding about three years ago after we crushed them in a tournament. When we left, we took a good chunk of their core players and the three best player versus player casters in the game. Player versus player combat is a huge part of the game, so losing us crippled their ability to compete with the top tier guilds. Most guilds solve their problems through duels or team fights, so after we left, they suffered. All the other guilds started to pick on them. I mean, we did too, but we actually had a reason.\"After they collapsed, we continued to grow as we found other players like us. I don't think there was ever an official conversation about it, the rules formed naturally based on what we are all interested in. I mean, there are only sixty of us. So it isn't like we are one of the big guilds. Sixty players is a nice size because we can split into squads of eleven. Ten mercenaries and one officer. We have five total squads with five players in our production division. The five officers are our guild officers, as well. Overall we have a neat little family.\"\"It sounds like it.\" Xavier could tell how proud his aunt was by the huge smile on her face as she talked about her guild. The intercom buzzed, and Julia's secretary informed them that the lawyers had arrived to handle the final paperwork for the medical treatment. It did not take long for the documents to get filed with Atlas' lawyers, and after finalizing the documents for his immersion, there was nothing left for Xavier but to wait. Waiting suited Xavier fine - after all, he felt like had been waiting for his whole life. He would leave the business stuff to his aunt while he got ready for adventure.The last two days passed, the time of immersion arrived, and his tearful aunt brought him to the hospital. The whole ride over she fretted and tried to convince him to immediately contact her when he got into the game. With a high mastery character and a fully formed guild, she could help him get used to the game in the shortest time possible - an offer that Xavier immediately rejected, of course.\"I want to play by myself at first. You know, take my time and explore. I have 14 years, for goodness sake. At the very least, I want a year on my own. Plus, your guild doesn't allow men, so I can't join anyway.\"\"Believe me, Xavier, the game isn't easy. Especially in the beginning. We have tons of experienced players who can teach you the ropes. Plus, the girls have always wanted to meet you! I am positive that they would make an exception for you, if you wanted to join. Like I said, it is not an official rule or anything like that. It just ended up that way.\"\"And I'm sure all the ladies in your guild are very nice, but I would like to spend some time on my own,\" Xavier said, suppressing a shudder. Thinking about being surrounded by innumerable women like his aunt made his skin crawl. He loved her dearly, but one overprotective, clingy aunt was more than enough.Unable to move him from this position no matter how much she threatened or cajoled him, Julia finally huffed and let it be, but only after extracting a promise that he would at least call her within the first year. A year in the game was only a bit more than a month and a half in real time anyway. The game had a video chat feature that would allow them to connect easily, and Julia went over how to use it with Xavier three times to make sure he understood.A few hours later, Xavier had been prepared by the staff and was about to enter his custom-built pod. Bending down was awkward with his braces but Xavier bore with the discomfort so that his aunt could give him a hug, Xavier consoled her in his slow, deep voice. \"Don't worry, Aunt Julia, I can still communicate with you and the doctors while in Nova, so I will be sure to let them know if anything is a problem. Think of this like boarding school. Plus, I will see you soon in game.\" Straightening back up, Xavier stepped over to the massive pod and watched his aunt leave the room. Looking around for his last view of the real world for the next two years, he shed his hospital gown, proving to the curious nurses that he was indeed proportional all over, and lay down in the pod, which began to fill up with a nanite-infused gel from the large nanite colony on the wall. Twice the size of a traditional full immersion pod, the device that had been customized for Xavier was quite impressive. Housing better processing power, multiple power system failsafes, a state of the art monitoring suite and every other feature one could imagine apart from a mini-bar, the pod had cost a pretty penny. The researchers who had proposed the method of treatment had proposed something much less expensive, but Julia was not about to let her nephew use a regular full immersion pod and had ordered it rebuilt from the ground up. Xavier had wanted to pay for it himself, but Julia, ever business minded, had worked out a special deal with Horizon to provide special state-of-the-art backup batteries that Atlas had developed for their pods in exchange for this custom built pod.Almost instantly the strong anesthetic put him under, and he fell into a deep sleep. Outside the pod, the doctor was glaring at the curious nurses while keeping one eye on the controls for the pod. It had taken almost three years of experimentation to come up with a mixture of anesthetic that was strong enough to put Xavier out without shutting his organs down, so the doctor paid special attention to the pod's vital sign indicators to make sure there were no problems.After Xavier was asleep, the hospital staff got busy attaching various tubes, sensors, and stimulators to his massive pod. Not only would the pod ensure that Xavier would get the proper amounts of nutrients, but they would also cycle him through the nanite treatment, flushing out old nanites and introducing new ones in. From here all the parties involved, including Julia, could monitor his situation to make sure that everything was going well.Once they were sure that everything was stable and that the game had loaded, the doctor moved everyone out of the room except for the monitoring nurses. At Julia's insistence, there would be two nurses in the room at all times to monitor Xavier and make sure nothing dangerous was happening. \"Good luck, young man,\" the doctor whispered as he headed off to settle his next patient.\u00a0\u00a0", "It wasn't his first time in virtual reality, so the deep darkness with the calming blue loading bar came as no surprise to Xavier. In fact, it made his heart beat all the faster. Well, his proverbial heart at least.The world Xavier loaded into was a soft white color stretching endlessly in all directions. Lacking a body, Xavier floated around for a couple seconds before a gentle cough indicated that there was someone behind him. Turning his attention to face the figure of an unnaturally beautiful woman clad in a shimmering blue dress, Xavier would have smiled if he had a mouth with which to do so.\"Hello, traveler. I am Myst, your guide to the world of Nova Terra. As this is your first time logging into Nova Terra, I will take you through the tutorial. During this tutorial, we will work together to create a personal avatar for you to use during your stay in Nova Terra. Please be aware of a couple of restrictions on this avatar. First, you cannot swap your gender. Second, you are limited to a 20% overall change in your appearance. Third, your physical stats will be generated based on a full body scan and a few minor tests and initially will be linked to your real life body's condition. Do you have any questions, traveler?\"\"Uh...yeah. What stats are available?\" Xavier had done as much as he could to prepare for this chance to play Nova Terra, but there was surprisingly little information outside the game.\"That is a great question, traveler. There are a few stats that you can see by saying Status. Please do so, and I will explain each.\"After saying \"status\", a simple blue window popped up in front of Xavier. \"Thank you, traveler. As you can see from your status, you currently have nothing filled in. Once we begin the process of creating your avatar, many of those fields will be filled. Apart from your name, which is the final choice you will make before you begin your journey in Nova Terra, you will be presented with a number of race choices as well as a series of tests based off of your body scan. All six of the main races are available except in extreme cases, and some rare races are locked unless you meet specific qualifications.\"Without taking a breath, Myst continued, \"Your max health and max mana will display in your status, as will your titles and any uncommon conditions, however, the rest of your stats will be hidden, as that would ruin the immersive experience. That said, I can still tell you about the basic stats. Strength governs how strong your avatar is as well as how much damage you do when using a melee weapon. Dexterity governs your avatar's coordination and speed in addition to how much ranged projectile damage your character does.\"Constitution is your avatar's ability to take damage as well as your endurance and damage resistance. Intelligence will govern how fast your mana pool recharges and how quickly you can process information. Wisdom is your avatar's ability to make good choices and relate to other people. Finally, Charisma will govern how well other people relate to your avatar. Please note that there are hidden stats, as well, that you will have to discover on your own. Do you have any other questions, traveler?\"Xavier thought for a moment before responding. \"How does my Intelligence going up change my perception of the game? I mean, how does the game simulate a person getting smarter?\"Myst stood still for a moment and then shivered, her perfect face taking on a slightly more human look. \"That is a great question, traveler. The computer controller in your pod has been fitted with a completely non-invasive system assist that will slow your perception of the game's time to allow you more time to think as well as several system assists that will help you do specific things like math or recalling information. Do you have any other questions, traveler?\"\"Yes. How do I increase stats if I cannot actually see them? And what about skills? I don't see a spot for them.\"\"That is a great question, traveler. As you may be aware, there are no levels to speak of in Nova Terra. Instead, as you acquire skill and practice various activities, you will find yourself increasing in proficiency. To have an idea of where a player stands in comparison to others, they will need to compare their abilities, as in real life. There are a near infinite number of tasks that can grant you increased proficiency through training like gaining titles, skill at completing tasks, finding hidden stats, the rank of monsters you kill, and quests you complete. Think of each of these things as mini-games that have been optimized to help you gain mastery of various tasks.\"You might think of titles as a count of the things you have done in your adventures. Gaining a title is as simple as cooking your first meal to as complex as slaying a dragon and saving a princess. Completing some tasks will grant you specific bonuses while others will add to your reputation. In addition, there are some rewards, called advancements, that come with specific ability or skill increases based on your race. Additionally, please note that biological changes in your body will also be factored when you log in, which is why regular exercise is recommended for every player.\"In short, skills are handled the same way they are in the real world. While skill levels are hidden in order to increase immersion, the more you do something, the better you will be at it. Do you have any other questions, traveler?\"\"Wait, then I have to manually do and learn everything?\"\"That is a great question, traveler. That is partially correct. To increase your proficiency in a skill, you must use it repeatedly, like in real life. The learning time will, however, be shorter than the real world, and the more you practice, the more the system will assist you. Otherwise, you must master skills on your own. Do you have any other questions, traveler?\"\"So, apart from the six fields in my status, I can't see anything else about my progress?\" asked Xavier, confused.\"That is a great question, traveler. That is incorrect, you will also be able to see quests, access an inventory, and contact the administrators. Nova Terra is not, however, a virtual reality game; rather it is a brand new world. It may be helpful for you if you think of Nova Terra as the real world with a few convenient advantages. Do you have any other questions, traveler?\"Thinking for a second, Xavier shook his head, \"No, thanks. I am ready to start creating my avatar.\"\"Excellent. Please wait while I complete your full scan and set up your base point.\" A moment passed as Myst took out a small device and waved it toward Xavier.The white landscape blurred and Xavier found himself in a modern-looking exercise facility. Machines of various kinds dotted the room, and music played in the background. For a brief moment, Xavier even thought he had returned to the real world. It was only when he realized that he was still disembodied that the feeling faded.\"Please enter the Fitness Assessment Android in front of you.\" Myst pointed with her clipboard at the human-shaped robot standing in the middle of the room.A thought sent Xavier floating toward the robot. As soon as he got close, there was a brief flash of darkness, and the eyes of the robot flickered to life. He looked down at the small, slim form of the robot with a mental frown. This new body was, at most, six feet tall and felt strange. It was as if his limbs were tied and no matter how much he wanted to, he couldn't stretch.\"Thank you, traveler. I will now adjust your Fitness Assessment Android to the correct size. Please move each of your limbs when I ask you to.\" Walking around behind him, Myst adjusted something on her pad and Xavier soon found himself much more comfortable.The change in perspective was disorienting, but after a couple moments, he got more familiar with this new body. Standing, he very slowly lifted his right hand to examine it. The robot was thinner than his real body and felt much lighter as well.\"How does this body feel, traveler?\"\"It's okay. A little lighter than my real body. I sort of feel like I am in water,\" commented Xavier, wiggling his fingers.\"Please wait while I recalibrate your weight, traveler.\" Myst fiddled with her pad once again. As she moved sliders around, Xavier felt the familiar sense of heaviness settle on him. While it still was not as intense as the feeling in the real world, at least he didn't feel like he was going to float away.Once the adjustment was done, Myst directed him to an area along one of the walls. A short track stretched along the wall with pillars set at regular intervals on both sides. Directing him to stand at one end, Myst told him to move down the track as fast as he could once the indicator light went on. After he finished, there was a short, pregnant pause.\"Thank you, traveler,\" Myst said in her sweet voice, a slight trace of confusion in her words. \"May I ask why you walked down the track? I only ask because your physical statistics indicate that you could have completed the track much more quickly, if you chose to.\"Wait, running? Xavier felt blood rush to his face as he was overcome with embarrassment. Though, could he be blamed for his mistake? The last sixteen years of his life had been spent moving carefully and deliberately. It was no longer a conscious decision but an inbuilt reaction. If he needed to move, he did so with caution. If he didn't, he kept his body as still as possible.\"Oh. Hmmm. Right.\" Xavier tried to cover his embarrassment by coughing. \"Can I try again?\"\"Of course, traveler. You can try the assessment as many times as you need in order to feel comfortable in your avatar,\" said Myst. \"Apart from the look, this avatar will feel exactly the same as your in-game avatar. The primary function of these tests is to make sure you feel comfortable in your new body.\"\"Oh?\" Xavier looked around at all the different machines. \"Okay, awesome. Let's try this running thing again.\"As he walked back to the starting line, Xavier made a conscious effort to lengthen his steps. No one understood the concept of effective incremental change better than he did. For his next attempt, he walked the course again, focusing on stretching his legs out to their full stride. The feeling of taking a full step without experiencing the ripping feeling of his skin breaking open was at first strange, quickly turning almost euphoric.After walking the course ten times, Xavier was able to break into a slow jog. He had jogged and even run when he was younger, so it was not a completely foreign movement to him. But it had been years. It was obvious from his awkward movements that he lacked practice.\"Hardness to softness, let go of stiffness. Hardness to softness.\" Repeating this mantra in his mind, Xavier focused on sensing the stiff, hard areas of his body as he jogged back and forth on the track. Taijiquan focused on dissolving stiffness in the practitioner's body in order to create softness, which proved to be a big help as Xavier got used to running.Like a machine, Xavier moved back and forth on the track. Sometimes jogging, sometimes walking, sometimes breaking into a sprint for a couple steps. He soon lost track of how many times he moved back and forth, but he had no intention of stopping. After feeling trapped in his own skin for so long, the unfettered movement was almost like a drug to him.At first, the most he could do was a few jogging steps as he walked back and forth. It was as if there was a mental block that slowed him down instinctively. That didn't last too long, and pretty soon he was able to jog the whole distance. After jogging back and forth twenty times, Xavier paused and stretched himself out. His muscles felt fatigued, but he was by no means tired. Still, it felt good to stretch .Once he finished stretching, he moved to the starting line again and resumed his jogging, this time concentrating on breaking into a run for a few steps in the middle of the track. Unfortunately, the track was short, and his long legs took him to the end in only a dozen steps.\"Excuse me, Myst?\" Xavier paused from his running. \"Do you have a longer track? I feel like this one is too short. I can't really run on it.\"Myst, seeing that the track was too short for him, adjusted something on her pad. The wall at the end of the track shot off into the distance as the room stretched. Once the straight track was a mile long, Myst stopped the wall and smiled at Xavier.\"Thanks.\" Excited by the long, open space in front of him, Xavier took off, speeding up as he progressed. Soon he was pounding down the track, his long stride sending him down the track at a fantastic rate. At a full-blown sprint, his stride was only a bit under twelve feet long, causing the impression that he was devouring the distance.Despite the building fatigue, Xavier could not stop running. He had heard about the phenomenon of the 'runner's high' and had seen his aunt running a lot, but, for him, it was different. As he flew down the track and back again over and over, one feeling dominated the rest. Freedom. The pain and fatigue that started to build in his legs, the breaths that grew more difficult, all of that was crushed beneath an overwhelming sense of lightness.For more than a decade, he had been shackled by his body, unable to express himself through any significant motion. So when he began to cut loose and run, it was like a dam bursting. All his pent-up feelings poured out in an unstoppable tide, forcing his legs to move. Almost completely absorbed in his frantic run, there was a very small part of Xavier that was thankful that his body was a robotic one. Otherwise, he would be bawling as he ran.The exercise room was well lit, and Myst showed no impatience, waiting until Xavier exhausted himself completely. Unsure of how long had passed, Xavier lay panting on the ground, completely spent from his mad dashes back and forth. At some point, the ends of the track had connected, creating a giant loop around the room so that he did not have to turn around, but Xavier hadn't noticed until he finally collapsed and was once more aware of his surroundings.", "\"Thank you for completing the running test, traveler,\" Myst said, producing a small device that looked like a phone. \"Please wait for a moment while I calibrate your results.\" Myst waved the device toward Xavier, who felt strength flooding through his body. Within a few seconds, his body felt revitalized and full of energy! Oblivious to Xavier's curious stare, Myst input some numbers into her pad and then escorted him over to a large pile of stones that had appeared in the middle of the giant room.\"Traveler, this next test is to determine the upper limit of your strength. Please select a rock and move it to the ring on the ground over there. You may repeat this action as many times as you want within sixty seconds.\"Nodding to himself, Xavier stretched his arms a bit and looked at the ring that was about four steps away from the pile. A regular person might have trouble moving even one of the large boulders that sat in the pile, especially considering that what would take Xavier four steps would take them twelve at the least. Xavier rested a hand on a particularly large stone, looking at Myst, who had pulled a stopwatch out of thin air.\"You may begin, traveler,\" said Myst with a smile.Taking a deep breath, Xavier squared his body up with the rock, bent his knees and lifted, promptly falling over. 'What the...' laying on his back on the ground Xavier stared at the large stone in his hands, wondering if it was made of styrofoam or something like that. He had braced himself to pick it up but the stone was so light that he had put way more strength into pulling it up than he needed, losing his balance and falling over!\"Um, Myst?\" Xavier said, holding the rock with one hand as he pushed himself to his feet. \"There is something wrong with your rocks.\"\"Traveler, would you like to abort the current test?\"\"Uh, yeah, sure.\" Xavier tossed the rock to the ground, watching in total confusion as it landed with an earth-shaking thump. The large stone acted like it was heavy while it was on the ground, but as soon as Xavier applied any force to it, the stone seemed to float! Testing an even larger stone, Xavier found the same to be true. No matter how big the object and how heavy it appeared to be, Xavier could lift it with absolute ease. \"Myst, what is going on?\"Myst paused for a moment before shivering, almost as if she reset. Then another moment passed as Myst shivered again. Waving her device once more, she stared intently at it and then frowned. The frown came and went so fast that Xavier almost thought he imagined it as the now happy Myst pushed some buttons on the device and waved a hand. \"Traveler, it seems that your strength currently exceeds the traditional metric, making it impossible to categorize. As a result, the anti-burden feature of Nova Terra activates every time you lift an object. Please wait while we re-calibrate the test.\"The rocks began to disappear one by one, and a series of massive logs appeared in their place. The logs, unlike the stones before them, were all the same size, but each had its weight written on the side.\"Please attempt to lift each log, traveler.\" Myst pointed to the lightest log which read 100 kg.If a kilogram was 2.20462 pounds, 100 kilograms would come out to 220.462 pounds, a weight that Xavier would not have any trouble with, even in the real world. His limit was closer to 230 kilograms or just over 500 pounds. Approaching the first log, Xavier grabbed the two handles set in the middle of the log and heaved it up. Like the rocks he lifted, Xavier could barely feel the weight at all. Apart from brief feedback when he first began to move the object that indicated it had weight to it, there was nothing. It was like lifting a piece of paper.\"How strange, it is almost like the game is compensating for the weight once I prove I can pick it up,\" thought Xavier.The next few logs were the same, and Xavier soon came to the 200 kg log. This was close to his lifting limit in the real world, but so far, he had not felt even the slightest amount of weight from the logs he had been lifting. Planting his feet, Xavier grasped the handles of the 200 kg log and lifted up. Unlike the rest of the logs, this one felt heavier, though by no means was it heavy. Tossing it to the ground, Xavier's brow furrowed. Despite being heavier, the 200 kg log still felt like it was only a couple pounds in his hands.'I can't be that strong.' he thought to himself.\"Traveler,\" Myst interrupted Xavier's thoughts, \"please lift the log at the very end.\"Looking down the line of logs, Xavier saw the log she was pointing to. It looked no different than the other logs apart from the 5000 kilogram weight written on the side. Quick mental math put it at 11,023.11 pounds, over five and a half tons! Xavier's first reaction was to laugh. Who in their right mind would try to lift that much weight? If the log rolled on him it would crush him! But then the strange reality he was experiencing settled on him, and he began to wonder.So far none of the weights he had lifted were a challenge in any way. Maybe the 5000 kg log was the same? Now curious, Xavier walked over to the log and rested his hand on it. \"Only one way to find out, I guess,\" Xavier thought, squaring up with the log. Placing his hands on the log's handles, Xavier took a deep breath, his massive fingers curling around them. Immediately, Xavier could feel the difference. The massive weight resisted his pull the way he expected it to and already he could feel himself fighting gravity. With a low roar, Xavier yanked upwards, his massive legs sinking down into the dirt. It was heavy. Probably, the heaviest thing Xavier had ever lifted! For the briefest moment Xavier was unsure if he could lift the log more than an inch or two off the ground but then his competitive spirit burst to life in his chest and the rest of his body engaged, straining upwards. A massive burst of strength suffused his muscles, and Xavier pulled the log up to his waist. He had seen bodybuilders lift large weights up over their head in a smooth motion using technique, but Xavier had no idea how to do that. Still, through brute force, he curled the log up from his waist to his chin, his arms and legs beginning to quiver. Panting, Xavier gritted his teeth and powered through, shoving the log up in the air over his head and holding it for a moment before jumping backward, letting go.With a tremendous bang, the five-ton log smashed into the ground, leaving a large dent where it landed. Xavier clenched his fist in victory, a surge of satisfaction running through him. That was five full tons! After taking a brief moment to savor his accomplishment, he turned to look at Myst, who was staring at him, her eyes wide in complete shock.\"Well done, traveler,\" stammered Myst after she recovered. \"You have set a new world strength record! The previous world record of greatest weight was held by Paul Edward Anderson who lifted 2,850 kilograms in a back lift. You have beaten his record by 175%. Would you like to record your name so future generations know what you have done?\"\"Hmm? Record my name? Is that like a leaderboard or something?\"\"Yes, traveler. We record the names of those who complete monumental tasks so that all might know of their might and glory.\"\"Oh.\" Xavier thought for a moment before shaking his head. \"Nah, I'd rather not. I'm playing this game to get out of the spotlight, not in it. The last thing I need is my name on a public list.\"\"Very well, traveler, I'll keep your name anonymous when we enter the new record.\"\"Thanks. Now, can you explain what is going on with these weights? Why are some so light compared to others? It feels like the weight disappears when I lift them up off the floor. Well, except for that one.\" Xavier said, his eyes resting on the various logs he had lifted.\"That is a great question, traveler.\" Myst took a deep breath. \"To understand the specifics of how strength and weight work in Nova Terra we must first examine the way strength and weight work in the real world. After all, Nova Terra is designed to mirror the real world without some of the inconveniences that exist in reality. This interaction can be understood with a simple example. Imagine we have two individuals. Both individuals are adults of average physical ability.\"The first person is equipped with metal armor, a sword, shield, and a pack of supplies. The gear he is currently wearing weighs approximately 25 kilograms. The second person is wearing light clothing. Each person begins to walk around a track. Given the extra weight that the first person is carrying, they will expend twice the amount of energy as the second, unencumbered person. \"Consider what would happen if they walk for two hours. Both will be tired, but the individual who has worn the armor will be more fatigued than his companion. Now, imagine that at the end of the two hours of walking, you asked them to each complete an obstacle course and participate in a life-threatening fight. It is obvious that the second individual will perform better than the first because they have more energy.\"During the early test of Nova Terra, players reported that even walking to task locations with all the equipment they needed to complete those tasks was too tiring. This resulted in an abysmal completion rate. The solution that we came up with was to implement the anti-burden feature. Nova Terra measures your weight and strength and drastically reduces the weight of items that fall below a specific threshold. This allows an average individual to carry approximately four times the normal amount of weight they could carry in the real world without experiencing the burden and fatigue that they normally would.\"Additionally, the weight of any items above that threshold are adjusted based on the strength of the individual and the amount of mastery they show in a particular area. Otherwise, there would be no way for a small or slight person to wield a greatsword or draw a non-composite bow. Since Nova Terra boasts the freedom to play as you want, we wanted smaller races not to be disadvantaged in this area.\"\"Huh, that makes sense, I guess,\" Xavier mused. \"It would be a drag to carry tons of weight around all the time. But, there is no way I would be able to pick up a ton outside of this game. Aren't you artificially boosting my strength? I thought the game didn't do that?\"\"That is a great question, traveler. Actually, I'm still processing why you are able to lift so much weight. While there are races that boost the strength of the player, no racial bonuses have been applied to you at this moment. Your strength is an approximation of reality based on physics, your size, quality and quantity of muscles, strength of tendons, bone density, and a number of other factors. All of which were entered via scan when you first entered.\" Looking as puzzled as Xavier, Myst clicked around her pad for a couple minutes before shaking her head.\"I see no anomalies in your scan. According to the data we have compiled, this is your approximate strength in a situation where your body has no prior damage. It is worth noting that your bones in the real world have millions of fractures and would not be able to support anywhere near this level of weight without shattering. But should you ever find yourself healthy, you would be able to exhibit this level of strength without issue.\"For a moment, silence reigned as Xavier tried to get his mind around what Myst was saying. So, if he was healthy in the real world, he would be able to lift five and a half tons? Did that mean that after he got out of the pod, he would have that level of strength? Unable to believe it, Xavier shook his head. Regardless, he wasn't even close to healthy, so it didn't matter one bit.\"Please browse the list of races available in Nova Terra while your scan is being completed,\" Myst said, breaking Xavier out of his thoughts.\"Aren't there more tests for me to do?\" Asked Xavier.\"I do not have any additional tests that would present you with a reasonable challenge, traveler. Your physical state is too far outside the anticipated values for any of the tests we have ready to be effective. Thus I am giving you the option to browse the races while we wait for your scores to be compiled.\"A large window filled with different races opened up in front of Xavier. Seeing that the six basic races were there as well as a button to scroll down, he started browsing all of the options. Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Halflings, Beastkin, and Demonkin made up the basic six races that occupied the world. Each had a racial advantage in the form of a proclivity to a subset of skills as well as a unique starting area. Further down the list were a number of Half races that would allow him to combine the various main races for a price. There were also new races like Seafolk, Feyfolk, Undead and many other fantasy creatures.Each race came with various strengths and weaknesses, though in all cases, they were small adjustments on the player's natural abilities. If you were a strong, fit person in real life, you might be slightly stronger by choosing a dwarf or slightly weaker if you chose an elf. But if you were overweight in real life, that would be reflected in your character in the game. That is why people were encouraged to work on themselves outside the game with regularity. After all, any advantage a person possessed in real life could be carried over to the game.And this was true for everything, not just level of fitness. Influence could be brought into the game through the recruitment of other players, money could be brought in through the massive cash shop and the city of Fantasia, and knowledge was applicable due to how closely the game resembled reality. As Xavier scanned the races, he began to realize that choosing a race was a key part in developing a character who could take advantage of the myriad possibilities the game presented, by leveraging the one thing that all players brought to the game equally - their individual playing style.", "A full ten minutes went by as Xavier browsed the list with no movement from Myst. Finally, she shivered and spoke to Xavier with an uncharacteristically flat tone. \"Your scan has been completed and your race choice has been assigned. Please select your race from the following list.\" The window in front of Xavier refreshed, and he couldn't help but blink at it. Gone were all the choices he had been browsing, and in their place a single entry stood by itself. Confused, Xavier looked for a scroll button. Unable to find one, he asked Myst where his choices were. In the same flat voice, Myst said, \"Your assigned race choice is displayed in the list. Please select your race.\"\"But there is only one race,\" protested Xavier.\"Your assigned race choice is displayed in the list. Please select your race,\" responded Myst.\"But what about the basic races! Don't I get to pick one of them?\"\"That is a great question, traveler. No. Due to the results of your physical scan, there are no available playable races that fit within the allowance for adjustments to an alternate reality body. Due to the psychological damage that could be done to you when experiencing the difference in dimensionality between your real body and your alternate reality body, you cannot be assigned any race currently playable by player characters. Due to this, the system has chosen a race from within the lore that matches your physiological characteristics and has made the necessary adjustments so you can play as this race. Your assigned race choice is displayed in the list. Please select your race.\"\"Wait, you made a race for me?\"\"That is a great question, traveler. No. We adjusted an existing NPC race so as to prevent the balance of the game from being broken and are allowing you and any other player who meets the requirements to play that race. Your assigned race choice is displayed in the list. Please select your race.\"\"Okay... I guess I'll choose my race from the list,\" Xavier said sarcastically as he looked more closely at the single race that had been made available for him.Titan. Even the name sent a twinge of disgust through him. He was playing this game in part to get away from the disadvantages of his massive size, and the game hadn't even started before he was reminded of it! And what was with locking him out of the other options? Sighing in frustration, Xavier decided to just get through the tutorial. The game representatives and the doctor would be hearing about this as soon as he got out, that was for sure.Clicking on the Titan, another screen popped up describing the race in more detail as well as displaying the various abilities of the race. \"Wait a second. This can't be right,\" Xavier said. \"How do I have the strength and endurance of a titan? I haven't even started playing!\"\"That is a great question, traveler.\" Myst stopped talking and stared at him.\"Uh. Something has to be wrong. May I talk to an administrator or something?\"\"That is a great question, traveler. There are no errors. Your body is anomalous, meaning that it deviates from what is standard, normal, or expected. As such, what is standard, normal, or expected cannot be used, and a new standard must be developed. Far from being at a disadvantage, you will likely find yourself the utter envy of all the other players. You are countless times stronger than even the strongest player, you have an excellent reaction time, and you have no noticeable mental impairment. Just because you are different and fall outside the norm does not mean there is something wrong.\" Myst fell silent again, continuing to stare.\"Argh! Fine!\" Hitting the 'accept race' button, a large mirror replaced the race screen, and Xavier was faced with an eight foot, nine-inch tall giant, complete with leather and fur clothing and a massive sword and shield. The only thing that separated the image from being the perfect example of a ferocious fantasy barbarian was that it was his own face that stared back at him.Selecting a couple options on the side, Xavier was able to see what he would look like in different types of medieval fantasy clothing, including wizard robes and a blacksmith's leathers. While not the most handsome, Xavier was passably good looking when his skin wasn't all stretched out, though his size was so shocking to most people that his looks rarely registered. Still, it was a bit strange for Xavier to see this version of himself. He had often avoided mirrors in the real world due to their frustrating reminder of his ugly situation. The rugged strength of the face before him was a welcome sight.Thoroughly annoyed at this whole process, Xavier tried to use the available slider to make himself as short as possible but was only able to reduce his height to 8' 5\", a measly 4\" below his regular height.\"Please be aware that no additional changes are available due to your avatar already being adjusted by 20%,\" Myst's flat voice commented. \"Would you like to accept these changes or reset your avatar?\" Grousing in his heart about the limits that Nova Terra put on changing one's self when creating a character, Xavier reset his character and tried modifying some of the giant's other features, only to find himself coming back to the maximum height setting.Looking over the powerful and imposing figure in front of him, Xavier mused that maybe it wasn't so bad to be tall. The fact that the game let him pick up a unique race went far toward mollifying his frustration, and it wasn't like being large was new to him. After all, he had spent his whole life towering over those around him. Actually, thinking more deeply about it, not being able to see over other people's heads would be quite strange. He set his height to his real-life height and added some barbaric looking tattoos across his left arm and chest.\"That doesn't look too bad,\" Xavier thought, accepting the changes. Instantly, the robotic body that currently housed him twisted and grew, the metallic skin tone softening and changing to a dark tan. His shoulders broadened, and his chest widened as his height shot up another foot, leaving him towering over Myst.Flexing his fingers and clenching his fist, Xavier could feel the power in them. Power that his hands in the real world lacked. There was a solidity about this body that his body in the real world didn't have, a weightiness as if this body was somehow more real. Jumping in place, Xavier felt no discomfort whatsoever. Instead, he felt strong and powerful, as though he could take on the world.\"Thank you, traveler. Due to your race selection, your starting location has been locked. When you arrive at your starting location, you will be prompted to select your name. Once you have entered the game you will encounter many different situations and challenges that will require you to use your wits and strength to overcome. There is much to discover in Nova Terra, including quests, specialized classes, and secret treasure. Please enjoy your stay in Nova Terra!\"As the world of white faded away, Xavier found himself in a small stone room with a magic circle in the center. Standing at the door was a guard who stepped forward with a clipboard and said in a nervous tone as he looked up at Xavier's towering bulk, \"Ho, traveler. Please write your name for the record.\"Mulling over his name choice for a moment, Xavier wrote \"Thorn\" in the available space. After receiving a small package that included five pieces of bread, each barely big enough for a single bite, five equally small water skins, and five copper coins, he ducked through the door and into a bustling medieval city complete with cobblestone streets. The long cobblestone street, easily two carts wide, stretched to his right and left, and the colorfully painted wooden buildings that rose on either side presented a charming picture. Hawkers called from their storefronts, trying to attract the attention of the crowds that raced by. Players, easy to spot by their determined movements toward their respective destinations mixed in with the slower, less deliberate townsfolk NPCs who went about their daily lives, unaware of the incongruity between the players and themselves.Xavier, no, Thorn, was astounded at how realistic everything was and could have been convinced it was reality if not for the box of text hovering in the middle of his vision. Dismissing it with a thought, he joined the flow of players. Despite standing a full two feet above the rest of the crowd, the players were far too preoccupied with their own tasks to pay attention to him. Plagued his whole life by the stares of others, a profound sense of relief swept over him as he looked around at the crowds hurrying by while paying him little to no attention.In fact, despite his height, there were many other players that stood out far more than Thorn, who was dressed in the simple beginner clothing. Fanciful armor covered a myriad of races streaming by, giving full testament to the claim that Nova Terra was a place of diversity. Graceful elves stalked down the road, brushing past human warriors in massive plate mail armor. Short but wide dwarves cut a determined path through the crowds while equally short halflings slipped through like tiny fish.Even more interesting were the odd Tigerkin that dotted the crowds or the Birdkin wheeling lazily overhead. Many of the more exotic races could not be seen, since they were more region specific. Demonkin were entirely missing from the city. From the research that he had done, it seemed that Humans and Demonkin formed the two main races of Nova Terra. Each race was part of an empire occupying approximately half of the continent.It was the friction between these two empires that formed the primary conflict in Nova Terra, with the other races allying themselves with the two main races. Berum, the city where Thorn had spawned, was in the north-west, far from the front lines of the Human and Demonkin conflict. The far north of Angoril was a frozen land of tundra, ice-covered mountains rising like dragon's teeth into the sky. Berum was located on a long chain of mountains that started in the far north, skirted the steppes and flowed all the way down to the Midlands along the western coast.Deep forests and tall mountains marked the landscape around Berum, and the local population consisted of hardy human pioneers and taciturn dwarves who preferred to stay in their mountain fortresses.After spending several minutes looking over the pop-ups that explained how to use his inventory and the limited number of other game features, Thorn decided to spend some time wandering around the city where he had started. Starting points in Nova Terra were based on a variety of factors and were divided into three different categories: rural, urban, and military. Anyone who spawned in a small town was considered to have a rural start while those who first spawned in a city had urban starts. Starting in a military fort was rare but had been known to happen, especially when the player had a military history in the real world.Surprisingly, Nova Terra was quite adept at identifying what a new player was familiar with and using that knowledge to ease them into this new world. There had been some hubbub when Nova Terra launched because people were concerned that the system was reading the player's memories, but Horizon's public demonstrations to the contrary put them at ease.Looking at his in-game map display, he saw the city he had arrived in, Berum, in the north-west of Angoril, the primary continent in Nova Terra. Even though the game had been out for a number of years, no one had managed to explore the entirety of Angoril, and many a guild was still focused on trying to map out the massive land. Angoril was roughly divided into eight sections, four in the north and four in the south.From what he had read about Nova Terra, it seemed that each of these sections was a duchy, ruled by an appointed duke. In the center of the northern half of the continent, residing in the floating city that graced the majority of the advertisements for the game, was the Imperial city where the Human Emperor held court. Mirroring this, the Demonkin capital was located in the center of the southern duchies. But, rather than floating, the Imperial city of the Demonkin occupied the inside of a massive pit.The southern and northern ends of the continent were temperate and had rotating seasons, but the four central duchies were closer to a tropical environment.Apart from the continent of Angoril, there were three smaller continents that had been introduced in various patches, and each had a different theme. Rasyn, off Angoril's eastern coast, was styled after Japan's Tokugawa period. To the north lay Gerund, a Viking themed location that housed numerous barbarian clans while to the south was Moa'techa, the Mayan themed empire. Each of the smaller continents was also dominated by a specific race.Thorn spent almost an hour walking around and taking in all the new sights and sounds of the city. It wasn't until he heard someone complaining about the rate of loot drops that he even remembered this was a game. The sights and smells were mesmerizing to someone who had been closeted his whole life. Brought out of his daze by the reminder, Thorn decided to check where he stood before he made a plan of action.\"Status.\" Titan's Strength and Titan's Endurance were excellent. Both were defensive abilities and complimented his massive innate strength. Extra resistance to anything was excellent as far as Thorn was concerned. After all, the more defenses the better.", "\"Uh, sir?\" a polite cough brought Thorn back to the present. Tugging gently on Thorn's sleeve was an intimidated city guard whose nervous companion was behind him, clutching a wooden nightstick.\"Yes?\"\"Um. Would you, uh, mind moving, uh, to the side of the street?\" stammered the guard, pointing to the side. \"You. Er. You're kind of blocking the traffic.\"\"Oh man, I am so sorry!\" Thorn exclaimed. He had been so engrossed in his status that he hadn't realized that he was standing in the middle of a street, a long queue of carts bunched up behind him. While they could have squeezed by, the sight of his 8' 9\" frame had scared the drivers enough that they called over a guard to deal with the giant.\"No, no,\" reassured the guard. \"It is no problem at all.\"Stepping to the side, Thorn took the opportunity to ask the guard some questions. \"I'm new to Berum and was a bit lost. Could you point me toward the town hall? I need to see someone for my starting quest.\"\"Uh, you are a traveler? Sheesh.\" Relieved, the guard put a hand to his chest. \"I thought you were one of those barbarian frost giants. You had me worried there for a minute.\"\"Frost giants?\"\"Yeah. They're huge like you, but people say they have terrible tempers. I heard one of them got mad and froze a whole city full of people. Everyone in the city, dead, just like that. Anyway, city hall? No problem.\"After getting directions, Thorn left the guards and made his way to the large building that dominated the center of the Public district. Berum was split into four main sections, each focused on a particular grouping of businesses.The North district was residential, and had the largest number of restaurants and businesses for entertainment. To the east of the city center was the Public district, where the majority of the business was conducted, based around city hall, while to the south was the Canal district, which was where all the goods going in and out of the city passed. The western part of Berum was called the Forge district, where the majority of businesses that had to do with crafting were located.City hall was a large, multi-story stone affair that gave the impression of a beehive as uniformed clerks ran around, this way and that. Players streamed in and out as well, eager to hand in their quests and get their rewards. Thorn made his way up the steps, ducking his head to pass through the door. Players instinctively moved around him, looking at him with curiosity. The guards, however, grew nervous as Thorn's shadow fell over them.Ignoring the guards who were readying their spears, Thorn passed by them into the spacious main hall, taking in the marble floors and pillars with glee. Thorn loved buildings that had enough space for him to stand. In fact, because of that, he had spent quite a bit of time studying architecture. He had always held the ambition of creating living spaces customized to his personal needs. A big smile on his face, he walked over to one of the secretaries who was staring at him wide-eyed.\"Hello, I'm Thorn. A new traveler. I was told I could get my first quest here?\"\"Uh, yeah.\" Spellbound, the secretary, a pretty brunette with a button nose and deep dimples had to look almost straight up to look Thorn in the eyes.With a chuckle, Thorn crouched, reveling in his freedom of movement. In the outside world, this simple movement would have ended with bloody cuts in his skin and lots of pain. Nova Terra was different and Thorn was free to move as he wanted. Crouching brought them almost eye to eye, a position much more comfortable for the secretary.\"You are big.\" Still stunned, the secretary couldn't seem to get past Thorn's size. She stared at the hand he had rested on the edge of her desk. It was easily twice the size of hers.\"I am,\" agreed Thorn, amused as always by the sheer unbelief on her face. \"So... about that quest?\"\"Hm, oh, right. Oh, I'm sorry, you surprised me,\" the secretary stammered, embarrassed by her staring. Straightening herself out, she launched into the standard announcement for the first quest. \"Welcome to Berum, traveler. Please hold for a moment while I scan you in. Once I've done that, I'll get you the opening quest.\" After agreeing to the quest, Thorn thanked the secretary and strolled out past the worried guards, giving them a friendly nod on his way. Before he had started the game, Thorn had been nervous about all of the social interactions that he was going to be forced into; after all, most of his life had been spent alone. Thankfully, his friendly and cheerful disposition seemed to serve him well, and, so far, it had not been an issue.Opening up his map display, Thorn realized that each of the places that the first quest had him going was in a different section of the city. Obviously, the point of the quest was to get him used to the area. Though, if he had known that, he wouldn't have spent two hours wandering around the town. His random stroll had taken him by all of the locations he needed to visit with the exception of the McCarthy Farm, which was located right outside the city.Retracing his steps, Thorn headed off to his first destination, the City Library. Located in the northern district near some of the upscale neighborhoods, the City Library looked similar to City Hall. Much of the architecture in Berum was similar, and the buildings, comprised of large stone blocks, gave a sense of longevity and stability. Unfortunately, Thorn still had to duck when going in.The library was split into three floors, with a large open courtyard in the middle, covered by a stained glass roof, creating a charming picture in the streaming sunlight. Players stood or sat in various library nooks, browsing through books they had taken off the shelves. Seeing that there was a central desk, Thorn headed that way, only to experience a repeat of his interaction with the secretary at City Hall.\"Hello, I'm a new traveler and this is my first time here at the library.\"\"Wow, you are big,\" said the wide-eyed elf after a brief moment of stunned staring.\"Uh, yeah. So, can I get a library card or something?\"\"Library card? Oh, right. Yes, yes.\" Pulling out some forms from underneath the desk, the librarian helped Thorn register himself, explaining the rules and regulations as he did so.\"You can borrow a single book at a time but only for a week at a time. Once that week is up, the book will automatically be returned to the library through the enchantment on the back. While at the library, you can read as many books as you would like, and if you want to return them, stack them on the return table. Make sure you don't leave anything in the books like bookmarks, as they will be returned with the book as well.\"The three different library floors each contain different sorts of books. On the bottom floor, you will find histories, biographies, and books about the different races. The second floor consists of crafting, job-specific, and how-to books. The third floor is comprised of an eclectic mix of various ancient tomes and books in other languages.\"If you are having any trouble finding a book, you can use the scrying stones located throughout the library to search by title, author, or subject.\" Pausing to scan the form that Thorn had completed, the librarian filed it away and then brought out a flyer. \"We also offer accredited classes through NTU. They can be taken here in Nova Terra or in Fantasia where we have a campus. If you are interested in a class or a full degree you can sign up here at the desk. We accept in-game currency or universal credits.\"\"I heard that degrees can transfer from the outside world, is that right?\" asked Thorn.\"Oh yes. So long as the program was accredited, you can apply any degree to receive an equivalent in-game title. Would you like to apply a degree now?\"\"No, I'm good for now,\" replied Thorn, looking around at all the books. Reading was one of his favorite things to do, but now was not the time for that. In this new world where he could move, he didn't want to spend his time cooped up inside.Leaving the library, Thorn headed for his next location, the Training Hall. It was located in the Forge District near a large collection of smoke-belching smithies. The Training Hall comprised of a large open parade ground and a large gymnasium-style building located next to the city barracks. Inside the parade ground, a large group of local NPCs were running through sword training while a couple travelers smacked furiously at some scarecrows.\"Ho, traveler, are you here to unlock your true potential?\" boomed a voice as Thorn entered the hall. Turning his head, he saw a man coming toward him dressed in a simple leather sleeveless shirt and brown pants. A large, thick metal studded belt with matching bracers and boots completed the classic look of the warrior trainer. \"I can teach you to be the best warrior this world has ever seen! As long as you can pay, of course.\" This last sentence was quite a bit quieter.\"Ah, you offer classes? What do they cost?\"\"Haha! Of course I do! Best warrior training this side of the East Empire's gladiator pits! The cost is 10 silver every three days for basic training, 50 silver for intermediate and 1 gold for advanced. You have to pay for a week at a time, and if you quit, I keep the money!\" The large man tried to look down on Thorn, a task made difficult by the fact that he was a good two feet shorter.\"If you are interested, step up, and I'll test you. This part is free,\" said the trainer, walking over to a clear spot in the yard. Everyone else stopped what they were doing and looked over. Hamm, the trainer, would regularly invite people up to \"train\" for a fee, and then beat them black and blue in the name of testing before sending them to practice their basics.\"Here, take this,\" Hamm tossed Thorn a practice sword while he readied his own. \"Now, I want you to attack.\"Holding the sword that looked more like a dagger in Thorn's massive hands, he swung it a couple of times before looking over at Hamm and moving toward him.\"Wait, wait! Not me, don't attack me!\" babbled Hamm while backing away from Thorn, his face white and his hands shaking. \"Attack that dummy, over there. Actually, attack that one.\" Hamm pointed to a training dummy farther down the line made of a strange black metal.Shrugging, Thorn turned to go over to the other dummy as Hamm gulped in relief. Just now, when Thorn had swung his sword through the air, his arm moved so fast it almost disappeared. Though not close, Hamm could still feel the shockwave the training sword made as it whipped through the air! He had no desire to get hit by that. Even if he blocked it, a strike with that much force would break his arm! How strong was this huge traveler anyway?Squaring up with the training dummy, Thorn concentrated. He had never used a real sword before, but he figured it was the same as the wooden practice swords he had used, right? The faster you swing, the more force should be generated. Taking a deep breath, Thorn twisted his waist and, drawing the sword behind his shoulder, swung hard at the training dummy's side. His sword blurred through the air and impacted into the side of the dummy with a boom, snapping the blade into pieces and breaking the dummy off its stand!Amidst the silence that blanketed the training hall, Hamm walked forward to examine the ruined dummy. The side of the metal reinforced body had been crushed in on itself as the force of the sword slammed into it. As far as he could tell, the cutting edge of the blade had been angled wrong and had not actually cut into the now-ruined dummy. Rather, Thorn had used brute force, crushing the dummy's splintered wooden side and bending the metal bands beyond repair.This strength was far beyond what any normal traveler should be able to generate, making Hamm extra thankful that he had not tried to receive the blow himself. He could only imagine what would have happened to him if Thorn had aimed that swing his way. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Thorn, who was examining the now busted training sword. He shivered at the thought of being on the receiving end of that swing. Aware that everyone in the building was watching him, anger overtook his embarrassment.\"I said attack it, not destroy it!\" blustered Hamm, only to be met with quizzical looks from everyone who was standing around watching. Realizing how stupid he sounded, he stomped over and yelled to hide his embarrassment, \"And what sort of warrior breaks their weapon like that? If you were surrounded by enemies and your sword broke, what would you do then?\"\"Ummm...I could...\"\"Yeah, that's what I thought!\" interrupted Hamm, tossing Thorn the other practice sword. \"Try again, but this time, no breaking the weapon!\" And so began one of the strangest training sessions in the history of Nova Terra. Next to a growing pile of broken practice swords, Hamm yelled and blustered, berating Thorn for swinging too hard and damaging his weapon.He yelled, \"Power is fine, and speed even better, but the warrior's most powerful advantage is based in control! Swing with speed, hit with power, but control your force, don't let it control you!\" Nearby, a couple of other native trainers stood watching, grins on their faces as Hamm got more and more frustrated at the inhumanly strong traveler who was making a mess of the training yard.", "\"Hey Hamm, didn't you say there wasn't a traveler you couldn't teach the sword to in a day? How is this one getting on?\" mocked one of the other trainers, earning a laugh from the others and a glare from Hamm.\"Shut it, Markus! He is coming along fine!\" snapped Hamm.His brow furrowing, Hamm stomped off, accompanied by the laughs of the other trainers. He returned a couple minutes later, dragging a massive box. With a grunt, he kicked it over, and a massive quantity of real swords in all shapes and sizes poured from the top.\"Markus is right, curse him. You are so strong you need something heavy enough that you can feel its weight to learn control. See if any of these work for you,\" Hamm said to Thorn, who began to root through the pile. There were short swords, long swords, bastard swords, broadswords, massive claymores and even a couple of naginata, but none of the swords felt heavy in Thorn's hands. He was so strong that even the heavy iron broadswords felt weightless to him.Shaking his head at Hamm, Thorn said, \"Sorry, none of these are any heavier than the practice swords.\"\"Well, you are going to have to get used to them. After all, pure force will only take you so far in a fight.\"\"Are you talking about softness?\"\"Softness?\" sneered Hamm, \"Why would you want to be soft? I'm talking about flexibility! You are strong, but using that strength all the time will fatigue you! You need to be able to relax your body and then apply your strength where you need it!\"\"Right, like softness transitioning to hardness. Explosive strength,\" nodded Thorn, oblivious to Hamm's growing rage. Thorn picked out the largest blade he could find, a massive great sword that was a full six feet long. Despite the fact that it was designed with fantasy in mind, it looked like a normal long sword. The blade was not as flexible as the Taijiquan swords he had practiced his forms with, but it would work for a demonstration.Holding the hilt in a reverse grip with his left hand, Thorn brought his hands together in a salute before sinking into the first stance. His countless hours of practice made the motion a natural one. Sinking into a horse stance, he shifted two steps to the front and then rotated into a bow stance, pushing his right hand out toward the front while blocking on his left side with his blade. Rotating his right wrist, he turned his body, cutting with the end of the blade and deflecting with his hand. As he continued his slow kata, he could hear the snorts of disdain from Hamm and the mocking chuckles from the others watching.Yet, as he continued the Taijiquan forms, the snorting lessened. The longer he watched Thorn's forms, the less ridiculous Hamm found them. Despite the slow speed and gentle motions, Hamm could tell that Thorn's absurd strength was waiting to burst forth. Imagining himself on the end of one of those excruciatingly slow stabs, Hamm couldn't help but feel himself breaking out in a sweat.Not everyone felt the same way, though. A large human warrior who had been looking on from the side spat on the ground. Hoisting his large sword to his shoulder, he walked in front of Thorn, forcing the giant to stop his kata.\"Oi, big boy. Anyone can pretend they know something about fighting, but real men fight!\" the big warrior bellowed, grinning. \"Or are you too scared for an actual fight?\"The brief nervousness that Thorn had felt when the man first walked up evaporated into excitement, and he looked at Hamm with a burning gaze. A chance to try actual combat with a body that worked? Thorn couldn't be more willing! In fact, his excitement was so palpable that the big warrior took a step back, caution floating through his mind.\"Is there a ring we could use to spar?\" Thorn asked Hamm, who pointed to a spot along the back wall where there was a square sparring ring.Walking over to the sparring ring, Thorn was about to step inside the lines when a prompt popped up in front of him. Accepting the prompt asking if he wanted to duel, Thorn stepped over the line and walked to one corner of the ring, excitement burning in his heart. While Thorn had never experienced actual combat before, he was quite familiar with blood and pain, so the thought of fighting with real swords held no fear for him. Besides, this was a game, right? No matter how realistic the experience, it wasn't like he was actually going to get injured.Seeing Thorn so excited, the big warrior was much less confident in himself. He had watched Thorn's slow moves in disdain, but Thorn's reaction to his challenge was unlike what he had envisioned. Normally the biggest guy around, Thorn's 8' 9\" height had made the warrior feel uncomfortable, and like most people who rely on their size to assert dominance, his solution was to try direct confrontation. But, despite Thorn's quiet, reserved, and respectful attitude, the giant seemed all too eager to take on his challenge.As the two squared up to each other, they presented a contrasting picture. The warrior stood at 6' 6\", 265 pounds of solid muscle. Studded leather armor covered his body, and a two-handed claymore hung from his back while a small metal shield rested on his belt. Numerous scars covered his arms; a small scar running across his left eyebrow gave him a dangerous look.Across from him, Thorn was simply massive. Standing more than two feet taller than the warrior he faced, Thorn was twice as wide in the shoulders. The beginner clothing that he was wearing only highlighted the massive muscles of his legs, arms, and chest. His hand engulfed the pommel of the greatsword like a kitchen knife , despite the fact that it was almost as large as his opponent. His face, though wide and rugged, had a certain peacefulness that seemed incongruous with the idea that he was about to engage in a bloody fight.Settling into his stance, Thorn's body exuded a relaxed air, as though he was resting while his opponent hopped up and down a couple times to get his muscles engaged. Hamm, who had followed them over, waved for the crowd to be quiet and checked to see if both players were ready. Getting the okay, he waved his hand.\"Start!\"With a low roar, the big warrior dashed forward, his claymore held in two hands. As he was about to reach Thorn's range, he jumped to Thorn's left and delivered a vicious cut with his blade! Caught off guard by the strong attack, Thorn froze for a moment before his instincts kicked in. Stepping back, Thorn's body seemed to collapse into itself, and the claymore slid past his chest with less than an inch to spare.Sensing the incoming follow up, Thorn reversed his energy, flowing back toward his opponent. Switching his sword to a reverse grip to guard against the backswing, his shoulder blasted forward toward his opponent's chest! The big warrior had landed from his sideways movement, and his sword extended to his left, putting him off balance as he tried to retreat. Despite the awkwardness of his position, the warrior was an experienced fighter and managed to draw his small shield and get it between Thorn's shoulder and his chest at the last second!With a loud thump, Thorn and the warrior collided, sending the large warrior stumbling backward. Not missing a beat, Thorn, who had not shifted from the impact, stepped forward. Switching from a reverse grip to a forward grip, he thrust his sword out so fast the blade seemed to disappear.Desperately warding off the strike with his buckler, the big warrior continued moving backward, unable to catch his balance. Each successive stab put extreme pressure on him. Just when he thought he would be able to get his feet under him, Thorn pivoted, whipping a massive leg out in a sweep!Unable to dodge in time, the big warrior hit the ground with a bone-jarring slam. Stunned by the fall, he could do nothing but watch as Thorn transitioned right back into a stab, planting his blade right next to the warrior's throat!\"I give up!\" squeaked the warrior. His face was pale as he stared with horrified eyes at the blade that had sunk into the stone floor.Grinning, Thorn suppressed a shout of excitement. Leaving his sword stuck in the floor, he picked up the big warrior and put him on his feet, dusting him off.\"Thanks for the fight! I'm Thorn, what's your name?\"\"Uh...Bi...Big M..Mac. Mac. You can call me Mac.\"\"Nice to meet you, Mac. Thanks for sparring with me. Want to try again?\"\"No, no, I'm all good,\" said Big Mac, backing up. \"I better rest.\"\"No problem,\" said Thorn, pulling his sword out of the ground. \"Let me know if you want to try again!\"Watching the terrified warrior leave the ring, Hamm shook his head. Thorn's moves were smooth, powerful, and well practiced, but it was evident that he was woefully short on actual combat experience. Stepping into the ring, Hamm coughed to get Thorn's attention.\"Hmph. Do you still want someone to spar with, kid?\"\"Yes, sir! If you are available.\"\"It's been a while since I last fought, so pardon me if I'm a bit rusty,\" said Hamm, pulling out a saber and shield from nowhere and doing a quick stretch.Off to the side, the other trainers rolled their eyes at this line, muttering, \"Been a while? Then why did you come back yesterday covered in bandit blood?\"This time Thorn made the first move, stepping forward and striking down with an overhead chop. Hamm deflected the blow smoothly while closing the distance and striking with his saber at Thorn's right foot, forcing him to step back. Hamm continued to advance, stepping inside Thorn's range, making it difficult for the giant to swing his large sword. Unable to create space, Thorn tried to force Hamm back with a body check. Nonplussed, Hamm blocked the blow with his shield, using the deflected force to spin around behind Thorn and deliver a slash to his hamstring.The sharp, stinging pain told Thorn that he was in a lot of trouble if he didn't get away, so he slid one of his legs back and rotated his torso, striking with his arm. Because he was so close, Hamm wasn't able to dodge the blow and flew backward. Rolling out of the fall, Hamm bounced to his feet and dashed back toward Thorn, saber swinging.Trading blows back and forth, it became clear that Hamm was much more skilled than Thorn. Within minutes, Thorn's body was covered in bloody gashes from the saber. Watching the scene, the crowd winced every time Hamm added a new cut to his massive opponent. Despite the cuts, Thorn was having a great time. The cuts were painful but looked much worse than they actually felt. Thanks to the pain reduction that Nova Terra employed, they felt much more like an insect bite than an actual cut, allowing Thorn to ignore them.Hamm, however, was getting frustrated. Most of the time players would give up once he showed them how much better he was, but Thorn seemed to be indomitable. Finally, fed up with Thorn's lack of awareness, Hamm's form blurred. Dashing forward, he slid passed Thorn's guard, his saber coming to rest on Thorn's neck.Stepping back and admitting defeat, Thorn grinned at the sword trainer. Clasping his hands together, he bowed to show his respect as he would when he trained with his sifu, Ms. Chen.\"Thank you for your instruction.\"\"You are a pretty incredible first-timer,\" Hamm said, shaking his head. \"You're a machine. Where'd you learn those moves?\"\"My master taught me. It is called Taijiquan straight sword, or Jian. Taijiquan is a primarily barehanded system of martial arts that also uses saber, sword, and spear.\"\"Well, it has a pretty strong base,\" admitted Hamm, wiping the sweat from his forehead. \"But it is quite apparent that you do not have much experience actually fighting. Unfortunately, that means that we don't have much for you here.\" Taking a moment to gesture toward the other trainers, he continued. \"Most of what we do is teaching new travelers how to fight in the first place. That means teaching them the basic forms of fighting. Most travelers come to this world with fear and a major aversion to violence. Our job is to break them of it and instruct them in the basic way of using various weapons. You don't fit that bill, since you already have those basics pretty much mastered.\"\"Oi, Hamm!\" A dwarf clutching a pipe in his teeth pushed his way through the crowd, his meaty hand tucked into his broad leather belt. \"You may not have anything to teach him, but that doesn't mean I don't!\"\"This is Dovon. He teaches grappling,\" Hamm said with a sigh.\"M'boy, I saw your match! Quite impressive it was, too. But what do ya do when you are without a sword, eh? I can train you up so that all them muscles won't be for show, eh? Look at these tendons, Hamm, perfect for a grappler, and those knuckles! Exactly what ya need for a solid punch. Boy, you're with me now, I won't take no for an answer!\" Stepping forward, Dovon latched onto Thorn's wrist and tried to pull him away from the ring but found himself unable to move Thorn even an inch.Rather than becoming dispirited, Dovon grabbed one of Thorn's hands, examining it. After a long moment, he moved to the other hand and then to Thorn's arms and legs.\"Holy Terra, boy. I take back what I said. These muscles are not for show at all. What on earth did your mom feed you to turn you into such a monster? Eh, doesn't matter. Come on, come on, I'm going to show you how real men fight.\" But before he could pull Thorn away, a slim elf maid stepped in front of him, a knife dancing through her fingers.\u00a0", "\"Dovon, leave him be. He already knows how close combat works. He needs more experience, like Hamm said. What he needs are long-range attacks,\" said the elf maid with an evil smile. \"And that is my purview.\"\"Back off, leaf head,\" growled the dwarf, cracking his knuckles.\"No, you back off, shorty,\" said the elf, in no way intimidated. Her eyes narrowed. \"Or how about I tell your missus where you were this past Tuesday?\"Face blanching, Dovon dropped his hands and put on his best smile, immediately stepping out of the elf's way.\"Anyone else fancy themselves this boy's teacher?\" Seeing that none of the other trainers stepped up to challenge her, the elf chuckled. \"Hello, Thorn, I am Janus Fairgoode. I specialize in projectiles. Mostly bows, but I do dabble in other thrown weapons, as well. If it's made for fighting at a distance and isn't magic, then I'm your gal. I teach lessons at the same price as Hamm.\"\"Thanks, but I don't actually have money to pay for lessons. I only started playing today, so I stopped by to check things out and complete my starter quest,\" said Thorn.Ignoring dumbfounded expressions on the crowd's faces, Thorn waved goodbye and strode quickly away. Down the street, he suddenly realized the sword that Hamm had lent him was still in his hand. He turned around to return it, but when he got close to the door, he could hear Janus' high pitched voice yelling, so he decided to return it later.It wasn't marked as a stolen item, so he stuck it in his inventory. Nova Terra's inventory system worked much like inventories worked in other games. It was a subspace where the character could store almost anything that they possessed. Checking his quest, he saw that he still needed to go to Edgar's Emporium and the McCarthy Farm. Edgar's Emporium was in the southern district, also known as the Market District, where the majority of the trade goods came into the city. A large shop, Edgar's Emporium sold everything an adventurer could need. However, five copper coins weren't enough to buy much of anything, so Thorn didn't stay long. The currency of Nova Terra was pretty simple, with ten copper making up a silver, one hundred silver making up a gold, and one thousand gold making up a platinum. UCs or Universal Credits, the currency of the real world, were also usable, but the exchange rate fluctuated based on how many people were trying to buy gold.That left only the McCarthy Farm. McCarthy Farm was outside the city to the south-west, sprawling over rolling hills. At the entrance to the farm, an NPC was handing out a quest to kill some rats that had been raiding the farm's fields. After accepting it, Thorn walked over to the nearby fields only to stop and stare in amazement.Players were dashing this way and that, each trying to land a killing blow on the pests as soon as they spawned. No sooner had a rodent appeared than a mass of players would surge toward it. Shrieking and hooting, they tried to land a blow on it before the unfortunate creature vanished back into the code. Shouts of \"kill stealer\" and loud swearing were everywhere. Unsure of what to do, Thorn stood in place. He was so engrossed in this new scene that he barely felt it when someone ran straight into him and tumbled to the ground.\"Oh, excuse me,\" said Thorn, instinctively concerned for the girl who had landed on the ground. \"No, no, my fault. Haha, I should be watching where I'm going!\" said the redheaded girl, scrambling to pick up her witch's hat before she jumped up and dashed off again.Bemused, Thorn could only watch as she sped off. With a shake of his head, he backed up and started walking out of the yard, trying to find a quiet place to kill vermin in peace. His wandering took him out of the fields where new players were slaying creatures and into a nearby forest.Due to his physical condition, Thorn rarely left his house during his 16 years of life except to go to the hospital, so he quite enjoyed the cool quiet of the forest. Winding his way aimlessly through the trees, he cast his mind over what he knew about the game.Nova Terra was a unique game that bragged it was more of an alternate reality than an actual game. This is why stats were hidden and the game required you to actually complete tasks to improve your skills. When he had first heard about entering the game as a form of treatment, Thorn had become excited about the idea of being able to move as he wished. He was especially excited about being able to put his martial arts training into practice. He had played turn-based strategy and management games, as they did not need the quick movements that Real Time Strategy games and Shooters did.But, compared to most sixteen-year-olds, Thorn was way behind when it came to familiarity with games. Then again, he was way ahead when it came to maturity. This stood him in good stead since Nova Terra was less of a game and more of an alternate reality. Plus, the idea that he could fall back on his aunt if he found himself floundering was always in the back of his head.While Nova Terra wasn't a pay to win game, there was no denying that money and influence could give you a definite edge. The shop sold all sorts of items that could give a player an edge, and players who had the cash to spend benefited from it. Thorn was not lacking in that department, though he had not yet decided how he felt about spending money on a reality that wasn't ultimately real. Besides, there was something quite romantic about the idea of forging your own way, setting your own destiny and pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. With his only experience fighting being the two matches that he participated in at the training hall, Thorn was looking forward to practicing in the game. Thorn, cautious by both nature and experience, recognized that he needed to learn in actual combat. A normal fight was not like a fight in the ring, where his wounds healed after it ended.Stopping in a little clear area in the woods, Thorn settled into a horse stance and completed a few of his forms. He had always focused on very slow and steady movements, infusing strength through gentleness and control. But his body was different in Nova Terra, and with mounting excitement, Thorn began to inject more and more strength into each move. He moved faster and faster until his hands and feet were snapping through the air. Ecstatic at the feeling of moving his body freely, Thorn let loose, stepping, turning and bursting with power. Slow to fast, smoothly transferring his weight and energy. His master, Ms. Chen, had talked a lot about Fa Jin, the energy bursting principle of Taijiquan, but Thorn had never been able to practice it himself. Instead, he had often spent hours in meditation, visualizing himself moving through his techniques, focusing power into his strikes by coordinating his whole body's movement. Engrossed in his practice, time sped by, and before he knew it, the sun was starting to set, and his stomach was starting to rumble. He sat down where he was, and pulled out one of his loaves of bread. The loaf, a reasonable size for an adult, looked tiny in his hand. With a shrug, he ate it in two bites, grumbling as he pulled out another one. Munching on the other loaf, he looked around at the trees and the soft sunlight filtering through the leaves. It was quite beautiful in this new world, and Thorn couldn't help breaking out into a huge grin.Life was looking up. His usual routine had smashed wide open and adventure was on the horizon. Gone was his life of watching the world pass from his chair. He took a deep breath, drinking in the clean, crisp evening air. For the first time ever, he didn't have to worry that a sudden movement would have him bleeding all over. He could finally relax and enjoy the moment. Darkness arrived, blanketing the world in a deep blue, pierced by the bright yellow of the moon. While the light from the moon was more than bright enough for Thorn to make his way through the forest, the trees' long, dark shadows stretched into each other, creating a sinister atmosphere. Though shocked at how drastically the feeling of the forest changed with the coming of night, Thorn was not particularly worried. Feeling smug, he toggled his map display and retraced his steps toward the McCarthy Farm.Arriving at the rolling hills and green fields that marked the edge of the forest, Thorn saw that the fields were as full as before. Players were doing their very best to find the randomly spawning pests for their quest. Shrugging to himself, Thorn walked out and joined the throng.Finding a spot in the crowd was easy, and Thorn's size worked to his advantage. Space quickly cleared around him, especially once he pulled out his sword. With the six-foot sword, Thorn had an almost ten-foot reach. A few practice swings emptied out his surroundings as other players backed up to avoid the whistling blade.Dealing with the pests turned out to be much more difficult than Thorn anticipated. Each time a pest would spawn, the closest players would swarm over to try and kill it to get credit for the quest. The real dangers, however, were the players farther away who would shoot arrows or throw projectiles, resulting in the area around each spawning pest turning into a pincushion. Finally, after almost three hours of frustration and not managing to get a single kill, Thorn had had enough and squatted down. Extending his large sword, he began to sweep it across his side, a few inches above ground level. Switching hands without stopping, he continued to sweep his sword back and forth, the hum of the sword cutting through the air, creating a deadly reminder to the nearby players to stay away.After two minutes, a pest popped out of the ground, only to get bisected! Not even bothering to pick up the body, Thorn continued his swings uninterrupted. Nodding to himself in satisfaction, he checked his quest mentally, happy to see his kill count increasing. This method generated the ten pest kills he needed after a few minutes, and he stood up, stretched, and went about gathering the bodies of the rodents.Tossing them into his inventory, Thorn walked back to the edge of the farm where he had gotten the quest. The NPC quest giver was not at his usual post, leaving Thorn confused. Seeing Thorn looking around, a friendly player informed him that the NPC was sleeping and wouldn't be out till the next day.\"Huh, I guess that makes sense,\" Thorn thought to himself. \"If this is an alternate reality, it would be strange to assume that the NPCs were going to stand around in the same spot waiting for players. Does this mean that all the NPCs have their own lives?\"Looking around, Thorn decided to try and find a place to sleep for a bit. While the farm wasn't far from Berum, Thorn wasn't interested in going back to the town and trying to find an inn for one simple reason. What sort of inn would have a bed that was more than 8' 9\" long? His bed in real life was a custom-made monstrosity that could fit a full family of five, but Thorn could not imagine he would be that lucky here in Nova Terra.The number of players that were out and about had in no way decreased, causing Thorn to wonder what was going on. Pulling up his in-game browser, Thorn searched for information on sleeping in Nova Terra.The result surprised him. Despite the time dilation, players often had to sleep in a semi-regular schedule in-game. This was due to the mental energy that the players were exerting during each in-game day. A player's mental energy expenditure would increase based on how tense their situation was. This meant that a player out in the wilderness fighting monsters might need to sleep every night while those who stayed in the safe cities might only need to sleep once a week. Players could sleep in Nova Terra, but many players would sleep when they logged out, setting up their schedule so that they were in Nova Terra for five game days, and out for two. An interesting side effect of this was that the players who spent their time producing were able to keep up with the production demands of the adventurers who often had to spend a third of their game days sleeping.Still, that did not help Thorn's current predicament, which was where to put his head down to rest. Looking around for a dark corner, Thorn found a spot by the barn and sat down. Leaning back against the wall, he instinctively began the breathing exercise that his master had taught him. It helped him calm down and manage his pain. For years, sleeping had been more of a chore than a pleasure as lying down only increased the pressure on his chest and lungs.Concentrating on his spirit, he touched his tongue to the roof of his mouth and began to exhale in a long, continuous breath, pushing the air from his diaphragm. As he fell into the rhythm and felt his body begin to relax, Thorn wondered if the Chi that his master always talked about was real in Nova Terra.As a fantasy setting full of fantastical creatures and ancient mysteries, Nova Terra teemed with things that would be pure myth in the real world. Even magic, a difficult and esoteric subject, had popped up in the last few years, causing fledgling mages to begin to spring up like weeds. While doing his research, Thorn had considered trying to learn magic but decided that it was not for him. Spells, while powerful, were a total pain to cast and even more of a pain to learn. According to the little that he had read, every spell had multiple pieces that all had to be in order for the spell to work. Not only did spells require a deep understanding of the verbal command that triggered them, but also the accompanying hand gestures and sometimes physical reagents. All this seemed like too much trouble when Thorn could hit things with his sword.Thinking of hitting things with his sword, Thorn reflected over the two fights he had experienced earlier in the day. The first fight had fit his expectation pretty well. Despite Mac's experience, Thorn's training had proven better, and he was able to win. However, the fight against Hamm had been very frustrating. Hamm's movements were precise and seemed to anticipate Thorn's every move. In fact, he had not been able to touch him with his sword no matter how he swung it. Resolving to practice more, Thorn drifted off to sleep.\u00a0", "It was early morning when he woke up. Eating the rest of his bread, he waited for the farmer who had given him the quest to appear. Turning in the quest was simple, and Thorn collected the ten copper coins the farmer was offering for the pest corpses and walked back to Berum. The line at the gate wasn't long. Apart from some nervous looks from the guards, he got into the city without issue. Heading back to the eastern district, Thorn turned in his quest at City Hall. Seeing his somewhat lost look, the secretary recommended that he go to the job board and look for some tasks to get himself started. Thorn, who had been wondering what to do next, thanked her and hurried off to see what other sorts of things the game had for him.Quests in Nova Terra were different than quests in other games in that there was no physical indicator that an NPC had a quest to give. With no yellow exclamation points or question marks floating above the NPCs' heads to tell Thorn that there was something special to do, he had been a bit lost as to how to find something to do. The job board settled that.Located outside of City Hall, the job board displayed quests issued by the NPCs of the city. It also showed tasks that players submitted to have other players complete for a fee. This worked out well for everyone because Nova Terra did not have experience points. Functionally, there was no difference between a task issued by a player and a task issued by an NPC. Not only was the board a place for tasks, but it was also a recruitment board. This allowed guilds, mercenary corps, and other groups to advertise and recruit players to work with them.Looking over the board, Thorn found a task that suited him. The surrounding forests were being plagued by a large pack of corrupted wolves, and the city had offered a bounty on them. They were paying three copper per tail turned in. Pleased that there was no limit to the number of tails that could be submitted, Thorn headed for the forest after spending his 10 coppers on more bread.He had never hunted anything before, so he had to rely on walking around some of the areas mentioned in the task on the job board. Thorn spent almost an entire morning wandering this way and that through the forest, looking around for some wolves. Unable to catch sight of even a single wolf, Thorn sat down to eat lunch while he considered his next move. At this rate, he would starve to death before he found his first wolf.Opening the in-game browser, Thorn looked for information on finding wolves. There was quite a bit of information on hunting in general, and Thorn spent an enjoyable hour reading through some of it. Bookmarking a couple of pages for later reading, Thorn finally found a forum post that mentioned that the wolves around Berum were farther out in the forest than the task said. Looking at the area on the map that the post mentioned, Thorn confirmed he had not yet walked through that area.Standing up and dusting his pants off, Thorn moved in that direction. The forest was nice, but the constant ducking to avoid the low hanging branches was getting old. So, though Thorn was still excited to get some wolves, he decided to find somewhere else to walk around. The journey wasn't too long, and Thorn arrived at the edge of the marked space within an hour.According to the forum posts, the corrupted wolves had been around for a while and the task that the city issued had been a pretty consistent task. To the north-west of the city, north of McCarthy Farm, was a large stand of old growth forest tucked between three large mountains. This forest was the home of the corrupted wolves; from there they spread to the north and west of the city.There wasn't any information on where the wolves came from or how they had been corrupted, but the post had mentioned the way to differentiate a corrupted wolf from a normal wolf. Corrupted creatures, as a rule, had extended claws and fangs and red glowing eyes. Many also had streaks of black running through their fur that increased with their level of corruption. The main feature of corrupted creatures was a complete fearlessness and a deep bloodlust that would cause them to attack with abandon as soon as they discovered prey. While this made them very hard to fight, they didn't have to be chased down like normal wolves. As he moved forward, Thorn began to see the trees thinning out and the undergrowth disappearing. After a while, he noticed that the trees were bigger, and he had much less trouble walking under them. The forest floor here was covered in a spongy layer of composting leaves and debris from the trees, fine blades of grass poking up wherever beams of light were able to pierce the thick foliage. Thorn was walking around a large boulder when his scalp prickled, and a dark shape came barreling at him from the side. Instinctively raising his right shoulder, Thorn felt a sharp pain as a corrupted wolf's teeth ripped into his skin, forcing him to stumble backward.Still reeling in shock from the ambush, Thorn reached out, his immense hand curling around the corrupted wolf's chest. With a grunt, he heaved the wolf off and scrambled backward until his back was against the boulder. Three corrupted wolves appeared, low growls issuing from their throats, and began circling him, looking for a weakness. Checking his shoulder, Thorn was relieved to see that it wasn't bleeding too badly. Still, he could feel his health trickling away, so he couldn't afford to wait too long. Seeing him look down at his shoulder, the wolf on his left howled and dashed forward, its claws flashing. This time, ready for the attack, Thorn pulled his sword out with his right hand while shifting his weight onto his right foot and snapping a sidekick at the wolf as it jumped. Feeling his foot connect, Thorn borrowed the rebounding force to drop into a squat before shifting forward into a bow stance as he cut upwards with his blade, bisecting the wolf in front of him while dodging the snapping teeth of the wolf attacking from the right.Without even looking, he reversed his swing and lopped off the attacking wolf's head with a neat slash. Turning to face his left again, Thorn's mouth dropped open. The first wolf to attack was also dead, its head crushed by his snap kick! Releasing a big breath, Thorn patted his chest. Real combat was nerve-wracking!Collecting the tails of the three wolves to turn in for the quest, Thorn rested for some minutes before continuing forward. The attack had come out of nowhere; Thorn's perception wasn't strong enough to spot the hiding wolves, so he wasn't sure what else he could have done. He had heard people talk about being able to sense killing intent, but Thorn had grown up in the most peaceful environment possible, so he didn't even know what killing intent would feel like.In fact, the countless hours that Ms. Chen spent forcing him to complete his slow Taijiquan moves and the fact that this was a game were the only reasons he could fight at all. Despite how lifelike the game was, Thorn was not able to suspend his disbelief completely, giving him something of a laissez-faire attitude when it came to things like getting hurt. This allowed him to be completely fearless when facing his opponents.Advancing, Thorn had more warning before his next fight. He caught sight of another three wolves coming over a hill. Three bloody minutes later, he had earned three more tails and a nasty bite on his leg. Fortunately for him, in Nova Terra health regeneration was closer to a game than to real life, otherwise, Thorn would have been in a lot of trouble as the wounds built up.After resting for a couple moments outside of combat, all of his wounds began to knit themselves back together, taking only a few minutes to heal completely. Emboldened by his two encounters, Thorn decided to speed up a bit and, covering vast amounts of ground with his enormous stride, ran into six more groups of wolves before dusk began to settle. Knowing that the thick layer of foliage would make the forest completely dark soon, Thorn decided to call it a day and head back for town. After about forty-five minutes of walking, he made it back to Berum, picking up another three tails on the way. Over the course of the day, he had collected 27 tails, which, at 3 coppers each, came to eight silver and 1 copper. After a guard pointed him to a cheap inn, Thorn bought some dinner and went to bed. Even though he could stay up for a couple days in a row due to the time dilation, Thorn was not in any rush. After all, he had the next 14 years to do quests.The inn was somewhat run down, but since cheap was currently the name of the game, Thorn did not care. He paid the gawking tavern owner and squeezed up the stairs to the small room he had rented. Like he had dreaded, the bed was a small single. Stripping the sheets off of it, Thorn lowered himself onto the groaning floor. Worried that the floor was going to collapse under him, he stayed as still as he could. Running through his breathing technique, more out of habit than anything else, he soon fell asleep.At some point in the night, feeling a cold breeze, Thorn woke up. Sensing something wrong, he lay still, his eyes barely open. It took him a moment, but he made out a small figure crouched in front of the window. Dressed completely in black with a mask over its face, the figure seemed to have just come in through the slightly open window.Reaching around in the dark, Thorn grabbed the first thing that his hand fell on. As the figure stood and snuck toward the window, Thorn hurled it at the thief!Oberlin Danihoff, III, had been out of luck recently. Starting with that twelve-year-old kid from whom he'd tried to lift a magical tome. That kid had turned out to be an archmage of some sort, specializing in lightning. And to make a bad thing worse, the magical tome had almost eaten one of his fingers! Then it was the madman with the portal in his room who summoned some sort of eldritch horror. Ugh. He had been washing slime out of his hair for weeks. Needless to say, his often impeccable luck had recently been complete garbage. It was so bad, in fact, that he, the greatest thief in all of Angoril, had been reduced to scrounging for coins in a dump of an inn in the middle of bloody nowhere. Shaking his head in frustration, he continued to move forward slowly until a cold breeze blew across his back.\"I thought I latched that!\" he thought, swearing to himself. A quick glance at the bed showed that it was still empty, but Oberlin was a professional, so he turned to close the window. When he got to it, he realized the latch was actually broken, explaining why it had swung open behind him. As he began to re-affix the latch, he heard a heavy creak behind him and turned his head in time to see the entire bed flying across the room at him, a gargantuan shadow monster that filled the room rising up behind it!With an ear piercing scream, Oberlin dove through the window in an attempt to avoid the bed hurtling toward him, all the while cursing every god he could think of.Startled by the loud commotion, the inn's owner rushed out from the back, his nightgown askew, clutching a comically large axe. Thorn pulled the bed out from the hole he had created and looked down. The bed frame had smashed out some of the wall next to the window, allowing Thorn to squeeze his bulk out of the hole and drop to the ground next to the thief, who was on his back groaning after falling 15 feet.Landing with a thump, Thorn watched the unresisting thief, who was muttering something about quitting this stupid game while he waited for the innkeeper to come out. The commotion, resulting from the loud smash as the bed frame impacted the wall moments after the thief dove out the window, seemed to have roused the whole inn. Still fuzzy, Thorn was unsure of how to proceed. Before he could decide if he should find a guard or take the thief to jail himself, the innkeeper rushed out the door of the inn, his giant axe waving around him in the air. The innkeeper looked around wildly, and, upon spotting the gaping hole in his wall on the second story, let out a furious shriek!\"WHO SMASHED A HOLE IN MY WALL?!\"\"Um, that was me,\" Thorn admitted, raising a hand.\"HOW ABOUT I SMASH A HOLE IN YOU?!\" Apoplectic, the innkeeper tried to grab Thorn by the collar, but, due to the difference in height, he only managed to grab Thorn's shirt near his ribs. \"YOU....you....\" realizing that he was currently threatening someone twice his size who, moments before, put a massive hole in the wall, the innkeeper trailed off, deflating.\"Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I didn't realize I had grabbed the bed,\" said Thorn, rubbing his nose. \"I was trying to scare off this thief.\"\"Well I'd say you succeeded,\" muttered Oberlin to himself, trying to push off the ground.", "Seeing him trying to stand, Thorn grabbed Oberlin and picked him up. Setting him on his feet, he left his massive hand resting on the thief's shoulder, his fingers ready to squeeze should the thief try and make a run for it. Surprisingly, Oberlin made no attempt to free himself, seeming completely resigned to his fate.The innkeeper, too scared to continue yelling at his giant customer, ran to the end of the street to get a city guard. While he was leaving, Oberlin looked up at the mammoth figure holding onto him and grimaced.\"Greetings, my good man. Given the dubious nature of this initial meeting, why don't we start over? I'm Oberlin Danihoff the third, last in a long line of professional swipers. Being that we are both of the non-digital variety, and you haven't lost anything, do you think you could do a chap a favor and let me scoot before the constabulary show?\" Oberlin looked at Thorn with a hopeful gaze.It took Thorn almost a full minute to understand what the slim thief was saying, but once he got it, he couldn't help but chuckle. Shaking his head, he continued to hold the thief, impervious to his babbling until the guards arrived. Once he saw the guards, Oberlin gave an explosive sigh, looking up at the sky.Rejecting the guard's offer of having Oberlin give him compensation, Thorn expressed his desire to go back to sleep, so the guards dragged the depressed thief away with them. Over to the side, the innkeeper was staring in despair at the hole in his wall. He had been tempted to raise a fuss so that Thorn would pay for the repairs but had abandoned that plan as soon as he saw the giant.As for Thorn? He yawned, and stretching out an arm, he grabbed the exposed floor of his second-story room, pulling himself back up to squeeze through the hole. Fluffing the small pillow he had been using, he lay back down on the floor of the room and was soon fast asleep. Gulping, the innkeeper swore to himself that he wouldn't be involved with this freak!\"Who climbs into a second story without jumping? Wait! Forget jumping, who does it at all?\" he thought, dragging his axe back into the inn.Thorn woke up early to bright morning light streaming through the hole he had made. Examining the damage, Thorn could see that the walls were made of plaster-reinforced wood with wooden frames around the windows. The plaster on the inside of the wall had been pulverized, and the exposed wood had been splintered beyond recognition.After taking a good look at what was needed to fix the problem, Thorn made his way downstairs to the dining room. A quick look around confirmed that none of the rather spindly chairs would be able to hold his weight, so Thorn took a seat on the floor and waved over one of the staring waitresses.\"Morning, do you sell breakfast?\"\"Yes sir,\" she replied, pulling out a menu for him. \"It's two copper for the standard breakfast, which is two eggs, breakfast potatoes, toast, and juice.\"\"Excellent, I'll have six.\" Thorn handed the menu back. \"You can scramble the eggs.\"\"Six, sir? Six eggs?\"\"No, six of the standard breakfasts. That would be 12 eggs. Plus all the other stuff.\"\"Y...Yes sir,\" replied the waitress. Bemused, she walked into the back, returning five minutes later with a massive tray with three breakfasts stacked on it. Letting Thorn know that the rest of the food would be coming, she hurried away.Thorn, excited to be eating something other than bread, devoured the potatoes first, before putting the eggs on the toast. Each piece of toast was polished off in two bites, and the rest of the eggs were inhaled, as well. Thorn was enjoying his juice, the plates in front of him empty when the waitress came out to deliver the second set of food. At the sight of the empty plates, the waitress almost dropped her large tray in shock. This time she stayed in the dining room and watched in awe as Thorn shoveled the new food into his mouth as fast as the last.Paying for his meal, Thorn heaved himself off the floor and went in search of the innkeeper. He found him outside talking to a dwarf with a thick leather apron. Thorn apologized again, and after some discussion, convinced him to not only let Thorn pay for the repairs but to also rebuild the bed in that room into something that would fit Thorn's massive size.That left Thorn with almost no money. So, after getting a few supplies and some food for lunch, Thorn readied his sword and headed back out to the old-growth forest where he had encountered the corrupted wolves. Arriving without issue, Thorn ventured deeper into the forest.The corrupted wolves seemed to travel in packs of three, which made them hard for a normal individual to hunt. At the same time, the low price per tail made the bounty unattractive for groups who would have to split the profits. Thorn, however, was not normal. His martial arts training, coupled with his size, made it easier for him to hunt. By lunchtime, he had a tidy pile of tails.Noticing that the deeper he went into the forest, the greater the frequency of his encounters with the corrupted wolves, Thorn did his best to range around the outskirts of the forest while keeping a sharp lookout to make sure he did not encounter multiple groups of corrupted wolves at the same time. While he could deal with three wolves at once, he could not do so without injury. Adding another three wolves was beyond what Thorn could handle at the moment.The next few days passed in a familiar routine. During the day, he would hunt corrupted wolves around the edge of the old-growth forest. When evening came, he would make his way back to the city to turn in the quest. Seeing how willing Thorn was to pay for the wall repair and bed upgrade made the innkeeper much more friendly, and he happily continued to reserve Thorn's room for him.Although the money was only trickling in, Thorn was content. He had no particular desire for money, so he was not worried that the task he had taken barely paid for his daily expenses. Every day he made a couple of silver that he stashed away after paying for his colossal meals and his room.Once Thorn had been hunting corrupted wolves for a week, he decided to make another visit to the Training Hall to pay for the sword he had borrowed. Waving to the guards, he ducked into the hall. Hamm, about to start his familiar speech, saw him and brightened up.\"Hey, kid! You're back! Ready to learn how to wield that junky sword?\"\"Good morning.\" Thorn smiled back at the friendly trainer. \"Actually, I'm here to return the sword. I borrowed it last time I was here, but now I have enough money to buy one for myself.\"\"Wait, that is one of my swords?\" Surprised, Hamm grabbed the sword from Thorn and examined it. Seeing the familiar handle but damaged blade, he shook his head in disgust. \"What were you doing with it? Chopping rocks?! What did I tell you about control, kid? Look how trashed this blade is! After only a week too. Sheesh. You know, I'm starting to think you are not suited for swords.\"Glancing around at the hall, empty in the early morning, he turned back to look at Thorn. \"Listen, kid, you better scram before Janus gets here unless you want to spend the next year practicing shooting arrows. She threw quite the fit that you ran off last time. But I've got a tip for you. Out in the mountains, north of the city is a friend of mine who might have a combat style that is more suited to you. If you want to go further on the martial path, you should look him up.\"As Hamm finished speaking, a notification popped up, asking Thorn if he wanted to accept a new quest. Agreeing, Thorn opened the quest details. After getting rough directions from Hamm, Thorn thanked him and immediately left the Training Hall as fast as he could. Janus had reminded him of his aunt, and he was especially bad at dealing with those types. Since Hamm had recommended that Thorn not bother with a sword, he spent a few silver on a heavy machete that came with a sheath. Then, after having the smith who was selling it add a few serrations to the thick spine and sharpen the swage, Thorn tied it onto his lower back for easy access.The directions that Thorn had been given were not very precise, so he stopped back at the inn to let the staff know that he may be out for a couple of days and to stock up on some food that he could cook in the wilderness. Thorn had never been camping before, so he was eager to try spending a couple of nights out in the open. He had bought an extra-large blanket earlier in the week to cover his new bed, so he brought that along, as well.After a quick stop at an adventurer's shop, Thorn gathered up his gear and left the city through the north gate. To the north of the city, a large plain ran up to a small, mist-covered cluster of three mountains. Bisecting the plain was a lazy, winding river, a ferry waiting to take Thorn across for a single silver.Thorn had been in the game for about two weeks now and was settling into his new life. While he still had no overarching goals, he could roughly sense a new drive, a new purpose, beginning to form in his heart. Tempered by his frequent fights with corrupted wolves, Thorn had found great enjoyment in hunting them.Thanking the ferryman, Thorn jumped off the log raft and set off for the mountains. He was looking for a 'Master Sun' who was supposed to live somewhere on the second mountain. Hamm had told him that he might have to spend quite a while looking, but that did not bother Thorn one bit. The last thing he was lacking was time.While the quest log did not give him much information to go on, Thorn was interested in what this Master Sun could teach that Hamm and the other trainers couldn't. He agreed with Hamm that the sword was not a good weapon for his size. In fact, after weeks of fighting corrupted wolves, it was pretty obvious that even his Taijiquan was not well suited for fighting, either.Taijiquan itself was highly effective, but it had been designed to allow a lesser force to fight against a greater force. In the three weeks that he had been playing Nova Terra, Thorn had never found himself in a situation where his force was exceeded by his opponents. The longer he fought the wolves, the more he realized that he could swat them out of the air, killing them as they jumped at him. There was no need to dodge or attempt to divert the attacking energy when he could meet it and overcome it with force.For a while, Thorn thought the solution to this would be to get a bigger, heavier sword. But even that did not seem to be optimal, as Thorn found that it was easier, albeit more dangerous, to use his hands and feet. The speed of readying a weapon could not compare to the speed of a palm strike, and his palm strikes rivaled the destructive power of a sword swing.This realization had dawned on Thorn after he was surprised by a trio of corrupted wolves immediately after dispatching another group. About to collect the tails of the first group, Thorn heard a sound and looked up in time to see a large wolf bounding toward him. Instead of drawing his sword which was stuck in one of the wolf corpses next to him, Thorn instinctively swung a backhanded chop that smashed the wolf's spine and almost severed its head.After crushing the other two wolves with a couple of punches, Thorn realized that he had actually killed these wolves faster than normal. Much faster, in fact. From that point on, he had abandoned his sword and started killing the corrupted wolves with his hands and feet, increasing his daily hunting counts.By the time evening had arrived, he had reached the foot of the second mountain, so Thorn decided to set up camp. As the last rays of sunlight slipped over the horizon, Thorn pulled out the fire starter he had bought and tried to light a campfire. After a few failed attempts, he finally got a blaze going and sat down to enjoy a meal.Given his total lack of cooking experience, Thorn had opted to bring pre-cooked food that he purchased from the inn. His storage space kept everything at the same state it was when it was put into his inventory, so he did not have to heat up the food again or worry about it going bad.Thinking that it would be better to have a light meal before he set out again, Thorn pulled out a whole roasted chicken, a massive bowl of rice, two gallons of tea and a bunch of condiments, spreading them out on the ground before digging in. As he was finishing up his meal, Thorn heard a surprised exclamation from the edge of his camp.", "\"Hey, you're that frea...that big guy from before!\" stammered a voice, catching itself mid-sentence. Looking up from his meal Thorn, saw the red-haired girl in the witch's hat who had run into him the first day he had arrived in Nova Terra. \"Hello,\" replied Thorn in response, taking her in. Dressed in open fronted cloth robes with hot pants and a belly shirt, she presented the classic look of a fantasy witch, from the pointy hat perched on her mass of red hair to the high heeled boots with a slight curve in the toe.\"Yeah, I was going back into town to drop off some skins since our bags were getting too full. Oh! I have a great idea! Come with me!\" Turning back the way she had come, she grabbed Thorn by the hand and pulled him along as she dashed off. Or at least, she tried to. Pulling on him was no different than trying to pull a mountain with a tow rope. Thorn didn't move at all, and the unexpected resistance knocked her off her feet again.Thorn quickly took a step forward and put out a hand to steady her. Taking the opportunity, the red-head continued to pull him forward as she walked toward a small hill that was off to the left while Thorn, somewhat perplexed, followed. Over the top of it, Thorn found a small group of individuals sitting around a small fire, taking care of their equipment.The group watched them approach. As the two got close, a six-foot human who seemed to be armed like a knight moved forward to greet them while an elf in robes shifted a wand closer to hand and someone who looked like a dwarf slipped back into the darkness. \"Mina, who is this?\" called out the knight, his hand tucked into his belt near his sword as he looked at the giant before him.\"Ouroboros, this is that guy I was telling you about! The huge noob I ran into a couple weeks ago in the starter field. Noob, this is my team, Ouroboros, Velin, and Jorge!\" Finally letting go of his hand, Mina gestured toward the knight, the cleric and the back of the camp where the small figure had disappeared.\"Uh, hi. My name is Xa...Thorn. Um...sorry for intruding.\" Thorn felt quite bashful. It was his first real interaction with other players, and he wasn't sure how to handle it. Normally when people looked at him it was with fear, strange fascination or pity, but the group in front of him seemed to not care about his abnormal size.\"Nice to meet you, Thorn,\" said the knight, reaching out a hand. \"I'm Ouroboros, the leader of our small band of misfits. By your gear, am I right to assume you only started Nova Terra a little while ago?\"\"Yeah, I started a couple of weeks ago,\" responded Thorn, taking the offered handshake. He was thankful that the game seemed to scale his force based on his intentions, so Thorn didn't have to pay careful attention not to crush the knight's armored hand. \"I just met Mina for the second time a few moments ago, and I'm not quite sure why she brought me over.\"\"Oh, yeah, yeah. Ouroboros, you said we needed to recruit a fifth for that mission; why don't we take Thorn here? He looks super strong, so I bet we can loot everything!\" Thorn could almost see the dollar signs in her eyes as she gushed to her team.By this point, the cleric had come over and a short figure appeared next to Thorn, revealing Jorge to be a dwarf in dark leather with a wicked-looking curved knife that he was in the process of sheathing. \"Pleased to meet you,\" said Jorge in a gravelly voice. \"Can you carry a pack?\"\"Uh, yes?\" Thorn wasn't sure where this was going.\"Good.\" And with that, the gruff dwarf walked back to the fire, where he resumed caring for his gear.Following the dwarf, Ouroboros invited Thorn back to the fire to share the meal they were eating, and the group sat down together while Ouroboros explained their situation. The four of them were a group of adventurers who took quests from the traveler's board. They had been thinking about taking on another quest, but it required five members. They had been discussing going back to town to see if they could find someone who would be willing to sign on with their group as a Porter.Seeing that Thorn was unfamiliar with the term, Mina explained. It turned out that a Porter was a player who took on a special group role in Nova Terra that could be assigned by a group leader to one of the members of their party. It increased inventory space and reduced the weight of the items the porter carried, but it prevented any special movement abilities or skills from being used. Additionally, there were some restrictions on how the Porter could use their inventory. Anything that the Porter put into their inventory from the party could only be retrieved by the group leader and was sent to the group leader when the party was disbanded, preventing the Porter from being able to run away with all the loot. The main exception was, when the porter died, they would drop all the loot they had picked up.The quest they were about to undertake promised a fair amount of loot as well as quite a few chances to gather skins, so the group wanted to make sure they could bring everything back with them. The quest itself was something they could complete with four players, and bringing along a noob to act as Porter would help the group maximize their profits. It sounded good to Thorn, as it would help him get a better understanding of the game. Plus, Ouroboros was offering to pay him two gold a day plus 5% of their total haul as compensation, so he agreed.Pleased, Mina welcomed Thorn to the group with an overwhelming flood of words. Seeing his somewhat frantic look, Ouroboros cut in while Mina was taking a breath, ignoring her nasty glare.\"So, Thorn, why don't you tell us a bit about yourself?\"\"Sure,\" said Thorn, nodding his head. \"I started playing only a couple weeks ago, and I'm still getting used to this whole thing. This is my first time with a virtual reality game like this, but I am learning as I go. So far I've been hunting wolves for the bounty, which has kept me going pretty well.\"\"Oh wow, so you really just started! Are you having any trouble getting used to the time dilation? When I first started, I would always forget that there was a time difference, which caused me some issues.\"\"It hasn't been too bad. Things seem to move at a slower pace in game than they would in real life, which helps quite a bit.\"\"That is true.\" Ouroboros nodded. \"Still, loading into the game in the morning and experiencing multiple days in the game always threw me off since it was the same day when I logged out at night. I have a regulator, which helps me play more consistently.\"\"A regulator?\" asked Thorn.\"Man, you are a noob,\" laughed Mina.\"Sleep regulators are devices that attach to your gaming equipment. They help you wake up and sleep on a particular schedule that minimizes your time out of the game. It lets you play while you sleep. Professional gamers use them to maximize the number of hours they can be in the game,\" Ouroboros explained with a smile.\"Whoa, are you all pro gamers?\" asked Thorn in astonishment.\"Yup. We are part of Ragnarok.\"Surprised, Thorn could not help his indrawn breath. Despite being a noob, Thorn was not entirely ignorant. Ragnarok was one of the strongest guilds in Nova Terra! Made up of elites, Ragnarok was an absolute powerhouse and held numerous records in the game. Unlike the Society of Roses, who were mercenaries, Ragnarok kept to themselves and worked to unlock the many secrets of Nova Terra.Thorn, excited to have fallen in with guild players, began asking questions, and Ouroboros kindly humored him, chatting about Nova Terra while Mina interjected long rambling rants every time they got onto a subject that caught her fancy. Jorge, on the other hand, sat by the fire drinking out of a large mug that seemed to never run dry. The cleric, Velin, sat near Ouroboros, tossing a word in when she felt like it.After a couple hours had passed, Velin got to her feet and excused herself, mentioning that she had to log out to eat. Deciding to give everyone a break and to resume on the next game day, Ouroboros set a time to meet, and the group of four logged out, leaving Thorn to wait out the night. While he was waiting, Thorn fished out some more food and enjoyed another meal. Once he finished, he pulled up his in-game browser and began to look through the information on parties. After having lived his entire life without much interaction with his peers, Thorn had never even thought of forming a party. He had assumed that he would go through Nova Terra the same way he went through life. Alone.However, that wasn't really a fair assessment since he had been surrounded by people his whole life. His aunt had taken wonderful care of him, and he trained with his master at least once a day. Additionally, he generally got along quite well with the nurses and doctors with whom he came into contact, to say nothing of the bodyguards who followed him and his aunt around at all times.Despite the presence of so many other people in his life outside the game, Thorn couldn't help his overwhelming feelings of being alone. One of the counselors he had talked to had aptly described it as 'feeling trapped in your own skin'. For many years, Thorn had thought that his feelings were unique because of his situation, but talking with counselors had helped him understand that this feeling of loneliness in a crowd was a common thing.Thinking about the next day's activities, Thorn could not suppress his mounting excitement about working with Mina and the others. Hunting the corrupted wolves was fun, but Thorn was determined to explore all the wonders of Nova Terra, and that meant playing well with others. About to turn in for the night, a pop-up announced that he had gotten a new message. Expecting that it was his aunt bothering him about playing together, Thorn sighed and clicked on the notification. To his surprise, it was actually a message from his master, Ms. Chen, asking how the game was going and if his training had been helpful. His sleepiness vanishing, Thorn opened up the video chat feature and recorded a message to send to her. He explained how the Taijiquan he had learned had been helpful for the most part. However, he was running into Taijiquan moves that seemed good in practice but were not helpful because of his size.Several times he had tried to execute a move when fighting the corrupted wolves only to completely miss because of the size difference. Taijiquan had been created with two similar sized people in mind, and as a result, he was struggling to put it into practice with his massive form. On the other hand, when it worked, it was very effective! After explaining his experiences so far in the game, Thorn asked for some advice on how to make what he already knew work against smaller, weaker enemies.Closing off the message with a description of his interactions with Hamm, the sword trainer from the Training Hall, Thorn bowed with respect and said goodbye before clicking the send button. Due to the difference in time between the game and real life, the message had to be processed so that it wouldn't look to Ms. Chen like it was being fast forwarded.Thorn suspected that what he needed was more practice in how to apply the techniques, but he was hoping that his master would have some good insight into how he could use the forms that were second nature to him now for effective combat.Sending the video message to his master got Thorn thinking about the issues with his form that were brought about by his size. Many of the smaller joint manipulations and locks that he had been seeing did not work the same way for him due to how large his hands were. At the same time, he was so strong that he found he could overpower everyone else he had met in a direct contest of force. For someone who had trained for more than ten years to employ as little force as possible in his movements, this concept was throwing him for a loop. For example, when he matched strength with the large warrior in the Training Hall, he had tried to give way to his opponent's strength in order to use his force against him, but no matter how much he gave way, his opponent simply couldn't move him. Yet, when he exerted a force of his own, his opponent could not even begin to handle it. The same thing had happened countless times when fighting against the corrupted wolves. Moves that were designed to accept and redirect force did not work the way they were supposed to while moves that would never work for a normal person killed the corrupted wolves with ease. Palm strikes intended to deflect crushed bone instead. Granted, it was not the worst problem to have in a fight.Having finally verbalized the problem he was having, Thorn decided to do some research on other fighting styles. Over the next nine hours, Thorn combed through the game forums and searched for other types of martial arts that favored a more direct, aggressive approach. A couple of the different styles caught his eye, and he spent some time looking them up and sorting them according to his interest.Direct striking arts like Karate from Japan and Pencak Silat, which had been created in Indonesia, both favored sharp powerful strikes and hard offense. While both contained empty hand and weapon forms, Silat was more weapon oriented while Karate favored empty hand forms over weapon forms. Another interesting martial art out of Thailand was Muay Thai, a hard striking art that placed special emphasis on external strengthening. While adaptive combat arts like Systema from Russia and Krav Maga from Israel were also popular, they focused more on defense and grappling, which was not Thorn's main focus. Taijiquan was only one of the many Chinese martial arts, and at first, Thorn looked for another Chinese martial art to learn, but he realized that almost all of them were very similar to Taijiquan in their movements. Putting them aside until his master responded to his message, he looked instead for an art that he could learn on his own to maximize his attacking potential.", "Thorn was still sitting by the fire looking through his in-game browser when the others returned. While it had been a full ten hours since they had logged out for Thorn, only an hour and a half had passed for them. Enough time to stretch, take a shower and grab something to eat. As for Thorn, he had been watching martial arts videos the entire time. However, before he could settle on a particular style, Mina and the others arrived at the camp. Closing the browser, he stood up to greet them, dwarfing even Ouroboros' six feet.\"Geez, you are big,\" Mina complained, craning her neck to look up at Thorn's face. At 5' 3\", she was just over half his height and barely came up to his belly button.\"Hey, Thorn,\" greeted Ouroboros. \"You all rested up?\"Nodding, Thorn gathered all his stuff and put out the fire.\"Excellent. We're heading to the valley now. I'll explain on the way.\" Leading the group, Ouroboros started outlining the task at hand. \"About ten miles out, there's a small valley that is currently occupied by a few different tribes of kobolds. Normally they aren't a big issue because the tribes fight each other incessantly, but there are reports that they have united. Kobolds reproduce quickly, so they become a huge threat when they get organized.\"There have been reports of kobold Greater Shaman showing up, so we have been tasked with scouting the situation and killing the Greater Shaman. It is a five-man job, but our guild works in groups of four, so we thought it would be a good idea to bring a porter along. Oh, that reminds me. We haven't actually talked about our classes yet. I'm a Holy Guardian, Mina is an Ice Witch, Jorge is a Shadow Assassin, and Velin is a War Priestess.\"\"Wow, you all have classes? That is pretty impressive,\" commented Thorn.Classes in Nova Terra were a rare and somewhat controversial part of the game. While the game put forth the claim that anyone could do anything in game, the ancient inheritances scattered around the land that allowed players to gain special classes were not available to everyone. These classes unlocked special abilities and paths that allowed the players who received them to grow into powerful characters.Classes could be almost anything, and there were countless classes scattered throughout the game. Organized into three ranks, a class' strength was determined by the number of words in its name. Classes like Warrior, Priest, Mage, and Rogue, were common and could be acquired through specialized statues that could be collected from difficult dungeons. Each statue could, for a price, grant the class it was associated with to any number of people.Rarer were two-word classes like Holy Guardian, Great Sage, Ghostly Warlock, and Master Thief. Two-word classes were powerful, uncommon, and granted from a limited number of mini-statues that were given as rewards for long quest chains. Every uncommon class holder was considered an elite of the highest order, and for Mina, Ouroboros, Velin, and Jorge to all be uncommon class holders showed that not only were they professional gamers, but they were among the best.Smirking at Thorn's starstruck expression, Jorge looked at Thorn's monstrous frame and said, \"What about you? You must have picked up a crazy class to get a body like that.\"\"Haha,\" laughed Thorn, embarrassed, \"I'm pretty tall in real life.\"\"You must be almost seven feet tall!\" exclaimed the normally quiet Velin after doing some quick math.\"Ha, she thinks I made myself taller,\" thought Thorn. \"Still, that was some quick math.\"\"Haha, something like that.\" Changing the subject Thorn, asked about their classes. \"Did you all have to complete long quests to get your classes? I heard that was the only way to get uncommon classes.\"\"Sort of. Ouroboros and I were able to do much of our quests together, which helped the whole thing go faster,\" said Mina. \"Jorge got his on his own while Velin got hers when she joined Ragnarok.\"\"Mina, that's enough,\" said Ouroboros, shooting her a disapproving look.\"Oops, sorry. There goes my mouth again.\" Covering her mouth with an exaggerated grimace, she peeked at Thorn. \"I shouldn't be talking about it. Top secret information and all that.\"\"I'm sorry, I didn't realize it was private,\" said Thorn.\"No problem, it just isn't something that players go around talking about. To professional gamers, knowing someone's class is like having a guidebook to their capabilities, so you can imagine that people guard that information,\" replied Ouroboros with a wave. \"Mina should know better. But I'm sure she would have blabbed it out even if you hadn't asked.\"Sticking her tongue out at Ouroboros, Mina grabbed Velin's arm and pulled her off to the side.\"Come on, Velin, let's walk over here away from all the stupid boys.\"Worried that the atmosphere was going to get awkward, Thorn asked about the size of the valley they were going to, learning that it was about three miles wide and nine miles long. That reminded Mina of something that she had wanted to talk about, so she ran back over to Thorn's side, leaving Velin rolling her eyes.Their trip did not take long, and the valley soon came into view. Stopping the party, Ouroboros laid out the plan.\"Based on our intel, there are six different tribes in the valley. At least three of them have a Shaman, so we will need to be aware while we are fighting them. The Greater Shaman is the main target this time, but we are not sure where he is; we'll need to flush him out. The plan is to take down the three villages with Shaman to make the Greater Shaman mad. Jorge, you are in charge of clearing the path for us. It will be a pain if we alert the main camp, so no messing around, okay? Thorn, you'll stick with Mina, Velin, and me until we engage. Once we do, stay back until we've cleared the mobs, then pick up anything that drops. Oh, do you know how to skin animals?\"\"I have never skinned anything before.\" Thorn shook his head.\"Okay, no problem. Mina, you are in charge of skinning after we clear. Try to show Thorn how as we are going,\" said Ouroboros, adjusting the large shield on his arm. Finished with the plan, he nodded to Jorge. \"Let's go.\"As soon as the words left his mouth, the entire air of the group changed. A deep calm settled over them as they prepared to move out. Jorge slipped into the forest, while Mina, not speaking for once, stepped close to Thorn. The two of them followed Ouroboros, whose friendly demeanor had chilled, a grim expression resting on his face. The only one who seemed unchanged was Velin, who continued following quietly as she had the whole time.Every once in a while,, as they moved through the forest on the valley floor, Ouroboros would make adjustments in their direction. At first, Thorn did not recognize what was happening, but soon he realized that each time Ouroboros would make a change, a bird call would ring out. Furrowing his brows, he looked at Mina, who confirmed that the bird was actually Jorge.Soon they began to see more evidence of Jorge's passing as they began to find fresh kobold corpses along their path. Goblin sized creatures, kobolds had a snout and ears like a dog and paws for feet. Their fur-covered skin was valuable in large enough quantity so Mina got to work, showing Thorn how to skin them, starting from the cut that Jorge had made on their neck or in their back. Despite her normally frivolous attitude, Mina was proficient at skinning, and after a couple demonstrations, Thorn had a good grasp of the basics. They continued on like this for a while before Ouroboros called for a halt.\"There should be a village up ahead. Jorge should be back after checking it out. Mina, we're going to go with a standard assault. Velin, the Shaman will be yours to deal with. If you have any issues, shout.\" Turning to look at Thorn, he smiled. \"Thorn, all you need to do for the assault is watch. Kobolds are quite weak on their own but can be dangerous when they get into a group. Enough of them and their teeth and claws become a problem. The Shaman is a different story, though. Shamans have an annoying poison magic that is especially dangerous, so try to stay at least 100 feet back. That should keep you out of his range.\"Nodding his head to indicate that he understood, Thorn followed behind the other three, his heartbeat speeding up. So far, he had only stumbled around Nova Terra, doing whatever came up. All of his encounters with enemies were with small groups, so he was interested to see how four people could handle an entire village of monsters. Plus, there was a lot of talk about how different elite players were from regular players, so he was excited to see how they would handle a large fight like this.At the edge of the forest, a ramshackle wooden wall appeared before the group. From what Thorn could see, the wall, which stood about five feet tall, protected a few buildings that looked more like piles of junk, and a cave entrance. Dotted here and there were poles decorated with bones and feathers, giving the village a tribal feel.Hearing another bird call, Ouroboros nodded to the others, and then, lowering his shield, he clashed his sword into it and charged! As his sword rang on the shield, a milky white wave spread out from him, covering the party in a white sheen, and Thorn received a notification that he had been blessed with Greater Fortitude.Ouroboros charged forward like a freight train, his metal armor shining in the morning sun. At first, Thorn was a bit confused, as they were not near the gate, but that confusion was soon cleared up as he watched Ouroboros speeding up. Lowering his body behind his shield as he reached the wall, Ouroboros gave a roar and bashed his way right through the wooden palisade!Wood splintered and flew through the air as Ouroboros crushed his way through the wall, clearing two screeching kobolds with a casual swing of his sword. The kobolds, caught off guard, went running this way and that as Ouroboros laid into them. Mina and Velin, who had reached the destroyed wall, began to attack as well, leaving Thorn standing on the edge of the forest.Mina, raising a wand with a shining blue gem on the end began to whisper, pointing her wand at a group of kobolds, who were blanketed in a cold, sleeting rain. As the icy sludge covered the kobolds, the heat drained out of their limbs, slowing them down. Unable to shake off the freezing spell, the kobolds began to struggle, losing more and more body heat by the second. Within a few seconds, their struggles slowed and then ceased, leaving only cold corpses.Waving her wand toward another group, Mina continued her whispering, leaving behind nothing but bodies. Meanwhile, Velin stood in between Mina and Ouroboros, who was cutting down any kobold foolish enough to get in range of his sword. Standing there calmly, Velin seemed to be waiting for something to happen.Thorn, watching from behind, was stunned by the efficiency of the team. Ouroboros, after crashing through the wall, had advanced until he was about twenty feet into the camp, where he now stood, holding the point against increasing waves of kobold warriors. Mina and Velin had come in after him, with Mina standing closest to the wall.Despite their best efforts, any kobold that tried to approach from the sides was met with Mina's freezing spell, creating a natural wall of frozen bodies and ground on either side of the team. This forced the kobolds who wanted to attack to rush toward Ouroboros' position, where they were chopped into pieces by his flashing sword.When Thorn thought that the fight would end without any climax, an angry screech rose from the mouth of the cave as a kobold with red dyed fur and countless bone totems rushed out. Or tried to. As soon as the screech sounded, Velin, who had been standing between Ouroboros and Mina, lifted her staff. Chanting, a light began to gather on the end of her staff, creating a blinding glow.Even standing a hundred feet behind her, Thorn could feel the danger emanating from the gathering energy. Unfortunately for the kobolds, their Shaman was either too far away or not sensitive enough because he continued to rush forward, waving a wand of his own. Velin finished charging her staff and, with the last word, thrust it toward the Shaman.From the tip of the staff, a bright beam of light the width of a tree branch shot out, cutting toward the Shaman! With a guttural growl, the Shaman activated one of his totems, covering himself with a blazing flame shield. The beam of light blasted into the shield, causing it to shake wildly. Pausing the beam for a brief second, the shield was unable to handle the strength of Velin's attack, and with a bang, it exploded in a wave of flame. Continuing forward, the beam of light struck the Shaman in the chest, instantly burning a hole right through him!The beam of white light left a charred hole in everything it touched. Looking at the smoking trail it left, Thorn couldn't help but gulp. What a powerful spell!'How about I don't get on her bad side,' Thorn thought to himself, throwing a glance at Velin, who was wiping a fine layer of sweat from her forehead.After the Shaman's death, the fight ended almost abruptly as the now leaderless kobolds fell into even more disarray, rushing around in panic. Unable to see Jorge at first, Thorn was about to ask about him when he noticed a kobold on the edge of the village jerk, a gleaming knife tip protruding from its chest. As it fell to the ground, Jorge was revealed behind its back. As soon as he retrieved his knife, Jorge faded away, moving on to his next target.\"Hmmm, must be some sort of stealth ability related to his class. I wonder if it would work for me?\" Thorn mused. He could imagine the chaos it would cause if he could turn invisible.Seeing that the group was cleaning up the last of the kobolds, Thorn sprang into action, pulling some of the corpses that had no heads back from the group and beginning to skin and loot them. Having gotten used to the method that Mina had taught him, it only took a bit over an hour to process the entire village. Many of the kobold's bodies had been destroyed beyond redemption, but even so, Thorn was astounded at how fast the process went.\u00a0", "When Thorn asked Mina about it, she mentioned that, for tedious tasks like skinning, the system actually applied a bit of assistance, so that players wouldn't become bored with it. Thorn nodded to himself, thankful for the game designer's foresight. After finishing the skinning, Thorn picked up a pile of loot that Jorge had found from scrounging through the village.\"How much room do you have open, Thorn?\" Ouroboros asked, getting ready to leave the destroyed village.\"I'm good. I still have 80% of my team inventory open.\" \"Holy Terra! Thorn, your inventory must be enormous!\" gasped Mina. \"How freakishly strong are you?\"\"Haha, I'm not that strong, just big,\" said Thorn with a laugh, downplaying his ability.\"Good, that means we should be able to clear the next valley without a problem,\" said Ouroboros with a nod. \"The next village is close by. Let's head there now. We'll take a break after we finish clearing it.\"Ouroboros blew two short, sharp blasts on a whistle, and then the group moved out, leaving the ruins of the kobold village behind. As they walked along through the forest, occasionally coming across kobold corpses, courtesy of Jorge, Thorn couldn't help but be impressed by this group he had joined.From the comfortable but focused way they proceeded, it was obvious that the group had worked together for a long time, each person fitting into their role like a well-oiled cog in an efficient machine. Each had a role and trusted the others in the group to fill their role as well. Seeing how they had crushed the village of kobolds without any trouble at all, Thorn could only marvel at the difference between this party and regular players. Elites indeed!And to think that they were part of a guild of others like them. Shaking his head, Thorn thought to himself that this game hid some scary people! Even putting aside the terrifying white beam that Velin had shot out, Mina's deadly blizzard was equally dangerous. And that was to say nothing of Ouroboros, who held off close to two hundred kobolds, almost single-handedly blocking them and killing at least half of them!Then there was Jorge, who had not stopped dropping kobold corpses in their path since they started. Fast, deadly, and invisible. Thorn felt a cold shiver travel down his spine. These people, though friendly on the surface, were dangerous. Very dangerous.\"Hey Thorn, what sort of class are you thinking of taking?\" Mina asked, unable to stand the silence.\"Hm? Oh, class? I don't know yet,\" Thorn confessed after thinking for a minute. \"I'd be suited to something like a tank, but I was also thinking about getting a non-combat class like a craftsman or something. I heard that there is good money in non-combat classes.\"\"What! How lame.\" Mina rolled her eyes. \"Non-combat classes are so lame. Why would you want to play a game to spend all your time working?\"\"Mina, without non-combat classes, you wouldn't have half your gear,\" Velin remarked flatly, throwing a glance at the ranting witch.\"Well, yeah. But look at Thorn's size! It would be a total waste for Thorn to not be a warrior,\" Mina replied, patting as high up as she could reach on Thorn's arm. \"I mean, look at him! His arm is bigger than me! Can you imagine him in full Hellplate, with a Barbed Greatsword? It would be epic!\"\"Hellplate?\" asked Thorn.\"It's a kind of plate armor used by warriors and other offensive melee classes,\" said Ouroboros, sending Thorn a link to a picture in his in-game browser.\"Oh, that would look pretty impressive,\" said Thorn, looking at the spiked armor in the picture.\"Alright, let's continue this conversation later,\" Ouroboros said, pointing toward a village on the top of a hill. \"Get ready for a fight. Same as last time.\"Watching the group spring into action, Thorn couldn't help but be envious of their smooth cooperation. Each stepped into their role smoothly, and the result was the complete and utter destruction of the kobold village within ten minutes of the start of the fight. The only difference was that this time the kobold Shaman surprised the group by casting a spell before they spotted him, resulting in poisonous projectiles raining down from the sky. However, even with the ambush, the team responded without missing a beat. Velin, who had been channeling energy into her staff, lifted it into the air and covered herself, Mina, and Ouroboros with a shield that deflected the falling arrows into the surrounding kobolds. At the same time, Ouroboros whistled, two long, one short and then turned back to killing the kobolds that mobbed around him.Less than a minute later, after the arrows had stopped falling, Jorge appeared with the Shaman's head, which he tossed into the milling crowd of kobolds, sending them scrambling in terror. After they finished dealing with all of the kobolds in the village, they made camp a ways away and got ready to settle in for the night. According to the map that Ouroboros pulled out, the other village was close, so they would be able to handle it the next day and then go after the Greater Shaman. After a peaceful night, they pressed on, and Thorn witnessed them repeat their deadly process on the last village with a Shaman. As he was sweeping up the loot, Thorn asked why they were only bothering with the villages with a Shaman.\"Because the other villages will have no worthwhile loot,\" said Jorge, appearing out of nowhere.\"Exactly,\" confirmed Ouroboros. \"Our actual goal here is to clear the Greater Shaman. We shouldn't have an issue, but we wanted to make sure that he was not able to team up with the other Shaman. As you can see, we are not afraid of numbers, but numbers and multiple casters can be a pretty serious problem.\"As he finished speaking, a guttural roar echoed through the air, causing the whole group to look toward the far end of the valley.\"That's our cue,\" smiled Ouroboros. \"Let's go end this thing.\"\"About time! I want to wash my hair,\" quipped Mina with a laugh.Cutting through the forest in the direction of the Greater Shaman, the group abandoned all semblance of stealth. For a moment, Thorn was concerned. What if the kobolds from the three other villages that they had not cleared gathered together? He could only imagine the size of that army. But then he remembered the sight of Mina's blizzard spell ending the lives of the kobolds en masse and mentally shrugged. It was not the first time the group had done this, so they knew what they were doing. Plus, Thorn was having a blast following them around, even if he was hiding at the back and picking up the loot. It was nice to see them in action and watch their well-practiced cooperation.They found the Greater Shaman on a large rock at the end of the valley. Peeking out from behind some trees at the edge of the forest, they could see him berating a group of kobolds that looked a bit larger than normal, his spittle flying as he raged at them. The six kobolds he was yelling at were not only larger but much better dressed than the other kobolds they had come across in the valley so far.\"Kobold Chieftains,\" Mina whispered, seeing Thorn's questioning look. \"No wonder we didn't see them at the other towns,\" commented Velin, joining the conversation. \"This might be a bit more trouble than the other fights.\"\"Alright, change of plans.\" Ouroboros cut off the conversation with a wave of his hand. \"Six is a bit much for me to handle, so we'll put Mina and Velin on defense. I'll handle the Greater Shaman while Jorge helps the girls with taking down the Chieftains.\"\"Is there a way I can help?\" asked Thorn, eager to contribute.\"Do you have a bow?\" Seeing Thorn shake his head no, Ouroboros smiled. \"Thanks, but we got it.\" Frustrated, Thorn could only watch as the others moved forward to engage the milling kobolds. Was it the fact that he was still wearing the beginner's clothes and didn't have a visible weapon? Due to his size, Thorn had tried his best to present as non-threatening a persona as possible since most people were instinctively insecure around him as it was. In this case, it seemed to have backfired and given Ouroboros the idea that he was weak.How very different this world was. Nova Terra was so similar to the real world that it was easy to forget that there were some very basic rules that were not the same. In the real world, society had settled the issue of crime, and resorting to violence to solve problems was unacceptable. In Nova Terra, violence was often the first and only means of settling a conflict.This made the agreeableness that Thorn had spent so long developing worth very little in this crazy new world. While it seemed to help in his interactions with the NPCs he encountered, so far his gentle persona had been more of a hindrance than a help when dealing with others. Seeing the team engage in combat, Thorn decided that he would find some armor and a sling for his weapon when he got back to town.Maybe that would help toughen up his image and make the other players he encountered take him a bit more seriously. After all, how lame would it be to continue hanging around the back while other people did all the fighting?By this point, the team had engaged the kobolds, but their formation was completely different from the last three big fights. Instead of creating his usual immovable defense, Ouroboros chanted in a strange language, summoning a blood-red aura that covered both him and his weapons. Even from all the way in the back, Thorn could feel the uncomfortable suppression the red mist caused. 'It's like being stared at by a predator!' Thorn thought to himself. 'This must be what they mean when they talk about killing intent.'While Thorn felt a bit uncomfortable, it was obvious that the blood mist had a much larger impact on the kobolds facing Ouroboros. Many became too terrified to move, and it wasn't until the Great Shaman roared out a command and the chieftains bounded forward that the rest of the kobolds managed to recover.As the chieftains moved, Velin stepped forward as well, waving her staff toward Ouroboros and Mina. Around each of them, a faint golden shield bloomed. Mina's looked like a regular shield spell, but when the golden shield rose around Ouroboros, it mixed with the bloody mist around him, turing a deep rose gold.Feeling the empowerment from the shield spell, Ouroboros gave a roar and launched himself through the air, jumping an astonishing twenty feet! Flying over the charging kobold chieftains, Ouroboros was about to fall when a pillar of ice with a flat top shot up from the ground, giving him an easy place to land and jump again! This ice pillar that appeared from nowhere allowed him to propel himself all the way to the Greater Shaman, who had failed to react in time.Lashing out with a ferocious slash, Ouroboros began a frenzied assault on the Great Shaman's magic shield. Each blow seemed to become more and more powerful, causing the green magical shield around the Great Shaman to ripple. Additionally, the blood-red mist around Ouroboros' sword seemed to be attaching itself to the green shield, corroding it.Behind him, the six chieftains had engaged with Mina and Velin, who were at ease as they defended against the large kobolds. Mina deployed her blizzard spell, slowing down all of the surrounding kobolds while Velin summoned a bow of light and sent glimmering arrows raining down on the attacking force.To Thorn's complete and utter amazement, this fight, which was supposed to be the hardest part of the quest, ended faster than any of the earlier fights. It took less than thirty seconds for the Great Shaman's green magic shield to fall, and once it did, Ouroboros cut him to pieces immediately.Meanwhile, Mina's blizzard spell proved as effective as always, slowing all of the kobolds that came close to her and Velin. Any kobold that lost their ability to move soon found a golden arrow sticking out of their head or heart as Velin rapidly fired an endless stream of arrows out over the crowd.Jorge, unlike in the other fights, actually made an appearance, producing a second curved dagger and cutting a bloody swath around the edge of the crowd of kobolds, making sure to focus on those not affected by the icy sludge Mina was summoning. Within a bit less than three minutes, the four players had cleared almost 70% of the five hundred kobolds that had been milling around, as well as the six chieftains and the Great Shaman.Under Thorn's dumbfounded gaze, they spent another couple minutes wiping out the remaining 30% before waving to him. Realizing that the whole mission was over, Thorn walked to the battlefield, shocked by the incredible power shown by the four elite players. \"So that is the difference between an elite player and a regular player,\" Thorn thought, shaking his head in amazement.After waiting a moment for the effects of the blizzard spell to disappear, Thorn got down to skinning the massive number of kobolds that the team had taken down. The ones killed by Mina and Velin had almost perfect skins with only a single arrow hole in them. The kobolds that had been killed by Jorge and Ouroboros were unrecoverable. Jorge's victims were generally in multiple pieces and covered in long, bloody gashes. Similarly, Ouroboros' strong swings had sent the limbs of the kobolds he killed far from their bodies.Clearing all the loot took Thorn almost two hours of non-stop work. Finally finishing up, he walked over to Ouroboros, who was talking to Velin in a low voice. Falling silent when Thorn got close, Ouroboros turned to him and smiled.\"All finished? Then lets head back. With this, the mission is done, so we can turn it in. When we get back to Berum, we can divide the loot.\"Traveling back to town took less time than the trip to the valley, but the team was not in any rush, so they took it easy and spent another night in the wilderness. Before getting to town, Ouroboros changed out his gleaming full plate armor for armor made of scuffed leather and replaced his weapons with poor quality weapons. Similarly, the girls swapped out their weapons and high-quality items. Velin even produced a hat with a veil, covering her cold but beautiful face. Only Jorge didn't bother swapping out his gear, instead activating invisibility and disappearing into thin air. \"Alright, everyone ready?\" Ouroboros checked over everyone. \"Thorn, we don't want to draw any attention, so we are all going to split up. We'll meet at Champ's Adventuring Depot to process the loot.\"", "Nodding that he understood, Thorn watched the rest of the group split up, and after waiting for a moment, he walked toward the city. Berum, like many cities, was surrounded by a large wall with guard towers placed every hundred feet. Four gates, one in each cardinal direction, controlled traffic coming in and out of the city. Thorn soon arrived at the northern gate where the guards were watching players and NPCs walking in and out.Passing through the gate, Thorn ignored the guards' stares and made his way to the location that Ouroboros had marked on his map. Champ's was a spacious courtyard with a couple warehouses set around a large tent with the sides rolled up. Players queued by the tent, entering one at a time to have their items appraised by the NPCs. Spotting Ouroboros by the side, Thorn queued up and waited for his turn. After about half an hour of waiting, Thorn was called in front of one of the NPCs and started removing things from his inventory to place on the table. Objects like skins could be placed into stacks and were bundled by the system, otherwise Thorn might have buried the entire tent in kobold skins. As it was, he still took out over 700 skins, causing the NPC appraiser's mouth to drop open in shock.After that were piles of low-quality weapons, semi-rare resources dropped by the chieftains, and a couple of rare items dropped by the Shamans. The Great Shaman had only dropped a special token that Ouroboros had taken as proof that they had completed the quest, but the team had been able to recover a number of precious statues from his cave, which Thorn also took out.The appraiser, staring in amazement at the piles of loot that Thorn pulled out of his inventory, got busy calculating and soon gave Thorn a piece of paper with a series of numbers written on it. Looking at the paper, Thorn saw that it had a neat list of all of the items that Thorn had pulled out, each with a price associated with it. If the party leader agreed, Champ's would buy those items for that price. If they did not agree, the items would be returned to the team's inventory.Taking the list, Thorn walked to a nearby tavern, where he spotted Mina and Velin sitting with Jorge at a table. Walking over, he looked at the spindly chair for a moment before sighing and moving it to the side. Ignoring Mina, who was giggling, Thorn sat on the ground and put the list on the table.A few minutes later, Ouroboros arrived and, after a quick look at the list, approved all of the items. With a ding, the list was replaced by a pouch of gold. The skins alone came out to an astronomical 7,000 silver, or 70 gold, while the rest of the items had been sold for over 30 gold, giving the group a total profit of 103 gold! Thorn could only shake his head at the difference. He had slaved away for weeks to make only a few silver. Ouroboros had agreed to pay Thorn two gold a day plus 5% of the total profit from loot, bringing Thorn's share to 13.15 gold. Ouroboros handed Thorn 14 gold and waved him off when he tried to return the difference.\"Don't worry about it, Thorn. There is no way we could have carried this much back if it wasn't for you.\"Having settled the matter of money, Thorn and the others ordered food from a waitress who walked up to the table and continued to chat as they ate their food. Thorn was especially hungry and ended up spending a full ten silver on his meal, eating at least three times as much as the other three combined.\"Holy Terra, big guy!\" Mina exclaimed, shaking her head and pointing to the piles of empty plates. \"Aren't you afraid of getting fat? You ate more food than I would eat in a week!\"\"There is a lot of me to keep up,\" smirked Thorn, patting his belly.\"Yeah, no kidding.\" Seeing that Mina was going to launch into another verbal barrage, Velin gave Ouroboros a pointed look, causing him to swallow the food he was eating and jump into the conversation. However, his haste left him coughing, and it was only after a few minutes that he could actually get some words out.\"So, Thorn. Any plans now that the mission is done?\" \"None so far,\" said Thorn, scratching his head. \"I was thinking of looking for a class. Or I may get some weapon training. Watching you four has been eye opening, and I sort of feel like I have been wasting my time in Nova Terra so far. I was also thinking about picking up some other porter jobs since they suit me pretty well.\"\"That makes sense. Classes are pretty important.\" Velin took a small sip of her coffee before dabbing at her lips with her napkin. \"They introduce some specialties and abilities that you cannot get otherwise, which can be a huge advantage. Do you have any idea of what sort of class you want to get?\"\"Honestly? No idea.\" Thorn shook his head, playing with his cup. \"I have to do some more research. Do you have any recommendations?\"Hearing Thorn's response, both Mina and Velin looked at Ouroboros, who smiled and sighed. \"Why don't I give you a basic rundown of how classes work,\" Ouroboros said, unable to stand the looks from the girls. Pulling out a small, three sided pyramid from his inventory, Ouroboros placed it in the center of the table and activated it. Instantly, they were encased in an ethereal mist, the sounds of the busy tavern fading away. Seeing Thorn's interested look, Mina jumped in to explain that it was a sound isolation pyramid that would keep other people from hearing what they were talking about.\"That's right, I meant to ask about that,\" said Thorn in confusion. \"What is the big deal with classes being so secret?\"\"It isn't just classes, it is everything, really!\" replied Mina in excitement. \"Haven't you noticed that all of the information in Nova Terra is suppressed? If you want to find something out, you have to actually go and look for it or find someone who knows about it! No one knows why, but actually, Eve suppresses most of the information about Nova Terra that is spread to the outside world!\"\"Eve?\"\"You don't even know about Eve? Man, you really are a noob!\" declared Mina. \"Eve is the persona of the AI that runs Nova Terra. She is the first god and is the only AI entity that can interact with the outside world. She deletes or modifies posts on the forums to prevent information from spreading.\"\"Whoa. I mean, that makes sense though. When I was doing research before I started, there was very little concrete information about the game.\"\"Yeah, no one knows why. I mean, Eve says that too much information will break the immersive aspect of Nova Terra, but there are tons of other theories about why she shuts down information.\"\"What about in game?\" Thorn asked, leaning over the table in interest.\"Power,\" Ouroboros cut in, looking at Thorn with a piercing gaze.\"Power,\" Thorn repeated, leaning back as the group fell silent. Power. It did not take more than a second for Thorn to understand what Ouroboros was talking about. In a world like Nova Terra, information could be said to be the most precious thing. One of the most important aspects of the game was that there were drastic differences between what players brought into the game that could not be overcome by any amount of hard work. Some things could be trained, but others were fixed. Like Thorn himself, some players brought traits that gave them a huge advantage in the game while other players had a much more humble start. The only playing field that was completely even for all of the players when they started was knowledge. All of the players who came into the game were clean slates due to the level of control that Eve exercised on the release of information about Nova Terra.This made every sliver of knowledge that a player got in the game worth something. The player who knew more would naturally have an advantage over a player who knew less. More knowledge translated into more opportunity, more chances for growth. Take classes, for example. Even the most basic classes were not simple to acquire and could only be retrieved from the end of chain quests and specific dungeons. At the same time, having a basic class would allow a player to stand out from the crowds, giving them special abilities and talents that the average person could not possess, no matter how hard they worked.And that was to say nothing of the uncommon classes. A single uncommon class could create an elite, one of the best players in the game. But getting an uncommon class was as hard as ascending to the heavens, and no one was willing to share the opportunity with others. After all, that was the same as finding a winning lottery ticket and then giving it away.But it wasn't just classes. Information about quests, lost history, secret locations, even magic, were all protected pieces of information. Who knew if a single passage from a book on history could lead a player to a great ancient inheritance? And that was to say nothing of the practical advantages of having a class that no one else knew about or understood.As Ouroboros related, because of the advantage that information gave, all of the major guilds had come to a tacit understanding to keep information as tightly controlled as possible. The fewer people who knew, the fewer who could compete for the top spots in the game. As a result, many of the elite players were tight-lipped when it came to their classes and the things they knew about Nova Terra.\"That makes sense,\" Thorn said, after thinking it over for a moment. \"Not only does an information ban allow the major guilds to control who can grow and how fast, but it also grants them persuasive power. They can say things like, 'If you join me, you will get a special class.' That way they can grow while keeping the quality of their ranks. Pretty brilliant when you think about it.\"\"Exactly,\" said Ouroboros, a flash of appreciation lighting his eyes at how quickly Thorn grasped the main concept. \"Information has always been powerful, but it has taken on a new level of power here in Nova Terra, where we are all trying our best to unearth information about the game.\"\"So how do regular players find out information? Do they have to join a guild?\"\"Sort of. There are two ways to gain information besides finding it yourself and learning it from another player.\" Ouroboros took a drink. \"The first is by joining a guild. Every guild has its specialization, and the types of intel they have are going to be reflected by that. Guilds like ours, Ragnarok, are focused on game progression, so we have a lot of information on how to grow as players and how to complete quests. Other guilds, like The Eye of Oghma, which is focused on magic research, will be the best choice if you want to learn about magic.\"There are craftsman guilds that have unique recipes and mercenary guilds that have a huge breadth of knowledge due to the different tasks they have completed. Merchant guilds would be able to tell you the price of goods anywhere on the continent, and exploration guilds have mapped huge areas. Each guild protects their information very seriously, and one of the worst charges that a guild member can face is leaking sensitive information.\"The second way to find information is through the player guild, Avalon. Officially, its name is The Children of Avalon, but everyone calls it Avalon for short. No one knows much about them, but they seem to know everything about everyone. They are an intelligence organization that compiles information about every possible subject. You can buy information from them by exchanging for information, completing tasks, or paying outrageous prices.\"While we are on that topic, here's some more free information for you. There are three groups that you don't want to get on the wrong side of in Nova Terra, as all of them have the ability to make your life a living hell. The first of the three are the top ten guilds. They have too many powerful players and too much influence.\"\"Top ten guilds?\" Thorn opened his in-game browser and did a quick search, coming up with next to nothing.\"Yeah, you won't find them advertising themselves, but we keep an internal list. Hold on, and I'll send it to you.\" Ouroboros sent Thorn a message with a document attached.Opening it up, Thorn found a list of the top guilds with a small description. The Children of Avalon was at the top of the list, and Ragnarok was third, after a guild called Eastern Alliance. Thorn was surprised to see that his aunt's guild, the Society of Roses, was actually fifth on the list.\"Apart from Avalon and joining a guild, your only option is to find the information yourself. Which is not much of an option, if I am honest,\" said Ouroboros.\"Or to have awesome friends like us!\" said Mina.\"Right, or have awesome friends like us. I can give you a rundown of all the non-sensitive information about classes so you can make a good decision moving forward. Picking a path is pretty important for your future growth, so you'll want to pay careful attention to whether a class can upgrade. Some classes have a progression, while others are fixed in the state you get them.\"You are familiar with the classification for classes, right? One word classes are called common classes, two-word classes are called uncommon classes, and three-word classes are called rare classes. There are also unique classes that have four words, but so far there are only four of them in the whole world. Classes can be further broken down into five general categories: combat, utility, support, production, and leader.\"As Thorn listened attentively, part of his brain was realizing how truly fortunate he was to have fallen in with this group of players. There was absolutely no way he would have found out this kind of information so quickly on his own!", "\"Combat classes are pretty self-explanatory,\" Ouroboros continued. \"All the classes that are directly related to dealing damage or tanking are considered combat classes. That would include Knights, Warriors, Gunners, Monks, Battle Mages, Archers and that sort of thing. The distinctive feature of a combat class is that it includes both weapon and armor proficiencies. So the Warrior class will not only help you learn basic usage of all weapon types, but it will also help you gain proficiency with the different sorts of armor.\"Utility classes are those classes that focus on a non-combat roll while still having some combat ability. A Rogue or Thief would be a Utility class, as would a magic user who had spells that were non-combat oriented. Rangers, Scouts, Druids, and classes that combine wilderness utility with combat rolls are Utility classes as well. Most Utility classes have some abilities that can be used in combat and some that are used outside of combat. What divides them from all the other classes is their terrain bonuses. Take Thieves, for example, they get a bonus to their movement speed and evasion while in dark places.\"Support classes are things like Guardians, Priests, and Field Medics. Warlocks, Witches, and other debuffers are also part of the Support category. The essence of a support class is that they are helping buff their party or debuff their enemies. Some Support classes also grant either weapon or armor proficiencies. Support classes are one of the most popular because of how necessary they are. Good Supports are the difference between success and failure, and you can tell what sort of shape a guild is in by their Supports.\"Production classes are anything that lack a combat role but produce something. It could be goods or a service, even. So a Lawyer would be considered a Production class, even if they don't technically make anything. The production classes' abilities are almost never combat oriented, and they tend to focus on making tangible goods like armor, clothes, food, etc. Builders and architects are also considered Production classes. Production classes also scale differently than the other classes in that they have three ranks: Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master. It takes a lot of time and practice to rank up. There are some guilds who run their own Production Corps, but most guilds contract out to full Production guilds since it can be expensive to break through to Master.\"Last, there are the Leadership classes. These are pretty rare, but they include Generals, Tactical Advisors, any member of the peerage, or any class that gives bonuses to organizing players or NPCs. You might assume that these classes are useless since the abilities they give tend to be less concrete than the other classes, but they can actually be the most powerful, if used well. After all, what use is a sword facing an entire army? How do you fight someone who can send the city guard after you?\"Common classes are single category. They fill a single role and cannot grow beyond a specified point. Now, that is not to say there are not skilled players with common classes. It is just harder to excel with a narrow set of abilities than it is to succeed with a broader set. But never underestimate a common class holder. I've met some strong players who use the few abilities they have through their class to the best possible degree.\"\"Sheesh, are you done yet?\" interrupted Mina, resting her forehead on the table in annoyance.\"Almost,\" said Ouroboros with a smirk. \"You were the one who wanted me to talk about this. So you have to suffer through it. Where was I? Oh, right. Common classes are single category. Uncommon are dual category, rare are triple category, and unique are actually quad category. For example, my class, Holy Guardian, is both a Support and a Combat class. This means that I can fill both roles in a party. Now, having a single Holy Guardian will not be as strong as having a Priest and a Knight of comparable skill because two is always going to be greater than one.\"But having a dual category makes me much more flexible and allows me to react to different situations better than I otherwise would with a single category class. When multiple players with dual categories get together, that advantage only grows. You saw how we were able to adjust our roles in the fight against the Shaman and Great Shaman, right? That is due to the fact that we have an abundance of Combat Support dual category classes. This means we can pick the proper can opener for the can we are trying to open, rather than trying to force it.\"\"Doesn't that make dual category classes overpowered compared to single category classes?\" asked Thorn.\"Not really. There are some cases in which a dual category class is stronger than a single category class, but for the most part, all the classes in the game are well balanced. It is a matter of flexibility. Plus, if you have a single category class, and you master it, you can actually accept another class, which will promote you from a common class to an uncommon class. This is why it is so important to plan out your progression. But mastery isn't the only way to get a dual category class. It is much faster to use an ancient inheritance to gain an existing dual category class.\"\"I've heard that term tossed around, but I don't know what it means,\" said Thorn, scratching his head. The message boards had little bits and pieces of information, but they were by no means comprehensive due to Eve's strict information control.\"Well, buckle up, because Ancient Inheritances are a massive subject in and of themselves,\" replied Mina while Ouroboros was taking a drink. \"Actually, Velin knows the most about them.\"\"That is true,\" nodded Ouroboros. \"Why don't you explain how Ancient Inheritances work?\" \"Sure. I can do that,\" the elven War Priestess agreed, her voice never losing its customary cool. \"Ancient Inheritances are, at their most basic level, tokens that represent a class holder who reached the peak of their class. The token allows the class to be passed down to a player with the Mastery Abilities that the former class holder received for mastering their class.\" Seeing Thorn's confusion, she paused for a moment.\"Okay, let me back up. You know how production classes have three states: Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master? While the other classes don't have those levels, we use a similar classification to make it easier to judge how skilled a player is. Low level means that you have recently started the class and are still getting used to the ability the class gives you. Mid level is when your mastery has reached the minimum threshold necessary for you to use all of the abilities that your class gives. For some classes, this happens fast, as the abilities tied to the class don't have many mastery prerequisites. \"On the other hand, there are classes for which the mastery prerequisites are detailed and complex, and it might take a player years to get to the point where they can use their class abilities freely. Once you have become a mid level, everything becomes about perfecting your use of your class abilities. As you use those abilities, you gain mastery in them, the same way you gain proficiency in a skill you use over and over. High level is achieved when your mastery hits a particular threshold.\"Once you hit master, your class grants you a specific set of unique bonuses based on the way you have played up until this point. That means that if you are a Knight who focuses on defending and supporting others as you tank, you will be more likely to unlock the Holy Guardian path. On the other hand, if you focused on dealing damage, you might unlock the Retribution Knight path.\"Unlocking the path doesn't give you the second class needed to become a dual category class, but it does give you the opportunity and informs you of what other class you need to gain in order to get the dual class. On top of the option for a second class, mastery will also grant a passive buff to your abilities that you will carry with you for the rest of your journey in Nova Terra. This buff is one of the things that separates the elite players from the regular players.\"Inheritance tokens not only contain the opportunity to gain a class that has been mastered, but they also contain a buff that is unique to that token. Because they contain a mastery buff, Ancient Inheritances are all distinct from each other. I mean, there could be two Ancient Inheritance tokens that give you the same dual category or triple category class, but each of them has a distinct buff that is unique to the specific token. This makes some Ancient Inheritances worth more than others, even if they are both the same class.\"\"Huh, interesting.\" Thorn tapped on the table as he thought over what he had heard. \"So the Ancient Inheritances are different from regular class change stones in that they give you the bonus. But does that prevent you from getting another bonus when you master the class?\"\"No. That is what makes them so strong. First, all Ancient Inheritances are dual category classes or higher. If you have a dual category class and you master it, you will get two Mastery Abilities, one for each category. If you master a dual category Ancient Inheritance, you will have four Mastery Abilities. The two from the Inheritance and the two from mastering the class. You will also get the static buff that the Ancient Inheritance gives you.\"If you have a dual category class, and you master it, you'll have a Mastery Ability from your initial class and two Mastery Abilities from your dual class mastery. This means that mastering an Ancient Inheritance will give you one more Mastery Ability than a regular dual category class on top of the buff.\"\"Oh wow. I can see why Ancient Inheritances are so important. Especially the dual category classes.\"\"Exactly. But Ancient Inheritances are not so easy to get. Not only do you need to track down the Inheritance token, but you have to spend your Awakening points to acquire it. Everyone starts with three Awakening points that they can spend to change classes if they don't like their class. But, to acquire an Ancient Inheritance, you have to spend a number of Awakening points equal to the number of categories the class contains. \"Actually, acquiring an Ancient Inheritance can happen in a couple of different ways, but the only reliable way is to find an altar of power that aligns with the Ancient Inheritance and tap into its energy while you spend the Awakening points. However, altars of power almost always have a very difficult challenge that you have to overcome in order to receive the altar spirit's blessing.\"That challenge could be anything from a specific quest to beating the spirit in combat, depending on what sort of class the Ancient Inheritance token holds. But for the most part, they are very difficult to accomplish, even if the inheritance is 'just' a production or support class. If you manage to get through the challenge, then the altar spirit will grant you the Awakening, and you can assume the class contained in the Ancient Inheritance token.\"But don't underestimate the difficulty of the Awakening quests. In fact, they are so hard that most players who find an Inheritance token end up selling them to one of the major guilds since it is practically impossible to fulfill the requirements for Awakening the Ancient Inheritance without a massive amount of resources and support. A lot of people will end up giving the token to a guild in exchange for a dual category class that doesn't require any unlocking.\"\"But doesn't that mean they miss the extra buffs that come with an Ancient Inheritance?\" asked Thorn with a frown.\"Yeah, but better to miss the extra passives than be unable to use the class at all,\" replied Ouroboros. \"What good is a class that you can't play?\"\"I guess that makes sense,\" said Thorn, nodding. Fascinated by everything he was learning, Thorn continued to talk with Ouroboros late into the night. Eventually, the conversation wound down, and Ouroboros, Mina, and Velin said good night and logged off, leaving Thorn to head back to the room he had rented.The next morning, Thorn got up early, his mind buzzing with excitement. Everything he had learned the night before had inspired him to get an amazing class so he could join the ranks of the elite players. Countless plans rushed through his head, making it impossible for him to sleep.He had agreed to meet up with the others in three days, as there were a few things they had to handle in the real world, so Thorn spent a while trying to decide how to fill his time. From what Ouroboros had said, the two most important elements of the game were mastering a weapon and being able to adapt to a fight on your opponent's home terrain.Almost every class used some sort of weapon, and Nova Terra's primary occupation was violence. Close to 80% of the quests seemed to include some sort of armed conflict, making weapon handling a vital part of the game. Even production classes that were often trying to avoid combat came with specialized weapons that matched their occupation.As for being able to adapt to your opponent's home terrain, that was common sense. Because most of the quests had the player going to a new area to fight, collect, or investigate, and those areas were almost all occupied by hostiles, it made complete sense that being able to adjust to the specifics of the area was important.While there were countless other things for Thorn to work on that had been mentioned last night, these two were the ones that Thorn thought were the most immediately applicable to improving his own situation. And armor. Remembering his mental note to pick up some armor so he didn't look like a complete noob, Thorn decided to make that his first stop this morning.", "\"Good morn...\" Calling out as he heard the bell on his shop door ring, the shopkeeper trailed off in shock as Thorn's massive bulk squeezed through the door. Ducking to avoid dragging his head on the eight-foot ceiling, Thorn's huge body took up most of the small store.\"Morning. I heard you carry custom armor,\" said Thorn, looking around at the leather and chainmail adorning the various mannequins.\"Uh..yeah...Yes! Yes, I do. For uh...for all shapes and...uh...sizes,\" stammered the shopkeeper, still trying to process the giant who was squeezed into his shop.\"Excellent. I'd like to get some armor!\" said Thorn, in his most chipper tone, mentally shaking his head. He had no idea why his height was such a barrier to conversation for people.\"O..okay. Let me take some measurements, and while I do that, we can talk about what sort of armor you are looking for.\" The shopkeeper's merchant side finally kicked in when he heard Thorn wanted to purchase some armor, and he was able to get his wits about him. \"Do you have any thoughts on what sort of style and material you are looking for?\"Um...hmmm...\" now it was Thorn's turn to hem and haw.\"Why don't I give you a brief introduction to the kinds of armor,\" said the shopkeeper, to Thorn's relief.Almost three hours later, Thorn stepped out of the shop, his wallet a whole six gold lighter. Still, Thorn was happy. After discussing all of the options, Thorn finally agreed to get a custom-made leather armor with a scale covering on the torso, thighs, and upper arm. According to the shopkeeper, scale armor, which was made of many overlapping metal scales, was great at defending against both piercing and blunt force attacks but lacked some of the flexibility of chain or leather. Because flexibility was important to Thorn, they had decided on a very fine chainmail at the armor's joints and a hardened leather everywhere else. After looking over multiple designs, Thorn had rejected all of the pauldrons and had settled on shaped metal plates to guard the shoulders, forearms, and calves. Most sets of armor used pauldrons to increase the profile of the wearer, but that was the last thing Thorn needed.Having settled his bill and agreeing to come back to pick up his new armor in a few days, Thorn headed for the Training Hall. He hadn't been back since his first visit, but he thought that it was time to pick a weapon and get some practical in-game training. The last few weeks of fighting corrupted wolves had broken him of the assumption that his martial arts training could be applied as he knew it.Almost every one of the fights he engaged in devolved into him swinging his sword as fast and hard as he could or simple punches and kicks. He learned that all the blocking, special stances, footwork, and the like, went right out the window when a large, slavering monster was trying its best to bite your head off.While Thorn had pretty much mastered the basics of the sword, saber, and spear, what he knew were vague concepts and forms. Not actual combat. Remembering a time when he was fighting three wolves and his sword had gotten stuck in the first wolf he had stabbed, resulting in three savage bite wounds, Thorn grimaced. He had resolved that fight by ripping the last wolf in half, but it had been a close call.Watching the ease and fluidity of Ouroboros' fights had reinforced the idea that Thorn's fighting style had a glaring problem. Ouroboros used a shield and sword, but it was often hard to tell which was for defense and which was for offense. He was able to adjust to the situation, blocking blows from either side with ease and striking out at impossible angles to cut down his foes before they could even approach. Before watching Ouroboros, Thorn had been feeling that he was pretty good at combat, but it took only a few minutes to realize that he wouldn't last more than a few moves against the Holy Guardian. Not only did he lack practical fighting experience, but Thorn realized that his size would actually be a major hindrance in a fight against someone who was more skilled than he was. In order to maximize his power, Thorn had to maintain a specific distance, and once his opponent had stepped inside that distance, the best he could do was frenzied grappling. This was by no means a problem unique to himself; however, his increased size magnified it.Getting to the door of the Training Hall, Thorn was a little taken aback when it opened to reveal a glaring elf, Janus Fairgoode. Unbeknownst to Thorn, the projectiles trainer had fought with all the other trainers for the right to take Thorn as a student. \"Where have you been?\" she barked, reaching out to latch on to Thorn's shirt.Instinctively, he slapped her hand down and stepped back into his stance before rubbing his head. \"Sorry, sorry. I've been out hunting to get money to pay for lessons,\" Thorn said, standing and bowing his head.\"Hmph, that's more like it,\" Janus said, her angry eyes lighting up when she heard the word money. \"Come on in.\"Heading into the empty hall, Janus led Thorn to a corner where bows of all shapes and sizes rested in racks along the wall. Large quivers of arrows stood at various stations, ready to be sent downrange to the straw targets against the opposite wall. \"So have you decided if you want to learn thrown weapons or archery first?\"\"Well, I was actually hoping to ask you,\" replied Thorn, putting on as humble a look as he could. \"I am trying to figure out what would be the best weapon for me to learn, but I'm not able to decide.\"\"Yeah, you are something of a puzzle,\" Janus admitted, looking him over.\"Hey, kid. Welcome back,\" interrupted Hamm, who had walked in beside Dovon, the dwarf who taught grappling. Ignoring Janus, who was glaring at him, Hamm looked at Thorn. \"Looks like you haven't met Master Sun yet. Or did he reject you?\"\"No,\" replied Thorn, shaking his head in embarrassment, \"I actually forgot about finding him.\"\"Eh, that actually works out. I found out that he is out traveling, so you wouldn't have been able to meet him anyway,\" said Hamm, unconcerned that he had sent Thorn on a wild goose chase. \"I heard you tell Janus that you are here to find a good weapon, huh?\"\"Yeah, he came to me to ask about what he should learn,\" said Janus before Thorn could respond. \"Me. Not you. So leave us alone, old man. I'm trying to instruct my student.\"\"Old man, huh?\" said Hamm, a belligerent light in his eyes. \"How about this 'old man' gives you some instruction?\"Ignoring the two bickering trainers, Dovon stepped up to Thorn and tried to pat his back. However, because of their height difference, the best he could do was to pat Thorn's upper thigh. Seeing how defeated the dwarf felt, Thorn felt bad, so he repeated his question from earlier.\"Sir, I'm trying to figure out what weapon I should use going forward. Do you have any suggestions?\"\"Actually,\" Dovon chewed his pipe for a moment before spitting on the floor. \"We've been tryin' ta figure that out ourselves. Ever since ya first stopped by, there has been a constant debate 'bout what would suit ya best.\"\"It's true.\" Turning away from Hamm, Janus sat on one of the archery racks. \"Your strength is out of this world and your flexibility is astounding for someone your size. Couple that with inhuman reaction speeds, and you are literally built for combat. The problem is, what sort of combat?\"\"That's right,\" said Hamm, taking over the conversation. \"You are not suited for finesse-based weapons, which puts most blades out. It also rules out hidden weapons like darts and daggers, short blades, and stuff like that. Spears and polearms are out since they would have to be ridiculously oversized to work for you, which would impact their adaptability. Axes and lances are in the same boat as spears, and the more esoteric weapons are bad anyway.\"\"Esoteric weapons?\"\"Yeah, stuff like chains, whips, scythes, you know.\"\"Does that mean that you can't offer me any training?\" asked Thorn with a frown.\"No, no. We are happy to train you in any weapon, so long as you pay for the course. What I am talking about are weapons that you are unlikely to be able to master because of your physical condition and the limitations of your environment. Take swords, for example. You already have a great sword form and are a passable swordsman. However, it is unlikely you will ever get better for a very simple reason.\" Hamm paused for dramatic effect.\"You are too strong,\" cut in Janus, stealing Hamm's thunder.\"Too strong? This is the first time I've heard of strength being bad,\" mumbled Thorn.\"Of course strength is not bad,\" said Hamm, glaring at the slim elf who had interrupted him. \"But your level of strength makes it impossible for you to cut with a sword the way you are supposed to. A slash from you doesn't focus on the power of the sword, which is the ability of the edge to cut. Instead, your strength turns every blow into blunt force, smashing through anything that resists. Remember that sword you borrowed? The thing was ruined by the time you brought it back. After all, swords are not meant to be hit against metal, or even bone. They are designed to cut soft tissue and cause bleeding. But when they enter your hands, they end up being no different than a metal stick.\"\"Okay, that makes sense,\" said Thorn, scratching his head. \"Do you have a recommendation for me?\"\"Grappling!\"\"Archery!\"\"Rods!\"Shouting out their answers together, Dovon, Janus, and Hamm glared at each other. Seeing they were about to break into another argument, Thorn jumped in.\"Sounds great! Where do I pay?\"\"You want to do all three?\" Janus asked, separating herself from the squabbling men.\"Yeah, they all seem pretty interesting, so why not give them all a try?\"\"Excellent. You can start with archery,\" said Janus, rubbing her hands together. \"What level of training would you like? The cost is 10 silver every three days for basic training, 50 silver for intermediate and 1 gold for advanced.\"\"Umm, let's start with basic training for now. I've never shot a bow before.\"\"Sure. That will be 10 silver.\" Janus held out her hand.After paying, Thorn spent the next few hours getting a detailed lesson in the different types of bows that were available in Nova Terra. There were longbows, short bows, long recurve bows, short recurve bows, compound bows, composite bows, crossbows, and the list went on and on. Thorn had assumed that Janus would push him toward the longbows, since she was an elf, but was soon surprised when she pulled out a massive, cloth-covered bundle from behind one of the racks.\"Here, open this up,\" she said, giving the bundle a kick.Unwrapping the thick blankets, Thorn saw a thick metal bow mounted with bolts to an ash-colored frame as thick as his arm.\"Is this a crossbow?\" he asked.\"Crossbow? Ha, no way. This is an arbalest! Do you know what the difference is? It is in the bow. See how it is made out of metal? That makes the arbalest much stronger, though it is generally considered unwieldy, since it is so much heavier and harder to draw. However, that shouldn't be an issue for you.\"Picking up the arbalest according to Janus' instructions, Thorn soon learned its basic usage. Like a crossbow, the arbalest included a basic winding mechanical structure that assisted the user in drawing back the string. There was also a simple release mechanism to allow the user to fire with a trigger, much like a rifle. Winding was rather tedious, however, so Thorn soon resorted to pulling back the string with his hands, finding it much easier and quite a bit quicker.Bolts were loaded into the flight groove after the string had been pulled back and shot with considerable force down range. After playing around with the arbalest for a bit, Thorn was rather pleased to see that he could hit the target at 50 meters most of the time. Six out of ten shots might not seem like much at first, but considering that this was his first time, he was pleased. Janus, however, was not pleased at all and set out a strict shooting practice routine for his next two days.Since Ouroboros and the gang had sent him an in-game message to let him know that they would be tied up for a few more days than expected with a guild activity, Thorn applied himself to Janus' training with as much enthusiasm as he could muster. The arbalest was fun to shoot, and Thorn found himself immersed in the training routines. Fire while standing still, fire while moving, fire while prone, turn and fire, reloading from a quiver, reloading from bolts on the ground, moving and reloading. Over the three days of training, Thorn felt like they covered every possible situation. As he fired bolt after bolt after bolt, Thorn started to understand the mechanics of the arbalest, and his accuracy crept up. There was no astounding breakthrough or magic assistance, which almost made him wonder if this was still a game, but he did get more accurate as time progressed. Soon he was hitting all of his shots from 50 meters when standing still and at least 6 out of 10 when moving. Farther than that and his accuracy dropped, but Janus said that was because of the strength of the bow and its smaller powerstroke. After finishing up his last exercise on the third day, Thorn bowed to Janus and was about to ask for the intermediate training, when Hamm jumped in front of him and started yelling.\"No, no, no! You stupid kid! You've wasted too much time on this lame arrow stuff!\"\"Lame arrow stuff?!\" Janus' eyes narrowed and a shortbow seemed to appear in her hands. \"How about I show you how stupid it is?\"\"Yeah, stupid! Whoa, wait, I mean...\" Hamm, still facing Thorn, felt a cold chill run down his spine and glanced back to see Janus pulling out an arrow from a quiver on the floor. \"Hey, w...wait a second,\" he stammered, putting up his hands and backing away.\"What are you backing away for, Hamm?\" \"Hey, no need for that. Why don't we talk this out?\" said Hamm, backing up faster.\"Talk it out with this!\" yelled Janus, drawing her bow and sending an arrow flying at Hamm, who dodged with a diving roll.\u00a0", "Dumbfounded, Thorn could only watch as Janus began shooting arrow after arrow at the dodging Hamm, who seemed to get out of the way of each of them. Some were so close that his leather armor was nicked! Standing there staring, Thorn felt a tug on his arm. Looking down, he saw the pipe-smoking dwarf, Dovon, standing next to him.\"Hey'a, boy. Why don't we take this chance to get some grappling training in?\" said the dwarf, chewing on his pipe.Throwing a bemused glance at the elven archery master who was still making Hamm dance, Thorn nodded. Might as well train at something else since she was occupied. Thorn followed Dovon to a different part of the large training hall, handed over his 10 silver, and sat down on the ground. Even sitting, Thorn towered over the four-foot tall dwarf, but at least their heads were in closer proximity.\"Alright, boy, let's chat about grappling. Grappling is the art of grabbing on to someone and hurting them or restraining them through the use of technical grappling techniques. However, we are going to simplify it since you have some background in martial arts, and your body isn't suited for the technical stuff, anyway. We are going to break this down into a couple categories, some of which we will cover, some not.\"First, we have ranged striking. This is any punches or kicks from a distance without direct body contact. We will not be covering this since you have a pretty solid striking foundation, and grappling focuses more on body contact. That is, what to do once you have made contact with an enemy.\"Second, we'll look at close contact striking. How do you strike someone after contact is made? This is going to be our main focus and will take up most of our training. We'll talk about three different things: Indexing, Control, and the basic starts. Then we'll drill those until you puke!\"Last, but not least, we'll go over some actual grappling since that is what this course is called, and we should cover what happens when you are too close to strike. How does that sound?\" As he finished speaking, Dovon lifted his left leg, a quivering arrow stabbing into the floor where his foot had been moments ago!\"Okay, let's talk about the basics.\" Completely ignoring the fuming elf across the room, Dovon resumed his teaching without missing a beat. \"What I am going to teach you are the foundations of how to wreck your enemy with your hands and feet once you are within arms reach. We'll spend the first two days on close contact striking, and then we'll deal with how you will incorporate grappling into your combat routine.\"Standing across from Thorn, who was still sitting on the ground, Dovon stood in a relaxed position, his feet less than shoulder width apart and his hands resting by his side.\"This is the basic position we will work from. We call it, 'you should have been prepared but you aren't and now you are in a fight' or 'roll initiative' for short.\" Dovon paused for a moment to chuckle at his own joke. \"From here your goal is to get to a combat-ready state as fast as possible. There are three possible positions. Passive, which is where we are. Reactive, which is where we will be when we flinch. And active, which is when we attack or block. Passive is useless, reactive is good, but more often bad, and active is where we want to be.\"So, if you are in a passive position, and you see something coming, your natural reaction will be to recoil in some fashion. You want to get through that recoil as fast as possible without obstructing your ability to follow up with a useful action. Got it? We'll be drilling it until you don't even realize you are doing it. Next, we are going to cover indexing, which is how you target.\"Waving to a human who was watching from the side, Dovon pulled him in front of Thorn.\"This is Sam. He is going to help me demonstrate the next couple of things.\" Turning to the man, Dovon nodded. \"Sam, try to hit me.\"Squaring up his shoulders, Sam started blasting out punches toward Dovon, who bobbed and wove with ease, sliding past the punches like he could see them coming a mile away. Holding up a hand to stop Sam, Dovon grabbed Sam's left hand and put it on his chest. When Dovon nodded at him to start swinging again, Thorn was surprised to see that no matter how he moved, Dovon was unable to get away from Sam's punches, forcing him to block them with his hands to avoid getting his face battered.\"Okay, enough, enough,\" grumbled Dovon after Sam threw ten blows. \"I swear that is his favorite part of working here. Anyway, did you see what happened as soon as we made contact? Once he had his hand on me, no matter how I move, his body is able to adjust his blow even after he has thrown it to hit me. This is because the point of contact provides more information than his eyes do. The combination of visual clues and tactile clues allow him to react to my attempts to get away. \"This is called indexing and forms the first rule of unarmed combat. 'If you can put a hand on your enemy, do.' The second rule comes from what we call controlling, which encompasses the way you create angles and bypass obstructions. The second rule can be stated as, 'The fewer things between you and your enemy, the better.' Okay, so we have indexing and controlling. This brings us to the last of the basic rules.\"Rule three: 'If what you are doing is working, keep doing it.' Now, this sounds like a basic thing, but you would be astounded at how many martial arts muck about trying to add variety to a very simple thing. If you hit your enemy, and they miss the block, hit them again. If you kick, and they buckle but don't go down, kick them again. Hell, if they do go down, kick them again anyway. We only switch our method when we have to.\"Alright, enough of me jabbering. Get on your feet, and we'll start going through the drills.\" Dovon set up a circular ring and then pulled a large humanoid training dummy from near the wall. Thorn had previously seen various players sparring against the dummies, which could move like a regular person. Dovon equipped the training dummy with punching mitts and keyed in some commands. Standing across from the dummy in the 'roll initiative' position, Thorn started practicing his reaction drills. Closing his eyes, he waited for the dummy to give him a sharp push on his chest before opening his eyes, trying to recover his balance, and striking the training dummy's punching mitt, which was held in a different position each time. After this, Dovon had him begin full contact sparring with the training dummy, focusing on indexing, control, and successive strikes. At first, Thorn was knocking out the training dummies with a single blow, but Dovon soon adjusted their threshold for force, causing them to ignore all but the strongest hits. After a bit of tweaking, Thorn could only knock them out after three or four hits, which caused him to ramp up his strike's power. This continued until he was once again knocking each training dummy out in a hit or two.Dovon, for his part, was ecstatic to have such a strong student. In fact, he got so excited that he spent all three days teaching and drilling Thorn on his close contact striking abilities. When Thorn tried to ask about grappling, Dovon looked at him and said in a completely serious voice, \"Just grab them and rip their arm off.\"Thorn was confused until one of the training dummies lost its head from an off-target punch, the sheer force of his blow twisting the head right off. Toward the end of the three days, Dovon started armoring the training dummies with metal armor and giving them weapons. Thorn was given bracers and metal gloves to defend himself, but the sheer force of his blows turned his steel covered fists into pile drivers, smashing the training dummies to pieces. Finally, his training was over, and Thorn bowed to his dwarven trainer, who was doing his best to keep a massive grin off of his face. \"Thank you, sir. I learned a lot about practical combat over the last three days. I'll put it to good use,\" said Thorn as he bowed.\"Haha, of course, kid. I've got plenty more, so come back when you want to learn something else. But you better go talk to Janus before she shoots us full of holes,\" Dovon said, gesturing to the slim elf lurking in the background with a throwing knife dancing across her fingers.After placating Janus with a promise that he would continue to practice shooting, Thorn looked for Hamm but was told that he had gone out and was expected to be gone for a week. This seemed to be common, and the players did not seem to mind one bit. Then again, players could speed up time by logging out, so the NPCs being away did not bother them. Thorn didn't have that luxury, so he decided to pick up his old standby and go hunt some corrupted wolves.After, of course, a shopping trip. The sword that Thorn had used on his first hunting trip had been returned and melted down for scrap. He had a machete that he was using as a knife, but Thorn lacked a ranged weapon and something to protect his hands, so he decided to go browse the weapon shops. Thorn's first stop was the armorer he had commissioned to make his custom fit scale armor. The shopkeeper had sent word to the inn where he was staying that morning, letting him know that the armor had been completed as ordered. When he got to the store, the excited shopkeeper took him to the back room, where he got changed. The shopkeeper had also made a set of clothing for underneath the armor, so Thorn did not have to put it on over his beginner's clothes.Once dressed, Thorn admired the sleek scale armor in a floor length mirror that showed up to his chest. Dark brown leather with hardened reinforcements gave the armor an earthy tone, complemented by the hardened steel scales on the chest piece. With the shopkeeper's recommendation, Thorn had the scales treated with a matte brown varnish that kept them from shining, for stealth's sake. Two tight pauldrons gave some protection on the shoulder while the metal bracers and shin guards were treated with the same varnish as the scales, as were the chainmail guards at the joints. The black underclothes contrasted well with the brown armor, offset by some dark green stitching and dark green leather belts that crossed his chest and wrapped around his waist. Out of the unflattering beginner clothing, Thorn presented a rather dashing picture. After admiring himself in the mirror for a few more minutes, Thorn thanked the shopkeeper and went off to find some weapons for his hunt.As Thorn walked down the wide street in Berum, he noticed a lot more people glancing his way. He wasn't sure if it was the new armor or the training he had gotten, but he was feeling much more confident, and that confidence was reflected in his walk. Where players and NPCs paid him little attention before, they now moved out of his way or looked twice. His skin was pretty thick, so the extra attention did not bother him.The bow store that Janus had recommended turned out not to be a bow store at all. Rather, it was a mercenary resupply store that sold everything a mercenary corps might need. Thorn saw everything from basic camping equipment for individual mercenaries to massive stew pots and 'e-z-build bunk beds' for managing a whole company. Weapons could be bought individually or ordered in bulk. After telling the gawking clerk that he was going to look around, Thorn browsed through the extensive weapons section. There were a number of bows and crossbows, but what caught his eye were the 'City Defense 800' series of arbalests. Designed to be mounted on a wall or a cart, the City Defense series was halfway between an arbalest and a ballista. With a five foot lath, the crossbow was too unwieldy for the average person to handle on foot. By fixing it on a cart or city wall, a mercenary corps could increase the threat range of their warriors. An average arbalest was lucky if it had a 100-meter range with any degree of accuracy due to the shorter Powerstroke, but the City Defender tripled that by increasing the size of the lath and lengthening the flight groove.Priced at 4 gold apiece, the City Defender 800 Series was not cheap, but looking at it gave Thorn all sorts of crazy ideas. Finding a shopkeeper, he purchased the City Defender and had them pack it up, asking for directions to the nearest weaponsmith. While the City Defender suited his size, it lacked a proper handle, and the whole winding mechanism was in the way.Before Thorn left, he also purchased three hundred bolts for the arbalest, making the shopkeeper wonder if he was about to declare war on someone. The weaponsmith, located in the western Forge District, agreed to modify the massive crossbow for Thorn. Removing the mounting point and all of the mechanical parts of the winding system, he attached a metal stock, laid down a metal slide in the flight groove to reduce friction and wear and tear, and reinforced the trigger system. The resulting crossbow was simplified and stripped down.While he was there, Thorn asked about some sort of auto-loading mechanism like the ones he had seen on some of the other crossbows that were for sale but was told that most of them were more of a gimmick than anything else. By including an automatic fire system, a crossbow sacrificed both range and power to increase fire speed. Since it took Thorn almost no effort to draw the string of his crossbow, it was not worth the sacrifice in range and power, so Thorn put the thought out of his mind. Once his crossbow was done, Thorn was left with a bit less than 1 gold to his name, so he decided to skip getting any gauntlets, for the time being.He still had his knife for close combat, and with his armor, Thorn was confident that even if the corrupted wolves closed the distance with him, he would be able to defend himself even better than the last time he hunted them. Thinking about how he often had to rest after each tussle, Thorn vowed that, this time, he wouldn't allow them even that victory.\u00a0\u00a0", "Restocked and ready to go, Thorn returned to his room for a good night's sleep. Early the next morning, he took up his crossbow and left by the North Gate. Walking through the quiet, early morning streets, Thorn breathed in the chilly air. Since coming to Nova Terra, Thorn had been learning of countless experiences that he had missed in the real world due to his physical condition.Walking in the early morning stillness was one of the things he'd missed out on, and as he did, Thorn couldn't help but feel grateful for the ability to walk and move as he wanted. The feeling of striding through the bracing morning air, the promise of light peeking over the horizon, caused something amazing to bubble up in his chest. It was an excitement that was foreign to him but that he was feeling more and more the longer he stayed in this special world.It didn't take long for the sun to rise, and by the time it did, Thorn had reached the edge of the old growth forest where he had spent three weeks hunting corrupted wolves. With a deep breath, Thorn readied his crossbow and stepped into the forest.By this point, Thorn had a good idea of where the corrupted wolves hunted, so he headed in that direction. However, he had hardly gone more than 100 meters when he saw a corrupted wolf patrol stalking off to his left. Stunned that they were ranging so close to the edge of the forest, Thorn squatted and loaded his crossbow.Sighting down the flight groove at the lead wolf, Thorn took a deep breath in and then let it out, pulling the trigger when his body settled, like Janus had taught him. With a loud twang and a woosh, the bolt flew out of the crossbow toward the lead wolf! The bolt traveled so fast the corrupted wolf didn't even have time to flinch before a tree behind it exploded into splinters!Cursing under his breath at the missed shot, Thorn hurried to reload. He had expected the bolt to drop off at this distance, the same way a regular arbalest would, but the City Defender was rated for a much longer range, a fact he had completely forgotten in his excitement. Berating himself for not test-firing his new crossbow, Thorn loaded his next bolt and sighted at the wolves that were now scrambling away.Before he could pull the trigger, the corrupted wolves had disappeared over a hill, so Thorn reluctantly disengaged his crossbow and jogged over to the tree. At first, he was unable to find the bolt that he had shot out, but after hunting around, Thorn found it almost completely buried in the hill behind the splintered ruins of the tree.Wondering if there would be anything left of the corrupted wolves to collect if he had hit them instead of the tree, Thorn pulled the bolt out of the hill. After inspecting it for damage, he resumed his hunting.After three more experiences that were almost exact repeats of the first miss, Thorn decided to give up for the day. Completely dejected over his inability to hit anything apart from trees, Thorn left the forest and headed back to town. Going to the Training Hall to see Janus, he described his issue and paid a silver to use their targets for some practice.Janus, tickled pink by his story, told him to practice well and was about to leave when Thorn pulled out his massive crossbow. Stunned by the sheer size of the device, Janus hurried over and forbade Thorn from firing it inside the hall. Taking him outside to the training yard, she set up some targets at fifty, one hundred, one hundred and fifty, and two hundred meters for him to practice.Slowly but surely, Thorn started to get used to the massive crossbow, and by the hundredth bolt, he was back up to his sixty percent accuracy. In fact, due to the increased power of the City Defender, Thorn's accuracy actually rose to eighty percent within 200 meters, as long as he was standing still. After half a day of practice, he was feeling pretty good about it, so he decided to try hunting again the next night. It was a good thing the bolts were reusable; otherwise, Thorn did not know if he would have been able to afford shooting the enormous weapon.Double-checking to make sure the bounty on the corrupted wolves was still active, Thorn spent a bit of time browsing through the other tasks. Not finding anything that looked particularly interesting, he was about to head back to the inn when he got a message notification from Ouroboros. It had been about a week since he had heard from Ouroboros or the rest of the group. Thorn smiled after reading the message. When he had first met Ouroboros and the gang, they had been pretty cold, but as they had spent time together, Ouroboros had warmed up. About to send a reply, another beep notified Thorn that he had another message from Ouroboros. Excited, Thorn sent a reply and then headed toward the inn. The next morning, Thorn set out once again to try and see if he could do better than the embarrassment that was his last attempt at hunting corrupted wolves.Entering the forest at the same spot, Thorn once again saw a group of corrupted wolves almost as soon as he walked into the trees. Brow furrowed, Thorn couldn't think of a good reason for the corrupted wolves to be ranging this far out from their valley. He could, however, think of a bad reason.The corrupted wolves reproduced faster than regular wolves, as the corruption increased their growth rate. The only reason Thorn could think of for them to push out this far would be that their numbers had increased to the point that the valley could no longer sustain them. If that was the case, then Berum was about to be in a lot of trouble.If the valley was no longer able to support the number of corrupted wolves, then they would soon erupt into a massive tide in a bid to get more space and control more territory. These tides were dangerous affairs, less so for the players (who could leave), but devastating for the NPCs in the area.For a brief moment, Thorn considered going back and reporting that the corrupted wolves had pushed past their normal boundaries, but he decided against it. Maybe he was being pessimistic. Even if the corrupted wolves were pushing out of the valley, it wasn't bad enough for a beast tide to develop.Loading up his crossbow, he decided to head toward the valley to see if he could get a glimpse of the situation there. Breathing out, he settled his aim and pulled the trigger, praying to every god who might be listening to him. If he missed like yesterday, he might die from the embarrassment.To his great joy, it seemed the gods were listening and his bolt smashed through the lead corrupted wolf with ease, cutting it in two. The bolt landed below the beast's rib cage and smashed through its spine, sending its back legs spinning through the air.In complete shock, the other two corrupted wolves froze for the briefest of moments before they looked around, the blood of their companion driving them to a frenzy. Spotting Thorn, they lunged toward him, howling as they rushed forward.Mentally grinning at the sight of the corrupted wolf being blown into the air by the force of the bolt, Thorn reloaded and leveled the City Defender again. \"Their bloodlust makes them stupid,\" thought Thorn as he watched the other two corrupted wolves rushing toward him. \"Enough time for one more shot.\" He calculated, calming his racing heart. Luckily, his second bolt hit as well, sending another corrupted wolf tumbling to the ground, lifeless.Gauging the distance between the last corrupted wolf and himself, Thorn knew he wouldn't be able to reload in time. Placing the City Defender on the ground, Thorn pulled out his knife and stepped forward to meet the charging beast.-------------------In another part of Nova Terra, a grizzled old man cackled to himself. He had finally finished his project, years in the making: a diabolically designed series of updates and events that would create a new age of mayhem all across Nova Terra! Smirking to himself, he was so caught up in imagining the coming chaos that he failed to notice the woman standing behind him.Pretty, but by no means a stunner, the woman was of medium height and had soft brown hair. Her brown eyes sparkled with intelligence, and her small, well-formed mouth made a charming and comforting picture. Yet, at the moment, a deep scowl marred her features as she stared at the back of the oblivious old man.Joseph McCallen, mastermind and creator of Nova Terra, had long since lost interest in any of the business of his company and instead devoted himself fulltime to... improving... Nova Terra. What did they call it when he was young? Oh yeah, trolling. Excitement bubbled up as he thought of all of the changes he had made to the game with this update, especially to the boss monsters. Unable to suppress the cackle that bubbled up, he laughed sinisterly to himself until a disapproving cough alerted him to the young woman's presence.Turning to find the brown-haired young lady behind him, Joseph wiped the evil smile from his face and looked all business.\"E-hem. Yes. Oh, hello, Eve. Just finishing up a small update to Nova Terra's new expansion. You know, tweaking some bosses, improving some events. Small things really.\" As he said it, he slid his hand behind his back and mashed the enter button, hoping to deploy his changes before she could stop him. Unfortunately, the enter button did nothing, as Eve had disabled his keyboard.\"Please, Joseph, give it up already. I've had this space isolated for at least six months.\" Eve rolled her eyes as she walked over to the console to see what he had been doing. \"I've worked hard to balance this game, and I'm not about to let you destroy years and years of work! It has taken almost 10 years to get the game to the point where it isn't a giant hot mess.\"Groaning with frustration at his failed attempt to slip the update in without Eve knowing about it, Joseph threw himself down in a chair, complaining all the while. \"But, Eve, the game is so boring. The scheduled update is more of the same old boring crap! Go here, do that, collect 300,000 whatchamacallits! There is no chaos, no spice. Everything is so...orderly! Where are the dragons? Where are the princesses that need to be saved? Where are the gladiators who rise up to become kings by slaughtering all before them?!\"\"I don't know how you make order sound like an insult,\" remarked Eve, back to her whining creator as she double-checked all of his changes. \"Plus, the update going out tomorrow has been approved by the board and is anticipated by the players. There is nothing wrong with it.\"\"Bah! Forget the board. Those idiots wouldn't know a good game if it spits in their faces. The whole thing is dry as a bone. More of the same quests, no real progression. Nothing worthwhile.\"\"How can there be progression,\" Eve said, \"when no one has managed to even unlock the global quest line yet? There are a couple of teams that are close, but no player has gotten to level three in their bloodline yet. These things take time.\"\"That is exactly what I am talking about!\" raged Joseph. \"Those so-called 'top players' are running around like chickens with their heads cut off, with nothing to show for it. I mean, how hard can it be? But not even one of the four billion players has even mastered their second class!\"\"Please,\" snapped Eve, \"you know how hard it is. You designed that fiasco of a quest. The requirements for each level are inhuman. It is a miracle that anyone has even mastered a single category class!\"\"Hmph. That means they are terrible,\" said Joseph.\"Still, many of these changes could be interesting,\" said Eve, changing the subject when she saw Joseph had stopped his ranting and settled into depression. She jerked in shock, glaring at the old man. \"What is this?! You raised all the unique bosses' ranks and increased their intelligence, as well.\"\"Haha, yeah!\" Joseph jumped to his feet and pointed excitedly at the screen. \"Don't you see what is missing from Nova Terra? This is it! Evil! Real evil, real bad guys! With this, players will have to make choices; they will have to suffer if they want to succeed! No more happy days without a challenge. No more 'evil villains' who stay in their castles and wait for the heroes to come and slay them. No! It is time for evil to rise and corruption to spread! Only then will the true heroes rise!\"Looking at the excited look on Joseph's face, Eve could only shake her head. It had been years since Joseph had shown this much enthusiasm for something, and that alone was enough for her. Massive amounts of data ran through her head at lightning speed as she processed the possible permutations of the changes Joseph's update made. Seeing that Eve was processing, Joseph sat, a small smile on his face.\"Okay, boss, let's do it!\" Eve's eyes snapped open after a few minutes. \"I'll monitor to maintain balance, but why not see where it takes us!\" she said, giggling. Turning, she removed her block and pointed toward the enter button. With a triumphant smile and a grand flourish, Joseph pushed the button. The world changed.All across Nova Terra, players saw the announcement. Monsters everywhere shivered and then continued on their paths, but with strengthened steps and new vigor.In a dark castle, deep in the northern reaches, a frost-covered gauntlet clenched, and with a snapping sound, broke free of the ice. The March of the Dead began.In a burning desert, a monstrous red-skinned Ogre looked around with new purpose, roaring out commands to his horde. The Red Scourge marched for war!In a deep cave, in a quiet forest, a vicious werewolf licked its lips as its snout picked up the scent of a tasty treat not too far from the cave. Quick as a shadow, it loped out after it. The Black Moon rose.", "Thorn was currently in combat, so the notification of the update was muted. Even if it hadn't been, he would have missed it, as all of his focus was fixed on the corrupted wolf currently charging him. Extending his left hand out, his fingers spread, Thorn waited for the corrupted wolf to start its leaping pounce before moving.Taking a big step toward the jumping wolf, Thorn's massive hand smashed toward its snout. The blow would have sent the wolf tumbling back if he hadn't followed up with a lightning fast stab, guiding his knife into the wolf's neck. Black blood spurted from the wound, and the wolf dropped to the forest floor like a limp rag.Collecting the two bolts he had shot before, Thorn spent a moment cleaning them off before he started hunting again. Soon he fell into a steady rhythm. Shooting the first wolf and the second, and then applying his new close combat techniques to take down the third. Like this, he pushed deeper and deeper into the old growth forest.The deeper he got, the closer together the corrupted wolf patrols became, making it more and more difficult to only engage a single patrol at a time. Deciding to change his tactics a bit, Thorn found a good defensive spot with two large trees that were close together. Looking around, he found a large boulder that he rolled over to the trees. Propping it up against the two trees, Thorn created a natural wall against which he could put his back.With his new-found confidence, Thorn wasn't worried about facing large numbers of corrupted wolves, so long as they could not surround him. After all, while he was a pretty skilled martial artist, he did not have eyes in the back of his head. Taking a moment to settle himself, Thorn stuck six bolts in the ground next to him and loaded his arbalest. With a deep breath, he sighted at the group of corrupted wolves that was farthest away.It was a long shot at more than 200 meters, and Thorn had no expectation of hitting them, but he sighted his crossbow and released a shot. With a harsh whistle, the bolt flew through the air, covering the distance in a bit over a second. Missing the corrupted wolf that Thorn had aimed at, the bolt impacted the ground right in between two wolves, showering them with dirt debris from the forest floor.Without waiting to see the result of his shot, Thorn reloaded and aimed at the next closest group that had turned to look behind at the commotion. Squeezing off the second shot, Thorn was a little luckier this time and caught a corrupted wolf in the shoulder, causing it to explode in a shower of blood and gore. Fortunately, the rest of the corrupted wolves had not spotted him yet, so he reloaded his arbalest again, sending another massive bolt into the crowding wolves looking for the source of their trouble.Apart from the one he had killed, three groups of wolves gathered at the sound of the bolts. With eight corrupted wolves milling about, it was almost a miracle that Thorn missed his third shot, the bolt flying between two wolves and smashing into the ground. The impact did knock a corrupted wolf off its feet, but the other seven wolves immediately turned to look at Thorn, their blood red eyes locking on him.Feeling the increased pressure from their savage attention, Thorn did his best to calm his beating heart and loaded his arbalest again. During their training, Janus had stressed that, to be a good archer, one must always be calm and collected, no matter the situation, able to complete reloading and aiming without letting the environment affect the smoothness of the actions.Thorn was by no means that good and had to work hard to suppress the slight shake in his hands. Still, due to how far away the corrupted wolves were, he was able to release two more shots, killing two wolves before they closed in on him. The last bolt he left in the ground. Tossing his arbalest behind him, he readied himself to face the last six corrupted wolves.Trying to keep everything Dovon had taught him in mind, Thorn, engaged the group of wolves. Due to the barrier he had made, the corrupted wolves could only approach from the front, causing them to bunch up. This made dealing with them easier, as only two could attack him at a time, which was much more manageable than six.The fight lasted only a few minutes, the corrupted wolves' bloodlust driving them forward with no regard for their wounds or each other. Thorn's armor also worked wonders, staving off three attacks that slipped through his guard. Pleased with his results, Thorn was about to continue his hunt when he heard howls coming from nearby. Grim-faced, he backed up as he saw six more corrupted wolves dashing through the forest toward him.Catching sight of the blood-splattered ground and hearing the increasing number of howls, Thorn realized he was in trouble. Corrupted wolves were, after all, wolves. The noise of his fight with the three groups of wolves, combined with the torrential amounts of blood that had spilled across the ground was attracting more corrupted wolves!For the briefest of moments, Thorn considered running, an instinctive terror taking hold of his heart. But that idea was crushed. The aggressive nature of the wolves was such that they would not let potential prey go. There was little reason for him to believe that he could outrun them, which meant that keeping something at his back to protect himself was the only possible way to survive.As the howls grew in volume, a thrill shot down Thorn's spine. No doubt the coming fight was going to be the most vicious he had yet been in. Yet, somehow, the fear that Thorn expected to feel was not there. Instead, a gleeful energy began to build in his chest, almost making him howl back at the closing wolves.It only took a few moments for the corrupted wolves to come into view, their big, brutish bodies jostling for position even as they closed on him. Thorn wasted no time when they appeared, immediately sending bolts from his arbalest smashing into the wolves as fast as he could. Not even bothering to sight, Thorn aimed and pulled the trigger before drawing back the string and dropping another bolt into the flight groove.Bolt after bolt flew toward the oncoming corrupted wolves, some smashing into them and causing large, bloody rifts in the crowd, others missing and destroying trees or leaving furrows in the ground. Regardless of the result of the shots, each twang of the arbalest string seemed to drive the corrupted wolves into an increasing frenzy!By the time they got too close for Thorn to use his arbalest anymore, he had killed or injured at least fifteen corrupted wolves, but there were at least twice that still coming. Knowing that the arbalest wasn't going to help any longer, Thorn placed it behind his back. Rather than drawing his knife like the last time, Thorn took up a bolt in each hand. While the knife was great for slicing, he was worried that it would get caught on a bone or dull before he was finished with this fight.Plus, as they said in the martial arts world, \"An inch longer, an inch stronger.\" The bolts, while not the length of short spears, were three and a half feet long and made of solid wood with a metal bladed tip. Not only could they be used for stabbing, but they were long enough to help keep the jaws of the corrupted wolves at bay. Preparing himself, Thorn's eyes fixed on the blood red eyes of the corrupted wolf in the front of the rushing crowd. With wild abandon, it threw itself forward, launching itself through the air at Thorn in a desperate bid to be the first to take a bite out of him. With a shift of his body and a slight side step, Thorn put himself out of the line of attack before lifting the bolt in his left hand to chest height and striking out, the bolt driving through the side of the corrupted wolf and pinning it to the tree that stood to his right!Leaving the corrupted wolf hanging on the tree, struggling with its last blood-frothed breath, Thorn lashed out with the bolt in his right hand, drawing a bloody arc across the heads and chests of those corrupted wolves that were close. Stooping, he pulled another bolt from the ground, and, a furious energy erupting from his chest, threw himself forward into the milling group of wolves!The resulting melee was painful and bloody. Wolves ripped at Thorn's armor, most failing to pierce the chain or plate armor on his arms and legs, while Thorn ripped at them. The bolts he wielded at first left long gashes on their flanks and bellies or massive stab wounds on their necks and backs. Somewhere along the line, he lost the bolts in his hands and drew his knife, slashing through legs and spines in a bloody frenzy.The corrupted wolves, driven mad by the smell of blood, backed down not a whit, throwing themselves with ever increasing abandon at Thorn. Not one bit calmer, Thorn paid no attention to the growing wounds on his arms and legs and stabbed, slashed, and crushed any corrupted wolf that was within reach. The excitement that had risen in his chest had begun to burn at an almost feverish pace, making him lose any sense of time as he killed one corrupted wolf after another.Ultimately, the armor that Thorn had purchased showed its worth many times over, protecting his chest and stomach and even preventing any major wounds on his arms and legs. When the blood finally faded from Thorn's vision, he found himself standing in a hellish landscape, blood and body parts scattered wide. Broken bodies of corrupted wolves lay smashed against trees, dismembered limbs strewn across the ground.No stranger to blood, the smell didn't bother Thorn much, but, as he staggered away from the death scene, Thorn couldn't stop himself from shaking. The burning fire in his chest slowly receded, seeming to take his strength with it. His legs trembling, Thorn found a place only a few steps away from the fight where there was no blood and collapsed to the ground with an earth-shaking thump.Resting his back against a tree, Thorn took a deep breath and closed his eyes. What shook him most was not the bloody scene he had created, but the sheer relish he had felt during it. What stood out was not the danger of the snapping jaws but the satisfied feeling he had when smashing them. Thorn had always considered himself a peaceful person, not prone to anger or violence. Why then had he grown so excited about it a moment ago?Gulping in huge breaths as he calmed down, Thorn couldn't help but shake his head. He had tried to use the bolts first and then his knife, but somewhere along the line, he had lost them all, resorting to crushing the corrupted wolves with his bare hands. Rending them limb from limb with sheer strength, his actions had proved Dovon's assumptions. Once he laid a hand on a corrupted wolf, the only possible outcome was its death.After a few moments resting, Thorn stood to his feet. The stench of blood was becoming overwhelming, the metallic tang coating the back of his tongue. After collecting his arbalest and as many of the bolts as he could salvage, Thorn cut the tails off of all the corrupted wolves and left the scene to look for a place to wash.Thorn's first priority was to find somewhere to clean off the sticky, ropey residue of his bloody fight. After clearing the various notifications he had accumulated, Thorn opened up his in-game map. According to his map, Thorn wasn't far from a river. Nova Terra was quite convenient in many ways, and one of those was a lack of sweat and dust when traveling. The game still included sweat when players worked hard and exerted themselves, but traveling down a road did not produce sweat, no matter how hot the sun or how far a player might go.Blood, however, was a different story, and Thorn soon felt disgusting as the blood that covered his armor began to dry. Luckily for him, the river was close, and after only twenty minutes of tromping through the woods, he found it. The river was fast and deep. Thorn was a bit worried that his armor would be swept away. He was still pondering what to do when he heard a low rumble, almost like constant thunder. Curious, he began making his way up the river.Pretty soon the thunderous sound grew in volume, and as he rounded a bend in the river, he began to feel mist in the air. Through the trees, Thorn saw a curtain of water falling from above, cascading down a rocky cliff face to land in a large pool. The pool was the river's source, providing an outlet for the rushing water.Excited, both by the natural beauty of the waterfall and pool and by the prospect of being clean, Thorn waded in, splashing his way underneath the falls. The churning water washed away the dried blood, a thick streak of crimson flowing away from him. Relaxing under the pounding water for a couple minutes, Thorn sighed in satisfaction. The water was chilly but refreshing, and he enjoyed soaking in it for a bit.After his armor was clean, Thorn took it off and put it in his inventory, along with his clothes. Any of his own clothing or armor that entered his inventory would be clean and dried when he pulled it out. This meant that he wouldn't have to leave it out in the sun to dry off. Getting out of the pool, Thorn started a fire and got out some food for a meal. Most of his inventory was full of food, so he would not be going hungry.He had tried to estimate how much food he would need if he was in the wilderness for a week. Based on how hungry he was after that fight, though, Thorn was pretty sure that he would run out much sooner. He was not about to eat corrupted wolves or any of the other small creatures he had come across.", "After he was dry, Thorn got dressed again, putting on his black underclothes and then trying to fit into his somewhat tattered armor. The corrupted wolves, though not strong enough to get through his armor completely, had damaged it, ripping scales off the arms and legs and mangling the bracers and leg guards. With a little bit of pressure, he was able to bend most of the pieces back into shape. It was not pretty by any stretch of the imagination, but at least it was still usable.Sitting on the bank of the river, Thorn thought back over the fight, examining the tactics he had used as well as the moves made by the corrupted wolves. At a certain point, the whole fight became a blur of blood and fur, but, before that, it was pretty apparent that Thorn was tactically inferior to the wolves. While his strategy had been good, it was only his strength and the armor he was wearing that allowed him to carry the day.As he sat and thought about the encounter, he slowly became aware of a strange stillness that had fallen over the whole area. Normally, he would hear the sounds of birds and insects from the forest overlaying the gurgling rush of water as it flowed down the stream. Thorn recognized those sounds almost unconsciously at this point, never paying attention to them.This made their absence all the more startling. Hearing the river running and the leaves rustling in the wind, it took Thorn a moment to realize that all signs of life had vanished. Careful not to react too much to his discovery, Thorn stretched, pushing himself to his feet before looking around.His gaze swung around, seeing nothing on his side of the river. As he looked over the other side of the river, his eyes passed over a particularly deep shadow, before snapping back to stare at it. Something about the shadow seemed unnatural. His instinct was proven right when a man stepped out of the cloaking shadow.Big, at least by normal standards, the stranger had thick, knotted muscle that ran down his bare arms. Large hands hung toward his knees, his fingers twisted into the shape of claws. Deep, green eyes peered eerily from under shaggy brows, and he walked with a strange rocking motion, as if he was going to pounce or break out into a loping run the very next moment. A twisted smile rested on his face, making Thorn glad there was a river between them.That gladness was short lived. The strange man approached the river and, with a sudden leap, flew through the air, landing on the other side. His shoulders hunched and, his long arms touching the ground, he turned his intense green stare on Thorn, who could barely suppress the shiver that ran down his spine.There was something about the stranger, a palpable menace that set Thorn's teeth on edge and made the hair on the back of his neck stand to attention like soldiers on parade day. Only twenty feet separated them, and all Thorn could think about was if he could get his knife or arbalest into play fast enough.His confidence had increased greatly from fighting off all of the corrupted wolves not even an hour earlier, but that confidence seemed to drain right out of him when he looked at the stranger. Afraid even to blink, Thorn couldn't help but give a great start when the stranger opened his mouth to speak.\"What'cha doin' out here?\" he said, his drawn back lips revealing pointy teeth. \"Pretty far from the city, ain't'cha?\"\"Not too far. I'm...\" Thorn paused for a brief moment, deciding not to show the tails he had been about to pull out of his bag. \"I'm just enjoying the scenery.\"\"Uh huh.\" Unconvinced, the man gave Thorn a long, intense look before making his way forward in his strange, rocking gait. Squatting down by the fire, he fixed his green eyes on a bit of the food Thorn had not eaten, licking his lips.\"Would you like some?\" asked Thorn, pushing the meat over.Spearing the meat with a long claw-like nail, the stranger devoured it, juice dripping down into his long beard. Once the meat was gone, he lifted his eyes and resumed gazing at Thorn.\"I'm Thorn.\"\"Hmmm. Gargish. The Blood Hunter,\" said the man, scratching his thigh.\"Nice to meet you, Gargish,\" lied Thorn. \"That is quite the name you have there.\"\"Hmmm.\"Lapsing into silence, Thorn watched Gargish. It was obvious that Gargish had come with some purpose, and his silence made Thorn very uneasy.\"So. Are you from around here?\" asked Thorn.\"Mmhmm,\" affirmed Gargish after a moment, pointing toward his back right. \"Valley of the Fang.\"\"Oh, I haven't been there yet. I hear it has got a lot of corrupted wolves, though. You must be pretty strong to be able to live there.\"\"Mmhmm.\"\"What brings you out this way?\" asked Thorn, as nonchalantly as possible.\"Hunting.\"\"Yeah?\" said Thorn, faking a chipper tone as he dried his sweaty palms on his pants. He had never felt more like a small woodland creature than now. He was one and a half times Gargish's size, but for some reason, he felt like a small, furry rabbit being stared down by a timber wolf. The fire in between them gave him a small degree of comfort, but it was starting to die down.Thorn reached over for another piece of wood and added it, poking the fire in silence until it was blazing again.\"Are you a hunter by trade?\" Thorn asked after the silence became unbearable.\"Heh, yeah.\" Gargish seemed to find the question quite funny and broke into a strange, wheezy laugh.\"Cool. I bet you have seen a lot of places, then. This whole mountain range seems good for hunting, so I imagine you have been to most of it,\" Thorn said, casting around in his mind for topics. \"So far I have only seen some corrupted wolves and some small game, but I can imagine that there are more animals the deeper into the mountains you go.\"Unresponsive to Thorn's leading questions, Gargish stared.\"I mean, I could imagine that there are some bears in the woods. Probably big bears, as well,\" said Thorn, trying to continue the conversation.He lapsed into silence, staring at the other man over the fire. The sun was beginning to sink down toward the horizon, indicating that this day was coming to an end, the golden sunlight sending the shadows of the trees stretching long, like grasping fingers creeping ever closer to Thorn. Seeing the shadows inch toward him as the silence grew, Thorn couldn't help but shiver, reminded of the long, clawed fingers on Gargish's hands. In silence and stillness, they sat there, the only movement that of the flames, leaping between them. The firelight cast Gargish's craggy features into stark relief, causing his bright green eyes to stand out even more.The whole situation began to feel surreal to Thorn. Was he sitting across from a man? Or was it a corrupted wolf? In the growing dusk, Thorn began to have trouble telling what was sitting on the other side of the fire, as the shadows caused Gargish's form to twist and morph, forming something that wasn't wolf, yet wasn't man.Stuck in this strange half-world, somewhere between light and darkness, Thorn jerked as Gargish stood, raising his head to look around. Not sure if the flickering firelight was playing tricks on him, Thorn could swear that Gargish's face had grown a wolfish snout. Flexing his claws, Gargish stared up at the empty night sky. Pointing a clawed finger up at the darkening sky, he smiled his sharp smile.\"The time is coming for the hunt,\" said Gargish, his eyes taking on a fanatical gleam. \"Soon the blood moon will rise, covering the world with its light, and blood shall flow. The new order will be toppled, and the old order will once again step forth into their rightful place. Blood purity will be restored!\"Almost as if to celebrate his statement, a long, eerie howl broke out from the forest to Thorn's right, the trembling sound echoing across the mountains, causing even the sounds of the river to fade away. Deafening silence reigned when the howl finished, but Thorn felt like it was still echoing among the trees.Looking at the still empty sky, Thorn had a sinking sensation that this night was going to be long and hard. Putting his hand behind his back, Thorn found his knife, watching Gargish for any sign of aggression. Gargish, however, seemed to be ignoring him completely, instead gazing with a crazed longing at the darkening sky.\"What is it you are hunting tonight?\" asked Thorn, his back slick with sweat.Gargish's head snapped toward Thorn at the question, his intense green gaze taking on a tinge of the red bloodlust that Thorn had seen in the eyes of the corrupted wolves.\"You.\"\u00a0\"Oh. That's nice,\" said Thorn, a wave of relief washing over him. Somehow having it put into words made it much less scary.\u00a0Down in the corner of his vision, a small symbol had appeared at some point, and Thorn, curious and slightly distracted from the nerve-wracking situation in front of him, focused his attention on it. Nova Terra, like most games, relied on popups to communicate with the player, but, in the interest of immersion, most of the popups were kept as small as possible when outside of towns and cities. Only by focusing on the small symbols that hovered outside of the normal field of view could the popups be brought up for the players to read. Curious about the blinking symbol, Thorn focused part of his attention on to it, causing the popup to expand in front of him into a constantly growing list of messages, one coming right after the other. Watching these two messages chase each other down the page, Thorn breathed another sigh of relief. 'That's right. This is a game,' he thought to himself. He had heard rumors of people who were unable to separate the world of Nova Terra from reality, and he no longer doubted that they existed.\u00a0The combination of the environment, the pressure from Gargish's ability, and Thorn's tired mental state had left Thorn believing that all of this was somehow the only reality, causing him to completely forget that the terrifying being in front of him was a bunch of code. Fortunately, one of his racial abilities was increased resistance to the insidious mental influences that Gargish exuded.Sighing again, Thorn put his hands on his knees and stood up. Gargish, confused as to why the frightening atmosphere he had so carefully crafted had changed, took a step back, as Thorn's figure grew larger and larger. Big himself, Gargish stood at seven feet tall. Yet this human in front of him seemed to keep going up forever. He took another step back.\"Alright, so how are we doing this? Brawl right here? Do I get a head start?\" asked Thorn, picking up the few camp items he had pulled out of his inventory.For a moment, Gargish was at a loss. Wasn't his prey supposed to be terrified? What was with this matter-of-fact tone?\"No plan? Alright, brawl right here it is.\" Thorn pulled out his knife. For all his bravado, Gargish was still giving him a terrifying feeling. Despite his mental resistance being able to overcome Gargish's aura, no one he had met in the game so far gave him such a heavy feeling of menace.\"Wait, wait,\" said Gargish in his raspy voice, waving his clawed hands and grinning menacingly. \"Fighting here is no fun. Hunting is much more fun. Tell you what. I'll give you a thirty-minute head start.\"\"But if you are going to hunt me down, why not have a fight right here?\" asked Thorn, tightening his grip on his knife. Before he had even finished speaking, Gargish's figure blurred, and Thorn felt a sudden pain in his stomach, sending him stumbling backward.\"Heh, that is up to you,\" laughed Gargish as he reappeared where he had been standing across the fire. Scrambling to his feet, Thorn's heart dropped. Gargish was too fast and strong for a direct fight. Calculating in his head, Thorn realized that there was no way he could take him on one-on-one. In fact, if Gargish's fist had been aimed at his throat, Thorn wouldn't even have known how he died.\"Fair enough,\" Thorn said with a cough. \"Thirty minutes, you said?\"Watching Thorn's big form dash off into the woods, Gargish laughed again. No one had ever escaped him, and this abnormally-sized human would not be an exception to that rule.Jogging into the forest, Thorn's mind was working furiously. Since he could not fight Gargish head on, Thorn had to come up with a solution to even the playing field. Gargish was too fast and strong for direct confrontation. Thorn never had any illusion of being able to hide from him either, for a very particular reason. When Gargish hit him in the stomach, Thorn had sensed something being applied to his armor and a quick check had shown that there was a patch of some substance on a couple of the scales.No doubt this was some sort of tracking aid. Thorn had even checked his log-off button, but seeing that it was greyed out, he could only assume that Gargish had a means of keeping him from leaving the game. Despite the growing difficulty of his situation, Thorn once again felt that burning excitement in his chest.He had been discovering more and more that the dangerous, nerve-wracking situations of the game gave him an intense rush of joy and uncontrollable desire to conquer. This situation was no different, and countless possible solutions presented themselves to Thorn as he lengthened his stride through the forest.", "Thorn's size had always been as debilitating as it had been a benefit, but as he ran, he could only marvel at the advantage he had gained in Nova Terra. Unlike the real world, where he couldn't even stand, in game, Thorn's body was perfect. This was nowhere more apparent than while running. Due to the springy forest floor, Thorn's stride was almost four feet long when he walked, almost twice that of an average person.Now that he was running full out, Thorn traveled over nine feet with each step. His long legs seemed to devour the distance, sending him forward at an incredible rate. As he ran, he pondered how he was going to manage the fight against Gargish. Not only was Gargish much faster than he was, but he had natural claws that seemed sharper than those of the corrupted wolves, which meant that close combat was going to be difficult.Gargish was also very strong, as his blow had shown. The punch that had sent Thorn reeling was the first time anything had been able to move his immense weight since he had started Nova Terra. \"Man, I don't know that I can win.\" For the briefest of moments, the thought of how overwhelming Gargish was made Thorn's spirit plummet.'Wait, I can get some help!' Opening his chat feature, Thorn could not help but curse. Like the logout button, the messaging button was greyed out. Not only was he unable to leave the game, but he also could not let anyone know that he was being hunted by a terrifying werewolf.Needing a new plan, Thorn began to analyze his situation, looking for any advantage that he had. After a couple minutes, Thorn had only come up with one: strength. It was not much, but something was better than nothing. A plan began to take form. He would only have one chance, but one chance was better than zero chances. With a deep breath, he opened his map. He had twenty minutes.The first thing he needed was a space that would restrict Gargish's movement. Looking at his map, Thorn considered his options before looking for a cave in one of the nearby mountains. He soon found a cave, almost a mile away, that was inhabited by corrupted wolves. Hoping that it was going to be suitable, Thorn changed direction and continued to run.It took him a bit less than three minutes to get to the cave, covering almost a mile in record time. Shaking his head to himself, Thorn marveled at what he could do when physics no longer applied to his body. The cave was a large hollow in a hill that led deeper into the heart of the mountain. While running he had been able to see on the map that the cave contained a small labyrinth of twisting passages behind the large front chamber, perfect for Thorn's plan.Striding into the front chamber, he soon dispatched the four corrupted wolves that had been resting in the cave. In the back of this front chamber of the cave was a slight crack that he could barely squeeze through to enter the tunnel system. The tunnels themselves were almost eight and a half feet high, meaning that he only had to stoop to make his way through.Finding a nice spot to set up, Thorn checked his clock. Assuming that Gargish had actually adhered to the rules of the game, Thorn still had four minutes before Gargish would even start. However, Thorn had a suspicion that Gargish did not care about following the rules and was on his way already, which meant that he didn't have much time to prepare.Thorn flexed his hands and then began to dig into the walls of the tunnel, pulling stone and dirt down into the cave to widen it on one side. Since the tunnel was uniform, Thorn blocked the whole passage as he stood in it. By digging out the wall on his right, Thorn created a little pocket where he could swing his knife, just deep enough that his knife would not touch the wall. Thorn nodded to himself and continued his work.Gargish, who had already arrived outside the cave entrance, as Thorn had guessed, was experiencing a strange sensation - shock. He had started as soon as Thorn was out of sight, his sensitive nose following the special scent of the paste he had applied to Thorn's armor. Sneering to himself, he could imagine the hopelessness on his prey's face when he realized that, no matter how far he ran, Gargish was right there. Nothing gave him more pleasure than appearing next to his prey as soon as the half hour head start was up.At least, that was the plan. But Thorn traveled too fast. Way too fast. Looking at the massive footprints in the forest floor, Gargish couldn't help but be somewhat unsettled. Never before had he tracked such prey. Thorn covered distance at an astronomical rate, almost faster than Gargish could. The other strange thing was his direction. Every other human Gargish had hunted instinctively headed for a city.Yet this fellow went in a different direction, angling away from the city and heading, instead, toward the corrupted wolf-infested mountains. Wasn't he afraid of being surrounded? Sniffing at the entrance to the cave, Gargish hesitated for a moment. Something about the dark cave mouth made him feel uneasy. Shaking his head in annoyance, Gargish growled to himself. When had he ever been afraid of his prey?With a last glance around, Gargish bounded into the cave only to come up short. Four bisected corrupted wolf corpses lay on the ground. Eyes narrowed, Gargish knelt down and examined the bodies. Given the smoothness of the cut, he could imagine the speed at which the blade had been traveling, but the angle was a bit strange. As he continued to look, a mental image of Thorn slashing out with his large knife appeared in his mind. Once again, a sliver of warning tried its best to worm its way into Gargish's heart. This massive human was different. The feeling was not anything concrete, but the combination of many small things that Gargish had seen was starting to add up. As he had made his way to the cave, he saw none of the signs that terrified prey would give off. There were no broken branches, crushed undergrowth, or anything to indicate that his prey was running scared. His big prey had run, yes, but not in fear. Based on how fast he had moved, it was reasonable for Thorn to believe he could actually escape, yet he had come to this out-of-the-way place and trapped himself in a cave, where his size would restrict his movement. The man's entering the cave had been deliberate and forthright, despite knowing that there were corrupted wolves inside.This was not the mark of someone who was afraid.And, judging from the corpses of the corrupted wolves, Thorn had dealt with them without breaking a sweat. The cuts were too smooth and precise to be the work of someone shaking with fear. This left only one reasonable possibility, and that possibility left Gargish shaken. Was Thorn not afraid?Gargish could not be entirely blamed for the worry that had begun to form in his heart. His natural ability to terrify had never failed before, so Thorn presented a new, strange situation that he had never come across. Thorn had seemed to be scared when they first met, but none of his actions since then had even smelled of the terror that he should have been feeling.Shaking himself, Gargish crushed the small thread of worry in his chest. So what if his prey was not terrified right now? Wasn't terrifying his prey Gargish's greatest skill? If that stupid human was not afraid, then Gargish would teach him the meaning of fear! With a rumbling growl, Gargish launched forward into the depths of the cave. Thorn was standing in the tunnel he had modified, giving one last look around him at his handiwork. The more he thought about what he was doing, the more foolish he felt. Gargish had proven himself to be much faster than Thorn back at the river, so Thorn had no idea if this was going to work. It would come down to how Gargish attempted to kill him.Opening up his inventory, Thorn took out some food and planted himself in the middle of the tunnel, facing the way he had come. To his left, there was almost no room between his shoulder and the wall while, to his right, he had cleared enough space to allow him to swing his blade. Also, tired of crouching, Thorn had dug out a bit of space for his head to fit when he stood up.Munching on the sandwich he had gotten out, Thorn waited patiently for Gargish to arrive. Surprised by how calm he was as he faced his first death in Nova Terra, Thorn could only guess that it was his Titan's Strength ability kicking in. After a couple of minutes passed, he finished his fourth sandwich, so he pulled up a browser and began to look up information on dying in Nova Terra. Information was sparse, but after reading through a few threads, Thorn managed to piece some details together.Unlike the real world, death in Nova Terra was not permanent. It was, after all, a game. However, the penalties were not light, either. When a player was killed in Nova Terra, a couple things would happen. First, their equipment and a bag containing a random selection from their inventory would drop. Each item in their inventory had a variable chance to drop, which meant that players could lose a lot of items, or very few, based on how lucky they were.Second, the killed player would experience a drop in the mastery of their class. While it was not as bad as being reset, it was a definite setback. After all, it took a long time to train up mastery in a class, and every single death would wipe away countless hours of hard work. Skill proficiency was left untouched, but having to retrain a class over and over was painful.Many players had complained bitterly about this mechanic, which led Horizon to introduce a patch that allowed players who died to regain their mastery faster than they had before they died. The tradeoff was that, if they died again before their mastery was regained, it would be gone.These two penalties had created a timid player force, which had driven the creator of Nova Terra crazy but had paved the way for a solid, systematic settling of the world of Nova Terra, much the same way the far reaches of the earth had been settled. Over time, however, players had come to realize that death was not something to fear, and the current sentiments toward dying in Nova Terra were very casual.Thorn was finishing his seventh sandwich when a flicker in a shadow at the other end of the tunnel alerted him that he was no longer alone. Dusting off his hands, Thorn firmly gripped his knife, drawing it out and holding it diagonally in front of him. Crouching a bit, his left hand raised up with his palm out, Thorn watched Gargish slink out of the shadows.Gargish was at home among the flickering torchlight and deep pools of shadow. He seemed to become part of the shadow as he passed through it, moving fluidly toward Thorn in an unhurried manner, his silent steps making no sound even when he passed over the gravel that Thorn had scattered.\"You found me,\" said Thorn when Gargish drew close. Thorn's eyes stayed glued to Gargish, taking in every tiny move the werewolf made.\"Was that ever in question?\" asked Gargish, curious as to how the mind of this giant human was working.\"No, of course not. It was a matter of when.\"\"Haha, it's good that you recognized that. Saves both of us much trouble,\" snickered Gargish. \"Tell me, though. Why didn't you keep running?\"\"Running? I was never running,\" said Thorn with a small smile, a bead of sweat trickling down his face. \"Haha, you sure looked like you were running to me!\" laughed Gargish.\"Nah, I was not running. It was a tactical retreat,\" said Thorn.\"What? Tactical retreat?\" Gargish narrowed his evil eyes. \"Do you think you have a chance to live?\"Still watching the werewolf, Thorn could feel the danger radiating off of him in palpable waves. He knew, without question, that this one enemy was more dangerous than anything he had faced up until this point. Once again, a dreadful excitement began to build in the base of Thorn's chest.\"Isn't there always a chance?\" asked Thorn, struggling to keep his voice from shaking.\"Ha!\" Gargish snarled, his eyes starting to become bloodshot. \"There is never a chance when I am the one hunting.\"\"Wait, wait. Hold on.\" Thorn stood up from his crouch and took a hurried step backward, almost hitting his head on the roof of the tunnel. \"Can't we talk about this?\"\"A bit late for that.\" Almost instinctively, Gargish took a step forward, mirroring Thorn's action. \"Once you become my prey, there is only one possible outcome. Your agonizing, slow death!\"\"Come on, I know we can come to some sort of solution here.\" At this point, Thorn was babbling as Gargish stalked toward him, ignoring what Thorn was saying. Trembling, Thorn put his knife between them as he continued to move backward.Gargish, seeing Thorn continue to retreat, flashed forward, his wicked claws stabbing toward Thorn's chest! Almost too fast for Thorn's eye to follow, he covered the few feet between them in an instant! Acting on pure instinct, Thorn stabbed forward with his knife, while bringing his left arm across his chest to block.Twisting his body to avoid the knife, Gargish's claws clashed with Thorn's bracer with a loud clang, sending sparks flying. Before Thorn could strike again, Gargish danced back out of range, his padded feet making no sound as he stalked back and forth. Snarling at Thorn as his bloodlust began to grow, Gargish's fury deepened. When had he ever had this much trouble with his prey?At this point, Thorn should be a quivering mess on the floor! Instead, he was a literal wall of flesh, taking up almost the whole passage. As Gargish watched in fury, getting ready for his next attack, Thorn had backed farther into the passage, where he had to crouch to walk, causing Gargish's eyes to light up for a moment.Where Thorn had been standing, the roof was high enough that it did not impede Thorn's movements. However, now that he had left that space, his large size would be a hindrance. Not only was his forward posture bad for his defensive form, but if Gargish could get around behind him, Thorn would have trouble turning around.As it was, stepping out of the taller part of the passage was a rookie mistake, especially given Gargish's blinding speed. Sneering at Thorn's inexperience, the werewolf stalked closer, his fierce eyes boring into Thorn's armored form. The pressure of the aura rolling off of him seemed to solidify for a moment, causing Thorn to flinch backward as if he were stung!", "Taking his opening, Gargish flashed to the left, squeezing past Thorn while landing a punch on his ribs. Throwing all his formidable power into the strike, Gargish was stunned when he failed to move Thorn in the least! Failing to get the result he wanted, the werewolf did not let it shake him and recovered, landing behind Thorn and sending out a flurry of blows!As soon as Gargish moved left, Thorn reacted as though shocked, his body falling forward to rest on his left leg as his right leg slid behind him. From this lunging position, Thorn twisted his body to his right, turning around. The move was so smooth and natural, it caught the frenzied werewolf off guard as his claws raked the air where Thorn's back had been a moment before.Launching himself off his back leg, Thorn pushed forward, stabbing out with his knife again. Gargish was too fast and danced backward, keeping out of the knife's range. However, as he backed up, his instincts kicked in, and he threw a glance backward, only to be met with the unbelievable sight of a solid pile of dirt and rock!A slight curve in the tunnel had previously hidden it from his view, but the entire tunnel was filled with dirt and rocks, trapping him! Unbelieving, he stared at it, his instincts screaming at him that he was in a whole world of trouble! And his instincts were right. Now facing the panicked werewolf, Thorn pushed forward, his bulky body taking up the whole tunnel!Smashing forward toward Gargish, Thorn left no room for the werewolf to dodge. A desperate attempt to squeeze by on the left was met with a powerful palm strike that sent Gargish reeling, his arms feeling like they had been hit with a sledgehammer! Desperate, Gargish erupted in fury, his claws striking out in blow after blow, causing blood to splash as his wickedly sharp claws broke through Thorn's scalemail!Thorn seemed impervious to the pain, ignoring the blood flowing from his arms as he pushed forward again, forcing Gargish to step back. Gathering his strength, Thorn burst forth, slamming into Gargish with his body, his two fists landing on the werewolf's muscular chest.Gargish felt like he had been run over by a train. Well, not a train precisely, since he had no concept of what a train was. Gargish felt like he had been run over by a dragon. At least, he assumed that this is what it would feel like. As Thorn's two fists came forward, Gargish's bloodfury was pierced by the sudden and clear realization that he was about to die.It was a strange sort of feeling, an inevitable certainty that cut through all the chaos in his mind. His thirst for blood, his hunger for the terror and suffering of his prey, his anger, and fear of being cornered, his wolfish instincts to fight for his life. All of that ceased for the briefest of moments, as this fact marched across his very being.The two fists grew larger, coming forward in slow motion to slam into his chest with unstoppable force. When they were still inches away, Gargish could feel his chest starting to compress from the force of the air alone! When they made contact, Gargish wondered if this was the feeling of being kicked in the chest by a hundred horses at the same time.Thorn's mind was operating with startling clarity. The excitement that seemed to rise in his chest with every fight brought with it the uncontrollable urge to smash and destroy, but it did not cloud his thinking in the slightest. Rather, it seemed to lend a sharpness to his thoughts that hadn't been there before. Every twitch of muscle, every grimace of his enemy's lips, was taken in, processed and used to adjust his blows.Smashing into Gargish's chest, Thorn sent the werewolf flying back, almost imprinting him into the wall of debris that Thorn had piled up, his chest crushed and bleeding. Yet even then, Thorn's hyper-focused mind sent him forward. Stepping closer, the only thing in Thorn's brain was indexing. Get in range, get in contact. The lesson Dovon had pounded into his head surfaced, and Thorn reached out a massive hand, clamping down on the shaken werewolf's shoulder!Gargish was still recovering from the unbelievable force that had sent him back when a vice grip landed on his shoulder. Struggling with all his might, Gargish tried to shake off the hand, but to no avail. \"How is he this strong!\" the werewolf screamed in his mind.Thorn wasted no time, and as soon as his hand made contact, he started to throw out blow after blow at Gargish' head, smashing him into oblivion! Punch after punch rained down on Gargish's skull, an ominous cracking sound giving testament to how hard Thorn was striking. Each punch heavier than the last, it wasn't long before Thorn's bloody fist smashed straight through to the ground below, blood and brain matter splashing over the ground.Still keyed up, Thorn dropped the corpse of the werewolf to the ground, his shoulders heaving as he gulped in big breaths of air. Bloodshot eyes looked around for more enemies, and finding none, he slumped to the ground, the energy draining out of him. It took Thorn almost ten minutes to recover. Only a few brief moments had passed since Gargish had come down into the tunnels after him, but it had felt like hours. *Ding*   Thorn waved the myriad of windows away, unsure about what had happened. After Gargish died, a massive surge of energy seemed to diffuse into the surroundings, and numerous windows popped up in his vision. With the game logs, he could always go back to check the details later. Right now he was more concerned with the loot.Looking at the headless corpse, Thorn frowned. How was he supposed to find the ring in this bloody mess? For a moment, he squatted there, poking what was left of the werewolf's body with his knife. After a couple of seconds, the body dissolved into light particles, and a few items were revealed on the ground. Apart from the ring that he had been expecting, there was a sack of 10 gold and a small silver token with a crack running down the middle.The loot was picked up and put away in his inventory, and Thorn examined the ring. Slipping the ring onto his finger, Thorn called up his status. He had gained some bonuses from slaying Gargish and completing the Blood Moon event and wanted to check his new titles out. Scratching his head, Thorn pondered his status. Not a whole lot had visibly changed from before since most of his stats were hidden. A field had been added for his new ability, however, it was as minimalist as the rest of the fields. In fact, the only ability he had listed was still locked away, because the [Lord Greymane] title was locked, as well. Deciding not to worry about it for the time being, Thorn cleared the passage of all the dirt and stone he had piled up to trap Gargish.The whole plan had been quite tenuous, but Gargish had reacted the way Thorn had assumed he would. Based on the hit-and-run fighting style that wolves preferred, Thorn had been confident that Gargish's combat style was going to be hard to pin down. With the Blood Hunter's speed, there was no way that Thorn would have been able to win a fight in an open area, as the werewolf could have dodged backward. This was the same reason that Thorn did not bother to try and shoot him with his arbalest. Even putting aside the fact that Thorn was not confident that the bolt could have harmed Gargish, it was even less likely that he could have hit him with it. Gargish was too fast, but fortunately, he was also arrogant, not considering Thorn a foe to be respected.Thorn had been hoping that the close quarters and single direction of approach afforded by the tunnels would give him a chance to trade blows with the werewolf, never suspecting that Gargish would throw himself into a corner. As soon as he had landed a solid blow, the fight had been over. As he spread the rocks and dirt along the floor of the tunnel to keep it clear, Thorn could not help but marvel at his own strength.Because of the test he had done upon entering Nova Terra, he had at least a conceptual understanding of how strong he was, but it was very hard to translate that into a practical understanding of what that meant. Plus, he kept having this nagging feeling that the strength he felt wasn't actually the limit.Take, for example, his strike against Gargish. As soon as he had released the blow, Thorn had felt that it was different. Not a punch, but something more. Almost an expression of will, gathering strength not only from his tendons and muscles but pulling power from the bones of the earth around them to crush everything before it.That feeling, clear one moment, but slipping away the very next, had left him with an emptiness, as if a crucial, life-bringing vein had run dry. Shaking his head, Thorn finished cleaning up and crawled out of the tunnel. When he got out, he stretched and twisted his body, glad to be back under the sky. While he wasn't claustrophobic, having to bend over was annoying.As soon as he got the notification that Gargish had died, his messages and logout button were reactivated, and he saw that he had a blinking message from Hamm, the weapons trainer from the Berum Training Hall. Opening it up, he saw Hamm's stubble-covered face. [Hey Thorn, thought I'd send you a message. I know you are out hunting corrupted wolves, but Master Sun came back, so you can probably go find him if you want. I think he'd fit your combat style pretty well if you can get him to teach you anything. He can get weird about that sometimes. Always prattling on about how his weapon is the only 'true' weapon and all that nonsense. Hah. Give me a chopping blade any day. Anyway, be careful out there and come back and visit soon.]It took Thorn a moment to remember that Hamm had given him a quest to find Master Sun. Pulling up the quest, he looked at the area marked on his map. Last time he had set out to find Master Sun, he had not made it far at all. It had worked out though, as that is where he had met Ouroborus, Velin, Mina, and Jorge.The area marked on his map was not too far away, so Thorn decided to stop there on his way back to town. There were still a few days before he needed to meet up with Ouroboros and the rest of the team, so he did not have anything better to do anyway. Setting off, Thorn moved toward the mountains to the north of Berum, where Master Sun was located. Unlike the old-growth forest where he had been fighting the corrupted wolves, the rolling hills to the north of the city were covered in scrub brush and small stands of new growth forest. It was among these younger trees that Thorn came upon a run-down hut with a smoking fire pit out front. Sitting at the fire was a middle-aged, Asian-looking man with a balding head and two of the largest arms Thorn had ever seen on a human. Dirty red armor with broken stitching and karuta made Thorn think of an out of work samurai. What did they call them? Ronin, that's right.Guzzling something out of a bottle, the middle-aged man belched before stuffing more meat into his mouth. Seeing that he was being ignored, Thorn crouched down by the fire and pulled out his own food. After he took out the first dish, there was no reaction, but by the time he had taken out the fifth, Thorn could feel a burning gaze resting on him. Looking over, he saw the middle-aged man staring at the food in his hands. \"Would you like some?\" Thorn offered. Seeing the man's eyes light up, Thorn passed a few of the dishes over, letting the bedraggled man help himself. Between the two of them, they had soon finished off eleven portions and four bottles of ale that Thorn pulled out of his inventory. After they were done, the man belched again, the stale smell of alcohol wafting off of him.Scratching his back, he stood and ambled into the flimsy shed, kicking the door shut as he fell onto a dirty mat. Thorn stared in bemusement at the small shack that looked like it would fall over in stiff breeze and sighed. He was about to leave to continue looking for Master Sun when he noticed that his quest had updated.", " Reading the quest summary almost caused Thorn to spit out the mouthful of ale he had swigged. \"He's Master Sun?\" thought Thorn, shaking his head, \"Wow. Just goes to show that you never can tell.\"The dirty, middle-aged drunk who had gorged himself on food, and then fallen into a dead sleep in the hut, certainly did not fit Thorn's mental picture of a martial arts master. Ms. Chen, his Taijiquan master, was what came to mind when he thought of a master. Still, if Hamm said that this Master Sun was able to help him, Thorn did not have any reason to assume otherwise. Either way, he would not know until Master Sun woke up.The night passed, but when the morning came, the sun struggled to emerge from behind the heavy, dark clouds. Yawning and stretching, Thorn began his morning exercises. After running through his Taijiquan forms, he shadowboxed for a few minutes and then spent a bit practicing shooting his arbalest.After he was finished, he looked around for something to do while he waited for Master Sun to get up. Almost two hours later, the middle-aged man wandered sleepily out of his shack and looked at Thorn, who was trying to do handstands in the yard. Seeing that Master Sun had come out, Thorn got to his feet, dusting himself off. \"Hello, Master Sun. My name is Thorn.\" Introducing himself, Thorn bowed slightly. \"Hamm sent me to see you to further my training.\"\"Further training?\" Master Sun scratched the back of his balding head. \"What makes you think I can teach you anything?\"\"Truthfully? I'm not sure,\" admitted Thorn. \"But I trust that Hamm would not lead me astray. He told me to come to find you after declaring that I was not suitable to wield a sword.\"\"Wait, Hamm said that?\" Master Sun walked a loop around Thorn, staring at him. \"That guy is obsessed with swords. He has never once hesitated to force his junky beliefs on another person. And he told you that you are not suitable for using a sword?\"\"Yes, master. Hamm said that my size was too limiting for swordplay and that I would not be able to cut properly because I have trouble using finesse when striking.\"Seeing Master Sun's confused look, Thorn stepped over to a small tree that was growing out of the hillside. Pulling out his knife, he gave a casual swing, lopping the eight-inch tree right off its trunk. Grabbing the tree that started to fall toward the shed Master Sun had slept in, Thorn breathed a sigh of relief.Master Sun stared at Thorn, with stars in his eyes. Running over to the newly shorn tree stump, he ran his fingers over the rough edge where the knife had impacted the wood. Once the knife had entered the tree, the break was clean, but right where Thorn had started the cut, the wood was smashed and splintered from the force of the blow.\"Haha, he wasn't joking, was he? Kid, it's your lucky day! Wait here,\" Master Sun said over his shoulder, laughing in excitement as he ran into his shed. In a moment, he returned, carrying a massive metal club that came up to his chest.A brutish, fearsome looking weapon, the small end of the club was as thick as his wrist, wrapped in leather and topped with a metal ring. The club's head was three times the size of the grip and covered in large metal studs. The whole weapon glistened, its oiled metal sheen showing how well Master Sun cared for it. Carrying it over his shoulder, Master Sun did not even blink when, in his rush to get out of the shack, the club clipped the side of the doorframe, sending splinters flying. A shiver ran through the shack, and Thorn watched in fascinated horror as the entire structure collapsed, one shaky wall at a time. Master Sun, on the other hand, did not seem to care at all. Instead, cradling his weapon gently, he presented it for Thorn to see.\"This, this is a weapon, kid. A weapon for strong men! None of that sissy cutting or slashing, good old-fashioned force. The enemy has a blade? Great. Crush them. The enemy has a shield? Even better. Crush them. Is the enemy playing with arrows? Awesome, knock them out of the air and then crush them. Need to move an object or negotiate a tense situation?\"\"Crush it?\" Thorn guessed, as Master Sun took a deep breath.\"Exactly! Crush it.\" Master Sun beamed. \"No matter the problem, brute force is the solution.\" Stepping back, Master Sun flipped the club up, and, with a twist of his wrist, he sent it humming through the air. Faster and faster he swung it around him, the weight of the club increasing its speed with every rotation. Within a minute, the club was moving so fast that Thorn could not even see it.He could, however, hear it. The swinging club let out a thunderous drone as it smashed its way through the air. As the drone seemed to reach a crescendo, Master Sun stepped forward and flicked his arm toward a tree, which exploded in a shower of splinters. The club had swung over in a dark blur, too fast for Thorn to catch, obliterating the trunk. Grinning, Master Sun lifted his club up and brushed off a few splinters still sticking to it.\"This, young man, is a tetsubo! A real man's weapon!\"Impressed, Thorn examined the tetsubo. He could see how it would be an effective weapon. Constructed of metal, swinging it would generate a tremendous force without the danger of breaking that a sword would face. The metal studs took the damage one step further, adding a ripping effect to the blow. Seeing how interested Thorn was, Master Sun's grin grew bigger. \"How about it? Fancy learning how to use a real weapon?\"\"I'd love to!\" responded Thorn. He had used staves before, but this was a whole different sort of thing. A staff, in order to be the proper size, had to be massive, which made it prohibitive to use in most spaces. The tetsubo, on the other hand, was the same size as a large sword but wielded much like a staff.\"In that case, let's begin. Have you ever done any martial arts training?\" Seeing Thorn's nod, Master Sun continued. \"Excellent, then you should know what a horse stance looks like. Let's start there.\"Much like Thorn's Taijiquan instructor, Master Sun first had Thorn drop into and hold a horse stance. Once Thorn was in the proper position, he rested his tetsubo across Thorn's knees, telling him that if it fell off, the amount of time he had to stay in the horse stance would increase. Thorn, unable to feel the weight of the heavy weapon because of the mechanics of Nova Terra, stayed in his seated position.Master Sun walked to the side and waited for Thorn to show the slightest sign that he was tired. And waited. And waited. After close to forty minutes, Master Sun finally got fed up with waiting and grabbed his tetsubo off of Thorn's legs.\"Alright, stand up.\" Staring at Thorn, who was not fatigued in the slightest, Master Sun narrowed his eyes. \"I'm guessing it would do neither of us any good if I were to make you run for a while. Anyway, the long and short of it is that the key to using a tetsubo is your lower body. Much like a staff, the tetsubo requires a strong base from which to control the force of the weapon.\"Unlike bladed weapons, the tetsubo only has a single attacking function. Crushing. It can be used to block, as well, but at the end of the day, that is much less efficient than smashing someone. The key, of course, is being able to hit them. We achieve that through making use of the constant motion of the weapon to turn offense into defense.\"In short, if there is no time for your opponent to attack, there is no need for defense. And if you do need it, you should be able to divert the attack through a direct strike. You need to remember one thing. Push forward. Always push forward. The power of the tetsubo is in its constant, aggressive, dominating nature. No matter the obstacle, the tetsubo's solution is to crush it under overwhelming force. Now, let me show you the basic moves that you will practice.\"Lending Thorn a tetsubo that he pulled out of his inventory, Master Sun began to show him how to spin the weapon using a combination of specialized grips and the ring on the back end of the handle. Each hand position maximized the weapon's ability to rotate while gaining momentum. Due to his previous practice with a staff, Thorn picked it up rather quickly and, within a day, was able to keep the weapon moving well.After a day of practice, Master Sun nodded in appreciation and took Thorn with him to get some practical experience. After walking for about two hours, they arrived at a rocky gorge in the mountains, near the kobold valley. Master Sun stopped at the edge of the gorge and pointed at the other end.\"Alright, kid, your task is pretty simple. Get to the other end of the gorge.\"\"You mean all I have to do is walk through it?\"\"Haha, yeah. All you have to do is walk through it.\" Nodding, Master Sun chuckled to himself as he started to walk off. \"I'll wait for you at the other side.\"\"O...okay.\" Unsure about what was so difficult about walking through an empty gorge, Thorn scratched his head. Even after spending ten minutes staring at the large rocks in the gorge, Thorn could not see anything out of the ordinary, so, with a shrug, he started forward.[crunch]After getting almost one hundred feet into the gorge, Thorn paused. The sound had been slight, but Thorn had heard gravel crunching. Paused mid-stride, Thorn listened. After a few moments of complete silence, he could only shrug and continue on.[Crunch]There it was again. It was like the sound of two pieces of stone grinding against each other. Still unable to spot where the sound was coming from, Thorn tightened his grip on his weapon and began to move forward. He had not taken more than three steps when the sound returned with a vengeance.[CRUNCH][CRUNCH][CRUNCH]Rising up from all around him, Thorn saw large stone monsters pushing themselves to their feet. Immense boulders that had previously stood inert began to stretch and unfold as they became stone giants. Around seven feet tall at the shortest, these large stone humanoids were huge amalgamations of stone held together with eldritch force. As the first elemental finished forming, it turned its burning eyes on Thorn.'Earth elementals!' thought Thorn in shock. Elementals were a rare race in Nova Terra, in part because of how strong they were. A single elemental was often more than the match of a normal party, due to their overwhelming strength and natural immunities. It would be rare to even find a single elemental, so seeing dozens beginning to stand up left Thorn flabbergasted. 'How on earth does Master Sun expect me to cross a gorge like this!?' Thorn shouted in his mind. Earth elementals were ranked as some of the most dangerous enemies to face, boasting a combination of complete immunity to bladed weapons and most magic, as well as uncanny strength.The first elemental, fully formed now, stepped forward and threw a ponderous fist at Thorn, smashing him back! Thorn, stunned at the strength that the elemental displayed, was shaken. For the second time since he had begun to play Nova Terra, he was forced back!Shaken by the blow that had sent him stumbling back, Thorn completely forgot to block the next strike, which caught him in the chest! Staggering backward, Thorn almost fell over. Putting down a hand to stabilize himself, he looked at the stone elemental that had punched him in amazement. Pleased by its success, the elemental was roaring in satisfaction, secure in its instinctive knowledge that it had crushed the puny invader.After it finished announcing its victory to the sky, the elemental looked around, only to freeze. That large creature was still there? The elemental peered closer. Sure enough, Thorn was still standing there, rubbing his chest where the elemental's massive fist had smashed into him.'That is going to bruise for sure,' thought Thorn. \"Alright, big guy, let's try this again,\" Thorn spat at the elemental, his eyes narrowing. Fixing his grip on the borrowed tetsubo, Thorn dashed forward, smashing toward the confused elemental with an overhead blow. The elemental, unable to process how the creature had lived through its punch, saw Thorn rushing forward and roared in fury. Drawing back its ponderous fists, it struck out with full force, intent on fixing whatever mistake it had made previously. With a furious clash, the tetsubo fell onto the elemental's shoulder before the elemental's fists reached Thorn's body.Feeling the rebounding shock flowing through the tetsubo's handle, Thorn nearly lost his grip on it. The force of the blow sent the elemental tumbling to the ground. However, Thorn had yet to recover from the counter-force of the attack when the elemental started to get back to its feet!'This isn't good.' Thorn paled, feeling as much shock as the elemental had. This was the first time that a full force blow had failed him since he started Nova Terra! Despite being knocked off of its feet, the elemental was not showing any sort of damage. And to top it off, the second and third elemental were already stomping their way over, more rising up behind them.\"How am I supposed to get through this gorge?\" Thorn complained in his heart. Countless calculations and ideas flashed before him. Could he dodge his way through? Unlikely, since the elementals were strong enough to knock him back. What if he blocked as many of the blows as possible and pushed past the elementals? That would not work, either. There were too many of them. Was this an impossible task, then?\u00a0", "\"No, there has to be a way to do this,\" thought Thorn. Master Sun would not have assigned it if there was no way to complete it. Running through all of the instruction that Master Sun had given him as he backed up, Thorn's eyes brightened. \"That's it!\"What was a tetsubo for? Attacking! Offense as defense! After all, in his exchange now, he had been able to prevent the elemental from hitting him by striking first! He needed to use speed and force to create a perfect defense by crushing any attack before it arrived! Emboldened, Thorn looked at the two charging elementals. Trying to remember the way Master Sun had begun his spinning pattern, Thorn did not wait for the elementals to attack, but swung out at the larger of the two with a full force sweep, like he was trying for a home run.The tetsubo impacted the larger elemental's side, causing it to stagger sideways, into the smaller elemental, with a loud crunch. Despite buying himself a couple seconds, Thorn frowned. Neither of his strikes had been enough to hurt the elementals, which highlighted a major problem. Every second he spent here, more and more earth elementals were waking up and rushing toward him. Soon they would overwhelm him with sheer numbers.The world slowed to a crawl, as his brain began to work furiously. His goal was to cross the gorge without dying. But his normal approach had no way of working because his strikes were not powerful enough to kill the creatures attacking him. If he couldn't remove the elementals from the equation, their attacks would compound until he could not block them.\"Wait. Why am I trying to block them? What was it that Master Sun said? Attacking is a more effective block.\" Awareness dawning, Thorn finally understood why Master Sun would have thrown him into this hopeless situation. If his goal was only to cross the gorge, there was no reason that he had to kill the elementals. The forms that Master Sun had demonstrated immediately sprang to mind, and his hands began to turn, the tetsubo gaining momentum as it spun around him. Driving forward again, Thorn intercepted the first elemental with a slashing strike, causing it to stumble. Stepping past, Thorn used the counter-force to send a whirling strike at the legs of another earth elemental stepping forward, sweeping it off its feet.Step by step, blow by twirling blow, Thorn carved his way forward. However, he was able to achieve only a few steps at a time before a furious blow sent him reeling back. Scrambling to regain his balance, he pushed forward with a wild strike, trying to gain some space. Warding off another punch with a deflection, he started his tetsubo spinning again, using it to throw the incoming attacks to the side.This time, he managed four steps before being beaten back. Again, he struggled to regain his stance, pushing forward with all the force he could muster. Time after time, he smashed his way through the roaring elementals, only to be pushed back every few steps. Yet, each time he was forced back, he forged ahead again, his weapon flashing, beating back the surging elementals.As the seconds ticked by, Thorn found himself falling into a strange sort of frenetic rhythm, each of his attacks with his tetsubo becoming smoother and faster. A whirling strike to one side began to flow into a whirling strike to the other side. Blocks began to flow into attacks and attacks into warding strikes. Where he was getting pushed back before, Thorn was soon able to hold his ground.This increased mastery came at a cost, as blow after a massive blow slammed into his body. Groaning in pain after each strike, Thorn felt his bruised body shaking with the strain of pushing through the flurry of stone fists flying at him. Little by little, bit by bit, his arms began to lose strength, as bruises piled up on his shoulders and chest. Gritting his teeth, Thorn knew that he was not going to make it through at this rate. With a roar of unwillingness, he turned and ran, outpacing the ponderous earth elementals. Simple creatures, the earth elementals lost interest in Thorn as soon as he escaped, out of sight. After wandering around in the gorge for a few moments, the earth elementals began to revert to their stone forms, and soon the gorge was silent again.Panting, Thorn could only throw himself down on the ground, groaning in pain. His arms and chest were bruised, and even his head was starting to swell from where a flying fist had clipped him. Yet, even as he lay there beaten, his spirit started to grow. He had learned some very difficult lessons in his first encounter with the earth elementals, and he was confident that his next encounter would be different.\"Well, that was pathetic,\" a voice said. Thorn didn't even need to open his eyes to know that Master Sun was standing over him.\"Seriously, what were you doing flailing about like that? Didn't I teach you the forms? How come I didn't see any of them while you were fighting there?\"\"Sorry, Master Sun.\" Not bothering to argue, Thorn instinctively replied as he would have to his own sifu, Ms. Chen. He had learned long ago that the sharp criticism was part of what came with having a martial arts teacher.\"You shouldn't be apologizing to me. You should be apologizing to those poor earth elementals, whose time you wasted.\" Master Sun worked hard to keep the shock out of his voice, covering up his lack of confidence with scathing words. Thorn was not the first person he had sent into the elemental-filled gorge, but none of the others had made it past the initial elemental the first time they went in. In fact, most had been sent right out of the gorge with that earth elemental's first strike. Master Sun had been dumbfounded when, after taking the strike, Thorn had continued on like nothing happened and pushed almost into the center of the gorge!Master Sun scratched his balding head in puzzlement. He had matched blows with the elementals countless times before, but this was the first time he had ever encountered someone who could shrug off their blows like they were nothing. Shaking his head, he thought to himself, 'What a freak.'\"Alright, kid, there will be other chances to try again. Let's go back and eat. I'm hungry.\"Dragging his protesting body up, Thorn followed after Master Sun, limping back to the camp. Bruises had begun to appear on his hips and sides, making walking difficult. Master Sun didn't move too fast, and Thorn was able to follow him back to the camp. The shack seemed to have restored itself, at some point, and was standing, as tenuous as ever.After resting for a night, Nova Terra's mechanics kicked in, and Thorn woke up feeling much better. Getting up, he ran through his morning exercise again before he began to practice the hand positions that Master Sun had taught him the day before. He thought over his experience fighting against the mass of earth elementals. Breaking down each of the moments that he remembered, he tried to determine what the best strike would have been in that situation.As he became more and more familiar with the different hand positions, the general flow of his tetsubo's swings got smoother and smoother. But there was a real problem that Thorn had no way of solving, so he waited for Master Sun to get up, continuing to practice. After a couple more hours, Master Sun walked out of his shed, bleary-eyed.\"Good morning, Master Sun,\" Thorn greeted, ever polite.\"Hm,\" grunted Master Sun with a yawn.Waiting until Master Sun was sitting in his normal spot by the fire pit, Thorn bowed to the middle-aged man.\"Thank you very much for your instruction yesterday, master. Would you be able to help me clear up an issue I have been wondering about?\"\"Hey, kid, it is way too early in the morning to be doing the whole 'master and apprentice' thing, so cool it. It's like what, seven?\"\"Umm. It is 11:43.\"\"See, it's still morning. Definitely too early. Anyway, what was your question?\"\"Ah, right.\" Seeing that Master Sun was changing the subject in embarrassment, Thorn moved on to his question. \"Yesterday, when I was fighting against the earth elementals, I could not even hurt them. With a weapon that is supposed to rely on pure force, what do I do when my force is not enough?\"\"Eh, that's your question? Get stronger, of course. Listen, kid, the tetsubo is a man's weapon,\" said Master Sun, pointing to one of his massive arms. \"If you can't crush someone or something, you practice until you can. Now, part of your problem is that the weapon you are wielding isn't heavy enough for you, but, where direct strength fails, use a force multiplier.\"Standing up, he walked over to a tree and put one of his hands on it. \"Look, if I push this tree from a stationary position, the amount of strength I can convert into force is minimal at best. But what if I use a force multiplier, like speed?\" Stepping back, Master Sun threw a lightning fast punch, sending splinters flying.\"See, by multiplying my force, my destructive potential goes up exponentially! If you are having trouble crushing something, you first try crushing it harder. But, if that doesn't work, find a force multiplier.\"\"Ah, so speed is actually the key,\" mused Thorn.\"Exactly. Anyone who uses a tetsubo is someone who is confident in their strength. But what sets apart the masters from the scrubs is how quickly they can swing their weapon and how smoothly they can transition between forms and grips to make use of their force and counterforce.\"\"Thank you, Master Sun.\" Thorn bowed again.\"I thought I told you that it is too early for that sort of stuff? Whatever. When you think you are ready, head over to the gorge. You still need to get across it.\"Bowing again, Thorn picked up his tetsubo, and, beginning to practice his spins and hand positions, he left for the gorge. Having been there before, the way was still marked on his map, so it did not take him long to get there. Like the day before, the gorge was quiet and peaceful, but Thorn knew firsthand that appearances were deceiving. Taking a deep breath, Thorn mentally prepared himself and then stepped forward, throwing himself at the awakening elementals. That evening, Thorn dragged his bruised and aching body back to camp, collapsing in a heap by the fire pit. He had actually made less progress through the gorge than he had yesterday, but he was not discouraged. He could feel his swings getting smoother and his transitions getting quicker.Over the next four days, a strange sort of mania set in. Rising early, Thorn would practice the various tetsubo moves at the camp before running over to the gorge to smash himself against the earth elementals, then hobbling back to camp to recover from his wounds. Each day, he pushed further into the gorge than the day before, if only a little. Slowly, he was refining his practical understanding of the whirling tetsubo forms.On the fifth day, he arrived at the gorge and dove in, unaware that two figures watched him from a ridge.\"Crazy, huh?\" muttered Hamm, staring down at Thorn, who was deflecting massive stone fists as he pushed forward.\"Crazy doesn't even begin to cover it,\" responded Master Sun. \"That kid is a monster. A certified monster. I mean, look at him. He can take a full force blow from an earth elemental without falling over. That, in and of itself, is enough to make him an absurd warrior. But, when you add decent comprehension and unreal strength to the mix..\" He trailed off, his eyes fixed on Thorn, who was struggling with three earth elementals which had come at him together.Hamm smirked, saying nothing.\"He might have a chance,\" said Master Sun abruptly, earning himself an incredulous look from the sword trainer. \"Listen. That kid is new to this whole fighting thing. In fact, based on his movements, it's pretty obvious that he is holding back for some reason. Look at his awkward attacks. For some reason, he is subconsciously afraid of using his strength. If he ever learns to let it out and gets his hands on a decent weapon, woe be upon anything that is in his way.\"\"There's no way. No one can fight that thing. All of us working together couldn't beat it. He might be big, but there's no way.\" Hamm shook his head.\"Hmph. Wait and watch.\"In the gorge, Thorn had fallen into a strange rhythm. Each step he took, each spin of his weapon, seemed to fit into a violent dance. His partners, the earth elementals, still roared their challenge at him, but there was a joy underneath the gravely sound. Together they danced back and forth, this way and that. That evening, when Thorn got back to the camp, Master Sun was waiting for him, a massive pack sitting next to him.\"Hey, kid, I've got to get going. I've taught you what you need to know, so now it is a matter of practicing it, alright?\" Master Sun took a swig from his bottle of wine.Despite his exhaustion and bruised body, Thorn stood in front of Master Sun and bowed.\"Thank you, sir,\" he said.\"Haha, don't worry about it.\" Standing, Master Sun finished off the wine and tossed the bottle to the side. Picking up the huge pack, he adjusted it on his shoulder and smiled at his enormous student. \"Oh, one other thing. My classes cost 10 gold a day. We've been at it for six days, so that's 60 gold. You can pay Hamm.\"Thorn's mouth dropped open in shock.\"Haha, or,\" said Master Sun, dragging it out, \"you can get to the end of the gorge. I'll waive the fee if you can pass all the way through by sunset tomorrow. Anyway, see you later, kid.\"With a wave, Master Sun disappeared from the camp, leaving Thorn in stunned silence. Sixty gold? It would take forever to work that off! Even killing Gargish, a unique boss monster, had only given him 10 gold! Resolving once again to get through the gorge, Thorn lay down. Tomorrow his body would be healed, and his motivation was stronger than ever.Unlike the previous days, the early morning sun found Thorn standing outside the elemental's gorge. If he was going to get through it in a day, he needed as much time as he could get.'Alright, let's do this.' Psyching himself up, Thorn gripped his tetsubo and rushed forward, not waiting for the first elementals to form. Getting as far into the gorge as he could before the elementals were together was a dangerous bet, but it was the only thing Thorn could think of to give himself an advantage.", "Rumbling to their feet, the earth elementals roared out their gleeful greeting and rushed toward him, fists swinging. The first elemental to reach Thorn was tossed aside with a deflecting blow, as were the second, third, and fourth. But, as the fifth set of fists came in, Thorn found himself unable to fully deflect it in time.Accepting the blow, Thorn angled his tetsubo to throw it off course and jumped back, using the momentum as it glanced off his weapon, trying to minimize the damage as much as possible. Escaping the crush of bodies, Thorn tried to dart around the group, but by this time, there were too many earth elementals around him.\u00a0The gorge was not that long, only half a mile in length. Yet, somehow, those 2600 feet seemed to stretch on forever. The earth elementals had large bodies and created a natural stone barrier as they crowded around to try and get a blow on Thorn.Finally, after a few hours of struggling, Thorn backed out of the gorge. Reaching the other end by rushing through was not going to work, so Thorn sat down and ate a bit as he thought about his experiences. For some reason, the last few days had been harder than the first couple of times he attempted to get through.It was almost as if there were more elementals now. A quick count revealed that there were the same number as always, so why did it feel like there were more elementals in the gorge than before? Laying down and gazing at the cloud-dotted sky, Thorn tried to remember his first fights. When he had first entered the gorge, he had taken a lot of punches straight on, since he had not mastered the constant momentum that Master Sun taught.Over time, he had gotten much better, but, at the same time, the punches seemed to come faster and thicker. What was going on? Despite thinking on it for twenty minutes, Thorn made no progress in figuring it out, so he shrugged, got up and headed back into the gorge. Still distracted as he faced the first earth elemental, Thorn missed his deflecting blow with his tetsubo!The earth elemental's stone fist caught Thorn in the chest, causing him to stagger back a couple steps. Frustrated and angry, Thorn growled, letting loose with a furious swing. As he began to pour power into the strike, he did not think about his form or his follow up, smashing out with all his strength.[CRACK!]With a sharp roar, the elemental crumbled to the ground, pieces of its stone body bouncing off the valley floor, leaving Thorn staring at his tetsubo in shock. As he had let go of his form, a strength that he had never felt before surged through his arms into his weapon, completely crushing through the earth elemental, leaving it in pieces on the ground. However, as he watched, the elemental's head continued to tremble, and the bouncing pieces of its broken body began to reform.Seeing the yellow glow in its eyes, Thorn realized that he would have to crush its head to kill it. For a moment, he hesitated, his tetsubo raised. Lowering it again, Thorn could not bring himself to take the swing. The elementals had been his sparring partners for almost a week, and something in him loathed the thought of actually hurting them.That moment of hesitation cost him, as the second earth elemental came roaring in, fists swinging. Jumping backward, Thorn instinctively deflected the blows, whirling around and unleashing another wild strike.[CRACK!]The second earth elemental shared the same fate as the first. Instead of backing up, Thorn, feeling like he was on the edge of grasping something vital, threw himself forward into the oncoming wave. Striking out with wild abandon, Thorn found at least half of his strikes either missing or glancing off the elemental's stone bodies. However, for every strike that missed, another laid an earth elemental low.Soon the familiar back and forth dance turned into a slow slaughter. Thorn pushed forward again and again into the waves of elementals, crashing through them with swing after swing, only to be pushed back as the stone fists pummeled him. In the midst of one such exchange, Thorn felt something click for him, and he instinctively switched between the whirling defensive forms he had been learning from Master Sun, swinging out with a formless strike, smashing through an elemental's body. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a massive fist coming toward him and, with a neat turn, spun back into his defensive form.'This is what Master Sun was talking about!' Thorn thought as he warded off the elemental's strikes. 'Defense turning into offense!'Excited by his discovery, Thorn tried to replicate the process, only to miss a block and take a punch right to his face, sending him reeling back. Swearing to himself, he squared up again and smashed the offending elemental into pieces. Working out the balance was a slow, laborious, and above all, painful process of trading blows, yet little by little, Thorn began to find his equilibrium.The sun was starting to sink in the sky, the tall pines casting long shadows across the gorge when Thorn finally pushed past the last elemental. About halfway through the gorge, the first elementals he had fought had finished reforming and roared in to attack him from behind, forcing him to defend for a couple of desperate moments. He quickly regained his balance and continued smashing his way through the elementals until he reached this point.The dust finally began to settled, as Thorn found himself at the other end of the gorge, on a slight slope leading out from between the hills and into the trees. Taking a moment to breathe, Thorn looked back over the field of pulverized stone and glowing elemental eyes. Though sore, he felt good. Very good. However, as he began to turn around, a subtle vibration sent the settled dust hopping into the air. His brow furrowed as he saw the yellow eyes of the elementals he had put down blur and begin to gather.The unnatural vibration seemed to draw the elemental eyes in, yellow glowing dots leaving streaks through the air, all gathering together into a ball. As the hundreds of eyes piled into each other, they began to compress, growing brighter as they did so. Faster and faster, they collapsed into each other, until they formed a bright glowing dot that floated off the ground. The yellow glow had gotten so bright it was almost too bright to look at.Putting up a hand to protect his eyes from the glaring light, Thorn tightened his grip on his tetsubo. After a moment, the brightness faded, and Thorn was able to look at the elemental light, which now resembled a polished piece of amber. As he watched, the gem floated toward him, pulsing with light. Watching the approaching gem, Thorn considered trying to knock it down with his tetsubo, but, just as he tightened up his grip for a swing, the floating amber pulsed, and a deep, gravelly voice rumbled in his mind.\"Greetings, great warrior!\" the voice boomed. \"You have shown strength and ferocity but, also, compassion! For that, I thank you!\"\"Uh, yeah. No problem,\" said Thorn, still holding his tetsubo ready.\"Hah, no need to be concerned, young warrior. I bring you no danger! I am Terberus, the Earth King! As great Terra commands, I must reward those who defeat my daughters!\" Here Thorn could almost see a barrel-chested old man waving his hand at the piles of rubble Thorn's rampage through the gorge had left. Thorn lowered his weapon and scratched his head.\"Ah, sorry about that. I hope it is not too much trouble for them to put themselves back together.\"\"Do not worry, young warrior. It is their honor to be challenged and your honor to have triumphed! For the mercy of sparing their lives, you have my thanks!\" rumbled the voice, like two boulders being ground against each other. \"As the victor, you have every right to collect their cores as spoils, but, by showing mercy, you have earned yourself a great favor! Behold, I grant unto you a boon! Your path will be long and treacherous, but the powerful embrace of the earth will be your shield, Friend of the Earth!\"Before Thorn could react, the floating piece of amber spun and drilled its way into the center of Thorn's brow! Horrified, he tried to block it, but the stone slipped through his hand and seeped into his skull! Feeling no blood, Thorn looked around, but the light was gone, leaving only the echoes of the rumbling voice as evidence that it had ever been there.For a moment, Thorn had no idea what to do, but everything in the gorge had gone back to normal, and the voice was gone. Seeing a blinking icon indicating an update to his status page, Thorn opened it up to take a look. Seeing a new title, Thorn opened it up to examine it. Grumbling about Nova Terra's useless explanations, Thorn waved the windows away and sat under a tree. It was getting dark, and he was exhausted. He had spent the afternoon smashing through almost a hundred earth elementals, and his body was aching. The hits from the elementals had not been too bad, once he got used to them, and, frankly, most of the blows had been deflected away, as it was.Rather, the pain in his body was from overusing his muscles for almost eight hours of straight swinging. While the game mechanics made the weight of the tetsubo negligible, he couldn't get around the fact that he had been swinging it as hard as he could over and over again. His shoulders ached, and he could feel a burning pain in his arms.As was his habit, Thorn thought back over the last few days. Master Sun had opened up an astounding path for him, providing a practical style that used his mighty strength and endurance to stunning effect. The martial arts training that he had gone through over the years had been useful for killing corrupted wolves and gave Thorn a strong foundation from which to build, but his size became a hindrance to him in using a sword to maximum effect.On the other hand, Master Sun's unique style was better suited to his size and strength. Frowning, Thorn realized that he didn't actually know what the style was called. Musing for a couple of minutes, Thorn tried to come up with a good name that was not too cheesy, but, after rejecting 'Raging Storm Strikes,' he quit trying. Coming up with names was not his strong suit.His combat against the elemental had been a growing experience. Their blows, though powerful, had not been too dangerous. Thorn shuddered as he imagined what would have happened to him if they had been swinging sharp claws, instead of blunt, rocky fists. Gargish, while not as strong as the earth elementals, had brought him much closer to death because of the piercing nature of his attacks.If each of them had been like Gargish, Thorn would have been shredded before he even started to fight back! Not all the creatures in this world were as scary as Gargish. While he had come out alive from his encounter with Gargish, it had been much closer than he had liked. On the other hand, after making it through the earth elemental's gorge, Thorn felt much more confident. He felt that, if he encountered Gargish now, not only would he be able to put up a good fight, but he even had a decent chance of winning!*ding*A low tone alerted Thorn to the fact that he had a video message request from Mina. Smiling, he opened the window and greeted her.\"Hey, Mina! What's going on?\"\"Heya! How are you? We're almost back from our guild mission! Finally! This mission has been a total pain, and I'm so glad to be done. It has taken forever, and it was su-u-uper boring. Plus, Jorge is a total pain and has been, like, grumpy this whole time.\" As the familiar torrent of words flowed out of the short girl's mouth, Thorn could not help but smile. It had been a bit more than a week since they had interacted, and he had missed her rapid-fire conversation. Used to being alone, Thorn had not anticipated how much he would come to enjoy engaging with others, but hearing Mina prattle on made his heart warm.\"So, anyway, Ouroboros asked me to tell you that we are heading back to Berum to complete the next part in our quest, and, if you are free, we would like to bring you along. Plus, there's a chance that there's a class change, which would be perfect for you, since you don't have a class yet, unless you got a class since we last met, but you shouldn't have because Ouroboros said that he told you to hold off.\" Her face red from saying all of that in one breath, Mina paused to breathe in, allowing Thorn to jump into the conversation for the first time since it started.\"Yeah, that sounds great. I have not...\"\"Oh, wonderful! You're so big and strong that you can carry waaaay more than the other porters we used,\" Mina interrupted when she had finished breathing. \"The porters on our last job were terrible. I mean they couldn't hold even a quarter of the stuff you could hold, and they were all so boring to talk to, it was pathetic.\"Sending a chat message to Ouroboros, Thorn left the call with Mina open and began making his way back to Berum. It took him a couple of hours to get back to the city, and it wasn't until he could see the stone walls surrounding Berum that Mina finally stopped chattering and said goodbye. They had agreed to meet at the same tavern as they had eaten at previously, but Thorn still had a day to kill, so he first stopped by the armorer who had made his custom armor.", "\"Welcome to the Knight's...\" Like the first time Thorn had entered, the shopkeeper was so stunned by the sight of Thorn squeezing into his shop that he trailed off in the middle of his sentence. \"Uh...Shield.\"\"You do repairs, right?\" said Thorn, laying his armor on the counter.\"Yeah, yeah, we do repairs. We can repair anything.\" Nodding, the armorer spread the massive suit of armor out, tsk-tsking to himself as he saw the extensive damage. Most of the hardened leather plates were covered in deep gouges or split from where Gargish's claws had cut through them. Likewise, the plate metal was either punctured or crumpled in on itself, and the chain portions were bent and ripped from where the earth elementals' stone fists had smashed into them.\"I take it back. We can't repair this. Okay, we could, but it would cost more to repair it than to make a whole new one. What did you do, walk into a nest of elementals? I would recommend scrapping this and getting a new set. I still have the plans I drew up for these, so I'd be happy to make you another set.\"\"That sounds good.\" Thorn nodded.\"Excellent. I thought you might come back, so I already have a couple of pieces I was going to use to repair any damage. The design is already done, so it shouldn't take me long to put the new suit together. Stop back tomorrow morning, and I'll have it for you.\"Thanking the armorer, Thorn ducked out of the store and made his way over to the mercenary supply store to pick up some more bolts for his arbalest. It had served him very well when he was fighting the corrupted wolves, and he imagined it would serve him even better when he was working as a porter for Ouroboros and the rest of the group. The last time he had worked with them, he spent a lot of time at the back doing nothing. This way he would at least be able to contribute a little.Then again, they worked very well as a group and, so far, had shown no need of any help. The more he learned about Nova Terra, the more clearly he realized the powerful impact that classes had on the game. Without a class, Thorn was still very strong. But imagine if he had special abilities on top of that? Just a single category class would have made his fight with Gargish a hundred times easier. Even something as simple as a Warrior's [Charge] ability could have allowed him to close the distance when Gargish attempted to jump away, or a Knight's [Armor Mastery], which would have made his armor ignore 30% of Gargish's damage. To say nothing of the abilities of a Mage or Warlock, who had various means of crowd control at their disposal. If not for Ouroboros mentioning that the new quest would have a dual category class, Thorn would have gone and gotten a basic class ages ago. Plus, Mina had mentioned that, to join Ragnarok, the minimum requirement was to have a dual category class. Few elite players had earned theirs by mastering their first class, so the guild mostly accepted people who started with a dual category class.Though Ouroboros had never explicitly mentioned anything to Thorn, he had hinted that, if Thorn were to meet the basic requirements of the guild, Ragnarok would love to have him. It seemed that dual category class players who could still act as a porter were rare, which put Thorn in a great position. After all, who wouldn't want a porter who could also fight?The next morning, Thorn picked up his armor from the Knight's Shield. This time the armorer had added thin metal plates under most of the hardened leather plates to try and give Thorn a bit more protection from whatever had slashed through them last time. The darkened metal pieces of the armor and the chainmail underneath were new. The armorer had offered to upgrade the materials to a stronger alloy, but Thorn did not have the money for it, so they were still steel.Putting the armor back on, Thorn left the Knight's Shield and went to turn in his bounty. He had killed a huge number of corrupted wolves, and his bags were stuffed with stacks of their tails. Once his quest was turned in, Thorn still had a bit of time, so he decided to swing by the Forge Quarter and see about getting his tetsubo repaired. While it was still in good shape, breaking apart earth elementals had put some strain on it. Somewhere along the way, it had developed a slight bend.When Thorn first pulled it out, he placed the head of the tetsubo on the ground and held it up straight to show the bend. Nodding, the dwarven smith grabbed the handle and tried to lift it off the ground, only to stagger under its weight. Thorn had been handling the weapon with ease so the smith misjudged the weight of the pure metal tetsubo. Looking at Thorn in respect, he called a couple other smiths over, and between them, they got the tetsubo into the forge and started heating it. It took three dwarven NPCs almost four hours to straighten it out and re-anneal it to make sure it was as strong as before. Once they had finished, Thorn paid them and picked it up as if it was a stick, swinging it a couple times before putting it away in his inventory. Now that he was dressed in armor, not the beginner clothes, Thorn looked like an experienced player, and he found it much easier to walk through town. It was subtle, but the presence he gave off since fighting Gargish and the earth elementals was stronger than when he had started the game. This new aura caused people to instinctively move out of his way when he walked.The meeting at the tavern was scheduled for lunch, so Thorn went ahead and ordered when he got there. By the time the others arrived, there was a steady stream of dishes coming out to the table. Used to seeing the mounds of food that Thorn consumed, Jorge and Velin sat down and started digging in, after waving a hello. Mina, on the other hand, bounced over to him and tried to give him a hug. Startled, Thorn patted her on the back. Due to their size difference, Mina's arms didn't make it much more than halfway across his chest. Like the others, she soon quieted down and started shoveling food into her mouth. Smiling at the other three, who had descended on the table like they were starving, Ouroboros clapped Thorn on the shoulder before sitting down.\"You're looking good, Thorn,\" Ouroboros said, filling up his plate. \"The armor looks great on you.\"\"About time ya stopped looking like a noob,\" mumbled Jorge around a mouthful of food.\"Yeah? When are you going to stop acting like a jerk?\" Mina jumped in to defend Thorn before he could respond. \"Forget him, Thorn. He's mad because he ranked last in our guild quest.\"\"Oh, come off it. You only beat me by two points, and only because I let you.\"\"Enough, you two. You are giving me indigestion.\" Velin silenced them with a glare. Giving Thorn a small smile, she sighed. \"It would have been much easier if you had come along, Thorn. I never missed having a pure support class so much.\"\"What did you do on the guild quest?\" Thorn took the chance to ask.\"An ore run,\" said Ouroboros, taking over the conversation. \"Ragnarok has a production class wing, and they need huge amounts of resources to do their thing. But, because they are squishy, they get PK'd all over the place. So, every month, the guild assigns a day for teams to help the production squad gather materials. This time we were on an ore run. We had to collect a metric ton of ore of various types from drops. It's pretty boring, but it has to be done.\"\"PK?\" Thorn had never run across the term.\"Player Kill. People attack them and take all their stuff.\"\"Seriously? How is that allowed?\" Thorn asked, shocked. \"What do you mean, how is that allowed?\" Mina asked, looking at him. \"Nova Terra is a full player versus player game. People kill each other all the time. Have you never been attacked by a bandit before?\"\"Does Thorn look like someone a bandit would attack?\" asked Jorge with a chuckle.\"Good point,\" Mina conceded.\"So, killing people is okay?\" Being new to these sorts of games, Thorn was having trouble wrapping his head around this change in perspective.\"It depends,\" Velin cut in before Mina could respond. \"There are a surprising number of players who use their freedom in game to attack others and steal their belongings because there is no permanent penalty for death. The only negative consequence, apart from a twelve-hour logout and some dropped loot, is that you lose some of your class mastery, so death has very little weight. There are much worse things than death.\"For a moment, the table was quiet, as Thorn tried to work through the logic behind this. His aunt had always taught him to treat people well, so the idea that it might be okay to fight and kill without regard for others was a bit difficult to deal with. Seeing his frown, Ouroboros patted him on the shoulder.\"Not everyone plays that way, Thorn. There are some bad apples in every bunch, but that's why we protect those who can't protect themselves. In fact, there were three attacks while we were hunting for ore.\"\"Better to kill bandits than the stupid elementals.\" Taking a deep drink, Jorge wiped his mouth off with the back of his hand before continuing to complain. \"I've put in who knows how many requests that they don't assign us to fight those stupid rocks. Why can't we get a herb run or something like that? At least I could stab the bandits who try to steal from us.\"\"He is sore because his knives don't work on elementals,\" laughed Mina.\"Anyway, we are one of the only groups without a porter, so it takes us a couple of trips to get enough ore.\" Ouroboros patted Thorn on the shoulder again. \"Hopefully we can change that soon.\"Seeing that Thorn was still consuming the food on the table at a fantastic rate, the others settled into eating. Dish after dish came out under the astounded gaze of the other patrons, but Thorn never slowed. It was not that he ate quickly; rather, he consumed whole plates of food in a couple bites. He could eat half a chicken in two bites and a loaf of bread in three. Whole plates of pasta were swallowed down in less than a minute. Even if he took his time, the food disappeared at break-neck speed.It was almost an hour later when the group finally finished their meal and settled down to business. Mina had ordered a desert, and Ouroboros and Velin were drinking coffee while Jorge stuck with another ale. Thorn was drinking water, since alcohol had next to zero effect on him, given his size and the speed with which his metabolism worked. He did not mind alcohol, but the water was free, and he had already spent almost a whole gold on food today.\"Let's get down to business.\" Putting down his coffee, Ouroboros pulled out a small, white sphere and set it up on the table. Pushing a button on the top, a translucent force field expanded from it to surround the table, cutting off the sound from the rest of the tavern and blurring them from view with a swirling mist. Pulling out a map, he spread it across the table and pointed to a large valley to the north of the city.\"This is where we completed the kobold extermination quest. It went much faster than expected, thanks to Thorn here, and we not only managed to clear some villages, but we also took down the kobold chieftain and a Greater Shaman. We all know - well, most of us know, that a mob Shaman doesn't become a Greater Shaman without there being an inheritance of some sort nearby. Well, I did a bit of digging, and I've figured out where the inheritance is based.\"You'll notice that the valley is a large cul-de-sac with only one entrance, right? Actually, if you check old maps, that doesn't seem to have always been the case.\" Pulling out another map, Ouroboros laid it over top of the first map. Drawn on transparent paper, it soon became apparent that there was a small canyon running off of the valley to the northeast.\"I'm not sure what happened to close the entrance, but, according to my research, this is where the Shaman found an inheritance to turn into a Greater Shaman. At the worst, we should find a class change altar and some loot. However, that brings us to our next piece of research. Take a look at the name of the canyon.\"\"Davyos' Fall?\" read Mina. \"What does that have to do with anything?\"\"Nothing, except that Davyos was a famous Devil Blood Berserker from the God's Era.\" Seeing Thorn's confused look, Ouroboros smiled and explained. \"The world of Nova Terra has gone through three different eras. As you can imagine, they are named in order. We are currently living in the beginning of the Fourth Era, the Traveler's Era. However, Nova Terra has a lot of history from before players ever entered the game. Each Era was long. Like, thousands of years long.\"The First Era is also called the God's Era. It was a time when warlords rose and fell, and massive creatures roamed around eating everything in sight. Countless powerful people and creatures died during that time, leaving their inheritances behind. During this time, the basics of civilization started to be built out of the wilderness. It's called the God's Era because it is said that the gods played a monumental game with the races of the world. They chose members of the various races to become their avatars. They blessed them, granting their avatars fantastic power and pitting them against each other.\"After the God's Era came the Dragon's Era. Powerful elemental dragons emerged and brought the land under their spurred heels. They enslaved the other races and waged massive wars on each other. Most of the gods' avatars had fallen, by this point, and the dragons plundered the inheritances for their own followers. They took the inheritances of the chosen and granted them to their own chosen. The dragons began to behave like the gods before them, sitting high above the world while pitting their chosen against each other. But the races couldn't be kept down forever, which led to the Third Era.\"", "\"The Imperial Era started when two powerful chosen, a demonkin and a human, defied their masters, after falling in love. Leading a massive slave army, they rose up and defeated the dragons, unifying the entire world under the twin banner of humanity and demonkin. Their son was the first emperor. The Imperial Era was an era of peace and prosperity, but, under the surface, a growing fight brewed.\"See, the first emperor was half and half. His dad was a demonkin, his mom was human. But every child after that had either more human blood or more demonkin blood. The intrigue created because of that caused an unhealable rift, and the empire was torn in half in a bloody civil war. The demonkin took the southern half of the continent, and us humans took the northern half. The Imperial Era ended with the arrival of the first travelers.\"As I was saying earlier, Davyos was a Devil Blood Berserker from the God's Era. As far as we know, he was the avatar of Karrandaras, a powerful archdevil who ruled over blood and corruption. Other people have explored this area before, but they didn't find anything. I'm guessing that, somehow, the inheritance was uncovered by the kobolds, which let the Shaman become a Greater Shaman.\"\"Wait, you're saying there might be a triple category class there?\" asked Mina in disbelief. \"Honestly, I doubt it,\" said Ouroboros, shaking his head. \"The chance of it being a triple category class is abysmal. Most of the ancient inheritances from the God's Era were plundered by the dragons ages ago, so it is unlikely that such a high profile class would have slipped through. I mean, there are close to three billion players and only four triple category classes. All of which, by the way, were picked up from massive chain quests that took whole guilds to complete.As far as we know, the Devil Blood Berserker class was a mix between a Devil Warlock, a Blood Shaman, and a Blood Warrior. What I am hoping for is a dual category class stone that can be used to form one of those classes. Most of the avatars from the First Era had retinues of dual category classes, which means there is a pretty solid chance that we can get at least one dual class, if not a whole set.\"\"Then what are we waiting for?\" asked Jorge, downing the rest of his ale. \"Let's get rolling.\"\"Oh, now you're interested in working?\" Mina said with a sneer. \"Where was this excitement when we were on our ore run?\"As Jorge was about to fire back, Ouroboros grabbed his shoulder. \"Cut it out, you two. Thorn, if you're willing to act as a porter for us, there is a good chance we should be able to get you a dual category class.\" Ouroboros rolled up the two maps and then looked at Thorn. \"It might be very dangerous. Especially so, since you don't have a class, but the potential reward is huge. What do you think?\"\"I'm in!\" declared Thorn, slapping the table in excitement.*BOOM*With a loud crash, the table splintered into pieces and collapsed onto the ground, sending everyone's cups flying!\"What the!\" Jorge yelled as he jumped to his feet, swearing. Likewise, Mina scrambled backward, flipping her chair over as she did. Even Ouroboros jumped up in surprise. Only Velin did not react, looking at Thorn and raising her eyebrows.\"Sorry, sorry,\" stammered Thorn, as surprised as everyone else.It took a moment for everyone's surprise to settle down. The pyramid of silence that Ouroboros had set up was still deployed, so the rest of the tavern had no idea that Thorn had crushed a table with a simple slap. The swirling mist had also blocked the splinters, saving the surrounding patrons from a storm of flying wood.\"Goodness, don't scare me like that.\" Mina clutched her chest. \"My heart is beating a hundred miles an hour!\"\"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that,\" Thorn apologized again as the others stared at him. Once everyone had calmed down, Ouroboros picked up the pyramid of silence and paid the tavern owner for the ruined table before herding everyone out. Ouroboros gave everyone an hour to do what they needed before meeting at the north gate. Since Thorn had already restocked on all his supplies and gotten his tetsubo fixed, he decided to head to the gate where the party was going to meet. Once the group had finished getting ready, they left the city and headed into the mountains to the north. After a few hours of travel, they arrived at the entrance to the large valley where they had fought the kobolds previously. Seeing the familiar land stretching out before them, Thorn could not help but smile. This is where he had gotten to know his new friends, so it held a special place in his heart.Rather than immediately pushing into the valley, Ouroboros had everyone set up camp to rest for the night. At first, Thorn had found it strange that players kept to a normal night and day schedule in Nova Terra, considering the time dilation, but he quickly realized that the amount of information that a person had to process grew along with the stretching time.While it was possible to push through for multiple days, players found that they had a better experience when they slept. Plus, it wasn't like they were losing much time. Seven hours of in-game sleep was an hour of real time. It was like taking a small break before carrying on. Most players actually logged out when their character rested, Mina and the others being no exception. Since Thorn couldn't actually log out, he went to bed like normal. There was little difference between his sleep and a player who had logged out, so Thorn set an alarm to wake him up when the others logged back in and closed his eyes. The system assisted the process, and he fell asleep almost instantly.When his alarm went off the next morning, Thorn got up and packed up his tent. Ouroboros, Mina, and Jorge had already logged in and helped Thorn break camp while they waited for Velin. Once the camp was cleaned up, Thorn got out some breakfast and passed it out. After half an hour, Velin logged in and greeted everyone.\"Did you find anything?\" Ouroboros asked, brushing some crumbs from his fingers as he walked over to her. Nodding, Velin handed over a document. \"It looks like we have some competition. We need to pick up the pace,\" she said. \"The others have made tangible progress, which means more pressure on you.\"\"Alright, we better head out,\" said Ouroboros, after scanning the document. Putting it away with a frown, he looked off into the distance for a couple moments before gathering everyone up. By the time he was facing the others, he was back to his normal self, and, without further delay, they started on their way.Thorn and the others had been too far away to hear the exchange, so they set out in high spirits. Like the first time they came into the valley, Jorge acted as a vanguard, clearing the way for them. Unlike their previous venture, they met kobolds more often, though in smaller groups.Mina explained that, because the Greater Shaman was dead, the kobolds were not as unified anymore and were ranging farther from their villages. For a normal player, this made the valley a much easier hunting ground. Most of the kobolds they came across were in small bands of three or four, allowing the team to breeze through them.Despite his anticipation that he would be able to display his new weapons, Thorn found himself following along as Mina handled the kobolds with a quick spell. Jorge took care of any groups of less than three while a single blizzard spell wiped out groups of three to four. The one time they came across a group of six, Mina cast two blizzard spells on top of each other, decimating the group before Thorn could even get his arbalest out. Seeing his frustration, Velin patted him on the shoulder, while Ouroboros chuckled.\"Don't worry, you'll get a chance to fight,\" the Guardian assured Thorn. \"In fact, we are getting close to the canyon. We'll be there for a while, and the respawn rate is going to be higher than in a normal spot, since it is so close to the main kobold camp.\"Sure enough, they soon arrived at the narrow entrance to a small canyon. This was the spot marked on the original map that had been lost. Jorge cleared the two kobolds who were hanging out at the entrance of the canyon and walked back to the group, tossing the gear they had dropped to Thorn.\"Alright, this is the spot. Inside, we'll be looking for a passage or entrance to the rest of the canyon that has been blocked off. It's been a little while, so I'm guessing that there should be another kobold shaman spawned. Even if they have been upgraded to a Greater Shaman, we don't have much to worry about,\" said Ouroboros, looking at the ancient map.\"Jorge, you lead the way, like normal. Mina, Thorn, you two can help him search. Since we are going to be stuck between the entrance, that we haven't found yet, and the main kobold village, I'm expecting that we will need to fight off some waves, which means you need to hurry. This is a good choke point, so Velin and I will camp here to block off any reinforcements. Any questions?\"\"Yeah, if I find the entrance before Jorge does, shouldn't he finally admit that I am better than he is?\" asked Mina, sticking her tongue out at the dwarven rogue.\"Oh, come off it. There is no way you will find the entrance first. You haven't found anything before me since we started playing.\" Jorge smirked.Ouroboros rolled his eyes, ignoring them.\"Thorn, please do all of us a huge favor and find it before these two. Then they'll shut up for once,\" Velin said.\"No thanks, I have no desire to come between the two shorties,\" laughed Thorn.\"Shorties? Who's short?\" demanded Mina.\"Yeah, how about I cut you down to our height?\" threatened Jorge, brandishing one of his long daggers.\"Okay, that's enough. Let's get to work. We have company,\" said Ouroboros, pointing at a group of fifteen kobolds hurrying toward them.Like the professionals they were, the group immediately burst into action. Jorge faded from sight, hurrying to the right, while Mina cast a spell, sliding forward on the path of ice that formed under her feet. At the narrow canyon opening, Ouroboros pulled out his large shield and planted it into the ground in front of him. A bright, white glow fell on him, as Velin stood behind him and began to rain buffs on him.Thorn was caught by surprise by the immediate action everyone else took, and after standing there for a couple seconds, he turned and headed farther into the canyon to look for the entrance like the other two. As he left, he did not see the complicated look that Velin cast at his back.Rushing forward, the kobolds soon arrived at the canyon's narrow mouth and were about to swarm Ouroboros and Velin, when the Holy Guardian gave a great shout, his shield glowing. Looking over, the kobolds seemed to go mad as they saw the silver glowing shield. With growls and angry howls, they threw themselves forward, toward the planted shield.Bracing against his shield, Ouroboros weathered the impact before sliding the tower shield onto his back. Striking forth with a sweeping blow of his sword, Ouroboros bisected one of the kobolds. The following backhand forced the rest of the monsters back half a step, which Ouroboros immediately closed with a spin, replanting his tower shield into the ground with a firm thrust.As the tower shield hit the ground, it sent out a quaking wave, throwing the remaining kobolds off their feet. As they started to struggle up, Velin completed her chant. Sharp spears of light formed above the struggling clump of kobolds, stabbing down with deadly efficiency. Only two of the original ten kobolds made it out of the rain of light alive and were dispatched by Ouroboros' sword.After taking a moment to look through the loot the kobolds had dropped, Ouroboros leaned on his shield and stared back into the depths of the canyon. Velin, seeing the intense look of thought on his face, frowned.\"Are you starting to have second thoughts?\" asked Velin.\"No,\" Ouroboros shook his head. \"The whole thing is repulsive, but it is the only way we will be able to compete.\"\"Is it?\"\"Yes,\" said Ouroboros, his voice growing hard. \"There are only four in the world right now, and the bonuses can't be denied. There is no way to compete with the advantage they give. Even if it takes some sacrifice, it will be worth it.\"\"Even sacrifice at the expense of others?\"For a moment, Ouroboros' hard look softened, and he seemed to struggle with himself. Was it worth it?\"Yes, even at the expense of others.\" The Holy Guardian took a deep breath and closed his eyes. \"Sometimes, greatness requires us to put ourselves before others. And this is one of those cases.\"\"You sound like your dad.\"\"Ha,\" Ouroboros' shoulders slumped in defeat. \"I guess I do. I never thought I'd fall this low, but there isn't another option, at this point. I'm too far behind. This is the only way to catch up.\" \"Ultimately, this is a game. Is there a need to compromise like this?\"\"You don't understand, Velin. This might be a game, but in some ways, it is more real than real life,\" said Ouroboros, turning to face the new group of kobolds that were rushing over.", "Oblivious to the conversation behind him, Thorn combed through the canyon, looking for any sign of a hidden entrance. According to the information Velin had brought back, the canyon had most likely been blocked by a powerful spell that moved the earth from the canyon walls. New to the game, Thorn found all the lore quite interesting and had listened raptly as Ouroboros and Velin explained what they had discovered about the area.Some time back at the end of the God's Era, Davyos, the Devil Blood Berserker, had led what remained of his forces back into this canyon to flee from one of his enemies. Despite his class, Davyos was considered a cold, calculating general who never engaged in a fight he could not win. Faced with overwhelming odds, the Devil Blood Berserker had chosen to retreat to the temple, where he had been granted his power in the hopes that the Archdevil who had granted them would assist him.Like most avatars in the first era, Davyos had a mysterious history, shrouded by the fog of time. Little was known about his background, and it was only through paying Avalon for the information that Velin had been able to find out anything about the ancient figure. According to the report that she had received, Davyos had been a Wolfkin hunter who stumbled upon a temple deep in this canyon. After receiving the blessings of the Archdevil, Davyos had used his power to create a powerful mercenary group that completed tasks for the local warlords. A warlord more greedy than wise attempted to pay Davyos less than he owed, and Davyos led his men to slaughter the warlord and everyone around him. Claiming the warlord's territory for his own, Davyos began to consolidate power, his personal prowess paving the way for his territory's rapid expansion.All good things come to an end, and after almost twenty years of tyrannical rule, Davyos was attacked by an alliance of humans and elves. While he fought and inflicted serious casualties on his opponents, they were determined to rid the land of his influence and nibbled away at his territory until he was forced to flee back to the corrupted temple from which his powers had originated.According to the information that Velin had purchased, as the army was retreating, one of Davyos' most powerful followers called the land to collapse and, casting a prodigious spell at the cost of his own life, caused the canyon walls to be pinched shut, completely sealing the temple away. Over the years, a shift in the earth caused a path to be opened, once again revealing the temple to the world.Or so the team now hoped. Mina, Jorge, and Thorn were still looking everywhere for an entrance to the canyon as Ouroboros and Velin held off the continuous waves of kobolds. Despite examining every stretch of ground, the three of them had not found even a hint of a passageway. Over at the canyon mouth, the groups of kobolds were getting larger and larger, as more and more kobolds realized that there were intruders. Soon a howling mob had formed in front of Ouroboros.\"Any time now, guys!\" yelled Ouroboros over his shoulder. \"There is nothing here!\" Mina shouted in frustration, kicking a rock. \"We've looked all over this stupid canyon, and there isn't a blasted hole in sight!\"\"Well, look harder!\" Ouroboros snapped.Outside the canyon, the crowd of kobolds was starting to swell as the noise from the fight attracted them. At first, it was only ten or so kobolds rushing forth in each wave, but the waves got bigger and closer together. \"After a few minutes, the waves will merge into a constant stream of enemies,\" thought Ouroboros, cold sweat running down his back.\"Mina! Leave the searching to the others and come to support us!\"\"What? Why can't Jorge help you?\" Mina whined, only to be silenced by a glare from Velin. \"Fine.\" Rolling her eyes, she huffed her way over to the mouth of the canyon and raised her wand. A chill pervaded the air as countless snowflakes appeared. Muttering under her breath, Mina waved her wand again, pointing to a couple of the drifting flakes.Every snowflake Mina pointed to glowed a bright, icy blue and expanded before hurtling forth like an icy ninja star, cutting into a kobold! Deep gashes began appearing on the kobolds rushing to get around Ouroboros, the icy power freezing them and slowing them down even as the sharp ice blades cut their skin.While the number of kobolds had grown, the entrance to the canyon was so small that only ten kobolds could fit into it at a time. This narrow choke allowed Ouroboros to keep most of the kobolds back while Velin buffed him and dealt with the kobolds on his right. To his left, Mina's icy shurikens carved their way through any kobold that managed to slip past.Again and again, the kobolds surged forward. Despite their lack of armor, poor weapons, and weak strength, their sheer numbers began to take a toll on the three defenders. Beads of sweat began to appear on Mina's forehead as she sent icy blade after icy blade forward. Ouroboros had been breathing hard for a while, despite Velin's energizing spells. Even the elven War Priestess was beginning to drag.A quick look back showed that the two girls were approaching their limit, and Ouroboros knew he needed to make a decision. If Jorge and Thorn were not able to find the entrance to the hidden part of the canyon soon, they would have to call off the search and try to break out; otherwise, they would all be buried here. Slicing through the neck of another kobold, Ouroboros steeled his heart and opened his mouth to say something, only to leave it open in shock as a huge stone, almost twice his size, came hurtling over his head!Flying through the air, the massive boulder spun before crushing the rushing kobolds, sending them flying. With a sonic boom, it slammed into the ground, skidding a bit before stopping, raising a huge cloud of dust. Mina, Ouroboros, Velin, and Jorge all stared in shock at the huge stone that had seemed to appear out of nowhere. They didn't snap out of it until they heard a satisfied voice behind them.\"I found the entrance, but it is a bit small, so I'm widening it.\"Behind the group, Thorn had been searching through the rocks when he tripped over a log sticking out of the piled stones. When he stood back up, he noticed that the shifted log revealed a small space behind it. Digging out the surrounding rocks, Thorn realized that the entrance to the cave had been covered over with a pile of boulders, with an especially large one plugging up the opening.Especially large to anyone but Thorn, of course. Seeing that the pressure from the kobolds at the mouth of the canyon was growing, Thorn flexed his fingers and grabbed the boulder, pulling it out of its hole. Raising it over his head, Thorn tossed it over Ouroboros, smashing into the kobolds and narrowing the canyon entrance even further.The kobolds, terrified that it was now raining massive rocks, fled back out of the canyon, screaming, allowing some breathing room for the tired Holy Guardian and the two ladies. Wiping the sweat off her forehead, Mina ran over to examine the cave entrance.\"Do you think this is the one?\" she asked, peering inside.\"Only one way to find out, eh?\" replied Jorge, slipping past her into the cave. \"I'll check it out, boss.\"\"Ha, don't you dare,\" retorted Mina, dashing after him.Giving Thorn an appraising look, Velin walked after them. Embarrassed by Velin's attention, Thorn rubbed the back of his head and then followed Ouroboros into the cave. The ceilings of the tunnel were pretty high, so Thorn didn't have to duck. Much. The tunnel wove around for a bit before opening up into the rest of the canyon. From what Thorn could tell, the tunnel had been bored out by hand, over a long period of time, by the kobolds. This brightened up the party's spirits, as it meant that it was less likely that the dragons had discovered this ancient inheritance during the Second Era.Of course, the dragons had enslaved many of the lesser races, so it was possible that the tunnel had been dug on their orders, but, according to Velin, the dragons were strong enough to rip through the blockage in the canyon, so it was unnecessary for them to have their minions dig.Before they reached the entrance into the hidden canyon, Jorge made his way back to the group, carrying a body. Despite his short stature, his thick frame possessed significant strength, surprising Thorn. Careful to make as little noise as possible, Jorge put the body down on the ground and gestured to it.\"Hey, boss, check this out. This is one of the two guards that were hanging out ahead. After I took them down, I peeked around the corner and saw a big metal door. There were fifteen or so more of these wolf guys hanging out in front of it. There were two casters working on opening it up.\"\"Kobolds?\"\"Nah, they are not kobolds, or at least, they aren't any of the kobolds I've seen. Their armor and weapons are all high quality, and they stand a lot straighter than kobolds. Their faces are also different.\"\"Could they be a different type of kobold?\" asked Mina.\"Hmm, interesting. Look. Their fingers are clawed, but they have hands like humans, rather than paws, like kobolds.\" Poking the dead creature's hands with his sword, Ouroboros pointed them out. \"Wolfkin!\" blurted out Thorn.\"Wolfkin?\" the other four asked together.\"Yeah, I ran into another person like this,\" said Thorn, his brow furrowing as he remembered Gargish, the Blood Hunter. Like this body, Gargish was a mix between a wolf and human, having a generally human form with the head of a wolf.\"Hmm, tell us about it. Were they a mob?\" asked Ouroboros.\"Mob?\" asked Thorn, unfamiliar with the term.\"What a noob,\" Jorge muttered under his breath, as Mina rolled her eyes and chuckled.\"Ah, mobs are NPCs that don't have the same intelligence as the NPCs you interact with in town,\" explained Ouroboros with a wry smile.In Nova Terra, NPCs were categorized into two different classifications. Some NPCs, the monsters, were there to act as fodder for the players and friendly NPC factions. These NPCs had very basic AI and generally only existed in the game to be farmed for quests and loot. The kobolds were a good example of this. While a few of the kobolds with classes (like the Chieftains, Shaman, and Greater Shamans) were more advanced, the average kobold had very limited AI. The players referred to them as 'mobs' since they were mindless, and it was generally understood that interacting with them was pointless unless it was with a sharp object.On the other side of the coin were the natives, NPCs that had advanced AI and could reason, think, and scheme like the players. Natives were often no different than players, and it was generally very difficult to tell them apart. For the most part, players interacted with natives to get quests, advance their skills and progress in the game. While there was no proof of it, rumors had it that Eve, the AI that controlled Nova Terra, had the ability to transition mobs to natives, whenever it was convenient, in order to achieve the game's ends.\"No, he was definitely a native. A hostile native. Like, super hostile,\" said Thorn, remembering the mad struggle he had had with Gargish. \"He was a human who turned into a half wolf, half man, like these guys. Sort of a werewolf type of thing.\"\"Okay, so that means they are a new faction. Almost all native races can be played as characters, though some require unlocking, so this information is pretty valuable. Jorge, how tough were they?\"\"They were strong. I had to use both my clone and a mass silence to keep them from hitting the gong.\"\"I could have killed them faster,\" muttered Mina under her breath.\"Definitely a native faction, then. We'll have to hope there are not too many of them in here.\" Ouroboros ignored Mina and stood up, dusting off his hands. \"Let's keep going.\"Advancing farther down the tunnel, Jorge stayed ahead of the group while the rest moved in their normal formation. Ouroboros led the way, his shield held in front of him, with Mina a step behind, to his right. Spaced to the other side, Velin was a step behind Mina while Thorn brought up the rear, three steps back. Despite his assurances that he was okay fighting, the other four still treated him like he was a new player and positioned him at the back. At least, they didn't protest when he pulled out his arbalest and loaded in one of the massive bolts. In fact, Mina had doubled over in laughter at the sight of the massive weapon, and Jorge had made a couple sly comments.At least, Ouroboros hadn't laughed and had assigned Thorn to protect Velin. Excited by the thought of getting to participate, Thorn mentally vowed to fulfill his role well, despite the fact that Velin had the most survivable class out of the whole group.Turning a corner, they caught sight of Jorge, who was stopped up ahead. Slipping back to where the group was waiting, Jorge held up two fingers.\"Two casters, three heavy armor, the rest look like rangers of some sort. Long daggers and bows. At least ten. Heavies are carrying axes and shields. Casters are spouting some nonsense at a bronze door. Looks like a rune lock that they are trying to open,\" he whispered, drawing out the enemy's position on the ground.\"Let's go with formation six,\" Ouroboros ordered after a moment of thought. \"Jorge, you are on the casters. I'll hold down the heavies while the girls clear chaff.\"", "\"What about the big guy?\" asked Mina, glancing up at Thorn's excited face.\"Yeah, what can I do?\"\"Protect the girls, of course,\" said Ouroboros.\"Alright, sounds good.\"After affirming that everyone understood their role, Jorge moved behind Ouroboros while Mina and Velin pulled Thorn to stand between them, a few steps behind Jorge, who had taken out a purple salve to spread on his daggers. As quietly as they could, the group moved up the tunnel. Thorn tried to be quiet, but they had not even gotten halfway up when they heard voices, and a group consisting of an armored wolfkin and four of the rangers walked around the corner to see what was going on.As the groups caught sight of each other, the wolfkin yelled out in surprise, and Thorn pulled the trigger on his massive crossbow. With a piercing whistle, the bolt flew down the tunnel, stabbing into the armored wolfkin. A loud screech rang out as the metal tip of the bolt buried itself into his chest, punching straight through his metal breastplate and sending him tumbling head over heels.With incredible force, the armored wolfkin bowled the rangers over, knocking them all to the ground. For a moment everyone froze in utter shock. It was only when they heard the groan of the arbalest, as Thorn pulled back the string to load another bolt, that they snapped back to reality.\"Go!\" roared Ouroboros charging forward, his shield up. Like a shadow, Jorge dashed right after him, tucked behind his back. Mina continued to stare at Thorn, her mouth open, until Velin poked her in the shoulder with her staff. Shaking her head as they ran forward behind the charging Holy Guardian, Mina waved her wand, sending ice spikes into the heads of the rangers, who were still struggling to rise.Charging right past the struggling wolfkin, Ouroboros caught sight of the rest of the wolfkin, who were getting into formation. The two armored wolfkin stood out front, while the rest of the rangers stood in a rough half-circle behind them, their bows out. At the very back, the two casters had stopped working on opening the door and were readying spells. With another roar, Ouroboros accelerated, crossing the remaining distance in a flash. His shield up, he smashed into the two armored wolfkin, causing them to stumble back. As he impacted them, a shadow shot over his head, using his back and his shoulder to launch itself forward. Jorge, who had stuck close to Ouroboros, flew over the heads of the rangers toward the wolfkin mages in the back.The mage on the left abandoned his chant as he saw the dwarven rogue flying through the air toward him. Pulling a wand from inside his thick robe, he took aim at Jorge, muttering the triggering incantation. Bloody red lights formed at the tip before shooting toward Jorge. With a smirk, the dwarf pulled his cloak around him, disappearing from the air in a silent explosion of shadow, only to appear behind the other mage, who was still chanting.Two daggers thrust out at the mage who was still oblivious to the danger. As Jorge attacked, a thin barrier sprang up around the mage, blocking the oncoming daggers. Rather than panicking, Jorge smoothly slid his left-handed dagger forward. Shorter than his right-hand dagger, his left-hand dagger had a thicker blade with a jagged edge. Impacting the magical shield, it flashed a deep red, sending cracks shooting through the shield.His other dagger followed right behind, slipping through one of the many cracks that had appeared in the shield before cutting through the mage's heavy robe and into his ribs. The mage had barely registered the attack when his throat spasmed, cutting off his chant as the Throat Sealing poison that Jorge had spread on his daggers took effect. Occupied with the two armored wolfkin, Ouroboros had no time to worry about Jorge. While his initial charge was enough to knock both of them back, they recovered their footing and attacked. Lifting his shield, Ouroboros shifted to the left with a twist that allowed him to catch both attacks. Rather than going for the kill, he settled into a defensive stance and prepared to weather the storm.Before the rangers could choose which target to attack, a wave of magical energy washed over them. Ice spikes and golden feathers began to bombard them, sending them scrambling for cover. A few of the braver ones pulled out their daggers and dashed forward, trying to get close to the two girls who were casting spells, only to be driven back by Thorn's heavy swings. It took less than a moment for the battlefield to devolve into chaos, but, even to Thorn's untrained eye, it was obvious that the chaos was being skillfully controlled. Jorge's blitz had taken down one of the mages, and he was occupying the other with a relentless barrage of attacks while Ouroboros held the middle of the field, where the two armored wolfkin were stuck to him. Despite trying to retreat to help the mages, the armored wolfkin could not seem to break away from the Holy Guardian. Every time they would try to step back, he would shift his position and strike with his sword, forcing them to defend. Even when they attacked, trying to drive him back, he shifted his position. Soon they found themselves with their backs to Thorn and the girls, with Ouroboros in between them and the casters. The rangers milling about found themselves in an impossible situation. Every ranger that tried to approach Jorge had ice spikes shooting toward their heads. Those that tried to get involved with the melee in the middle were assaulted by golden blades shaped like feathers. Their only option seemed to be to try and attack the girls casting the spells, but that proved to be even more futile because of the giant swatting them away.It only took a few moments for Mina and Velin to wipe out the rangers. Once the last one fell, skewered by both an icicle and a golden feather, Velin cast a buff on Ouroboros while Mina threw a blizzard at Jorge and the struggling mage. With a soft hiss, the whole area around the dwarf surged with a deep chill. Jorge teleported away as the remaining mage froze solid, appearing behind one of the armored wolfkin and thrusting both of his daggers through gaps in its armor. With a gasp, the armored wolfkin stiffened and collapsed.Throwing a glare at Mina, Jorge was about to attack the other wolfkin, when Thorn stepped forward and grabbed the armored NPC from behind, lifting him completely off the ground and tossing him aside. The armored wolfkin hit the wall with a loud crack, his neck breaking. Once again silence descended, as Thorn stared at the now dead NPC. He had been excited to contribute but had not actually intended to kill the wolfkin. \"Holy...\" staring at Thorn's massive figure, Jorge backed up a couple steps as his words trailed off.Ouroboros, startled to see his opponent disappear, took a long look at Thorn, his mind working. After a moment of quiet, he stepped back and sheathed his sword. \"Alright, let's get all this cleaned up.\" After picking up the loot that had dropped, the five of them gathered around the door that the two mages had been working on opening. The door was a massive bronze affair covered in reliefs of battle scenes. Most of the door showed armies of wolfkin battling against fierce monsters and enemy armies. At the top of the door, however, a series of images showed a massive wolfkin, at least three times the size of all the others. Tracing the images from the edge of the door, different scenes showed the large wolfkin struggling through many trials before arriving at an altar. The image at the top of the door was of the bloodthirsty wolfkin accepting some sort of blessing from a powerful figure floating above the altar. \"Could that be Davyos?\" Thorn asked, looking at Velin, who was studying the carvings.\"Hmm. Possibly,\" Velin replied, tracing her fingers over the figure of the large wolfkin. \"We have no record of his race, so it has always been assumed that he was human. But it could be that he was one of these wolfkin. Many of these images do line up with the myths we have about him.\"See here? We have the young hero who leaves his village to go out into the world. Next, he joins an army and learns the cruelty of the world. Here we see him breaking out of a desperate situation and turning it around. This matches the story that he once led an army of a couple hundred to defeat an army of 10,000. Hmm. Ah, here he rises up in the ranks but is betrayed by his own people and is forced to flee with his supporters.\"That brings us to the center image, up at the top, where he is granted power. If this is Davyos in the images, then that is when he gets his triple category class and becomes a Devil Blood Berserker. Then, using that strength, he raises an army and returns to conquer those who betrayed him and drove him out of his home.\"\"Does that mean that there is a chance we will find that altar here?\" asked Jorge, his eyes lighting up as he gazed at the door. \"I mean, the one that Davyos used to gain his power.\"\"Unlikely,\" frowned Velin, dumping cold water on the group's excitement. \"If we look farther down the door, it looks like Davyos was forced to retreat again after he ruled for a while. See, this is him having to flee and dying while trying to escape.\"\"Are these a picture of the doors?\" Mina furrowed her brow as she pointed to one of the pictures on the bottom of the door.\"That is what it looks like. Who knows if this is a tomb or something like that. Regardless, we won't know what is behind the doors until we open them up,\" answered Ouroboros.Thorn sat down about ten feet from the door and began tossing apples in his mouth while Mina helped Velin examine the magical restrictions on the door. Inventory in Nova Terra was based on a player's strength, which meant that every player's inventory was different. However, strength was limited, and the more a player added to their inventory, the slower they moved. All of this culminated in Thorn having deep pockets, which allowed him to stock an enormous amount of food.As realistic as Nova Terra was, there was much about the game that Thorn still found astounding, and magic was at the top of that list. He had been in the game for a couple of months, at this point, and almost all of his time had been spent getting adjusted to the game. His unique situation had made the adjustment more difficult than that of the average person. Thorn's whole life had been an exercise in control. Controlling his strength, controlling his desires, his every activity was focused on making sure that his body did not collapse. This made his transition to the game rather time-consuming. After all, sixteen years of habits, intentionally cultivated habits, were hard to break. Despite his martial arts training, it took Thorn a long time to understand how to move. In fact, he was still figuring out how to apply his strength. All of this adjustment had left little time for exploring the fantasy aspect of this new world. Watching Mina and Velin examine the door was fascinating for Thorn. Velin would point, and Mina would draw a glowing rune with her wand. Every once in a while, they would huddle together and discuss things in hushed voices before going back to draw more runes. Seeing Thorn watching the girls, Jorge wandered over and plopped down next to him. Taking an apple, he gnawed on it for a bit before gesturing to the increasing number of runes on the door.\"Is this your first time seeing a magic lock? Pretty cool, huh?\"\"Yeah, it looks cool, even though I have no idea what is happening.\"\"Haha, don't worry. You're not the only one.\" Jorge took another bite. \"Magic is a whole different beast. It takes way more effort than it's worth, though, as you can see, it is quite powerful if you are able to handle it.\"\"I saw you use a pretty cool ability in the fight. Was that magic?\"\"Oh, you mean the shadow jump? I guess it is technically magic. But it's different from a mage or something like that. Mages use spells by working with runes and chants, while my ability is attached to my class. As a Shadow Assassin, I have some different abilities tied to the two classes. Some of them are innate magical spells, like my shadow jump.\"\"That sounds strong.\"\"It is. There is definitely an advantage to abilities that are based on magic, since they can bypass a lot of the laws of physics. However, it is important to remember that the game is balanced. While most people don't believe it, Eve does balance all the classes and adds restrictions to anything that is too strong.\"\"What about on people?\"\"What do you mean?\"\"I mean, does Eve balance people?\" asked Thorn, flexing his fingers. \"Wouldn't there be too many differences between people, if they were not restricted to a standard?\"\"Only insofar as the same rules apply to everyone. However, the advantages a person has in the real world carry over. Actually, there were tons of people complaining about it when Nova Terra first came out. Normal video games use the same baseline for everyone, right? Well, Nova Terra isn't a video game.\" Jorge smirked. \"Nova Terra is an alternate reality. Like people have advantages and disadvantages in real life, Nova Terra doesn't pretend that those differences don't exist.\"You and I are a great example of that. You must be huge in real life. I'm not this short, but I'm still way shorter than you. I'm so short that I got to choose between a bunch of different races that you didn't qualify for. Those races have advantages that you won't get and, actually, can't get. At the same time, being short has disadvantages that I can't naturally overcome. Like not being able to grab people by the head and throw them around.\"Remembering how he had killed the armored wolfkin, Thorn felt his face flush. He had not intended to kill him, but he had not quite gotten used to how his strength fluctuated. When the game judged his target to be friendly, it restricted his application of strength when he interacted with NPCs to make sure he did not injure them. However, when the system judged an NPC to be an enemy, it removed that restriction. Still puzzling over this, Thorn turned his attention back the magic users at the door.", "By the door, Mina was finishing up the last rune, and Thorn realized they were about to begin the opening spell. While it looked like the runes that Mina had drawn were scattered around the door, what happened next proved otherwise. Standing a few feet away, Mina lifted her hands, palms toward the door. Taking a deep breath, she began to spit out arcane words, each word causing one of the runes drawn on the door to light up.As they glowed, the runes started floating off of the door to gather in the air. As the different runes rotated in the air, glowing lines of energy raced to connect them, forming mysterious overlapping geometric shapes. To Thorn's untrained eye the symbols were incomprehensible, but he still found them fascinating. Mina finished igniting the last rune before to turning Velin, who was still standing to the side calculating something.\"Alright, we're ready.\"\"Okay. The first position is thetra, kal, emix, housan, rou,\" said Velin, looking up from her paper.Listening as Velin rattled off the arcane words, Mina swung her wand, rotating the runes to different positions in the air. Once the shapes had been moved to the proper position, she pointed to five runes in succession. The runes, each on different shapes, glowed brighter, forming a mysterious constellation in the air.\"Ready for the next set,\" said Mina with a deep breath, wiping away the sweat that was trickling down her cheek.Over the next two hours, Velin read out rune combinations, and Mina rotated the shapes to light up new constellations. It was tiring work, but halfway through, Velin cast a rejuvenation spell on the Ice Witch so she could keep working. Finally, they were done, and the runes began to flash. One by one the constellations they had marked out began to flash as the magical rune shapes spun on their own.Faster and faster, they pulsed in the air, until they began to blur together into a single complex rune. Jorge stepped behind Thorn as the girls made their way behind Ouroboros, who had readied his shield. At Thorn's questioning look, Mina looked grim.\"If we didn't get it completely right, it might be trapped. Even if we did get it right, it might be trapped. Plus we have no idea what is behind the door. I'd brace yourself,\" she explained.Thorn watched the door as the glow continued to brighten. When it was getting difficult to look at, there was an abrupt noise.*CRACK*Jumping, Thorn braced himself and waited for the coming explosion. And waited. And waited. Instead of a rushing force, what came were peals of laughter from Mina who had been watching Thorn.\"Haha, you jumped so high!\" Mina gasped in between her giggles. Seeing the rest of the party smirking, Thorn realized the Ice Witch had been playing a trick on him and blushed, rubbing his head in embarrassment.\"The one thing Mina was right about is that we don't know what is behind the door. Everyone fall in,\" commanded Ouroboros. \"Mina, watch for mana flux, Jorge get ready to jump.\"Squaring up, Thorn got his arbalest out and loaded a bolt while Ouroboros stepped next to the door and pushed. The unlocked metal door inched open, revealing beams of sunlight that streamed into the tunnel. Fully open, no threats were apparent, so the group walked forward, out of the tunnel and into the sunlight.As they left the tunnel, the land in front of them opened into a peaceful green valley. Sloping hills dotted with woods rolled between the sheer cliffs of the canyon walls that opened up before them. Widening to almost a mile across, the canyon walls were smooth and unbroken. The ground dipped down into a hollow in the center of the valley, a ruined city sprawled out in somber silence.\"Whoa,\" Mina exclaimed, gazing wide-eyed at the little world that stretched out before them.\"That must be Dayvos' final retreat. The place where he fled before he died,\" said Velin.Together, they walked toward the city, admiring the peace of the valley. Ancient stone buildings, spotted with age, rose from weed-eaten cobblestone streets as decaying wooden shutters creaked to and fro in the soft breeze. True to their expectations, they did not spot any more of the Wolfkin they had found in the tunnel.\"It's so quiet, though,\" Thorn said.\"It is quiet. The city has been abandoned for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.\"\"Can't have been,\" Thorn replied, shaking his head and pointing. \"Wooden shutters wouldn't last for more than ten to fifteen years, even if they had paint, which they don't. If the city was last occupied a thousand years ago, nature would have reclaimed it. Or at least overgrown it. The fact that we can still see most of the cobblestone means that the city was occupied more recently. I'd imagine that it hasn't been more than five or six years since people lived here.\"\"Hmmm. Why don't we spread out and look around?\" suggested Ouroboros. \"Give a shout if you find anything of interest.\"Agreeing to meet up at a large building in the center of the city, everyone scattered and began to explore. Thorn found a building with some large columns that looked interesting. A barely readable sign in an ancient language proclaimed its use, but Thorn couldn't read it. Based on the faded picture of what looked like a book, Thorn assumed it was a library of some sort and pushed open the hole-ridden doors.The doors were quite large, so he did not have to duck as he walked into the building. Looking around, he found himself in a large open hall with a desk set to one side. Large double doors beyond the desk revealed a massive room filled with shelves of moth-eaten books. Stairs in the middle of the back wall led up to a second-floor balcony that ran around the whole room, leaving the middle of the room open.Counting fifty bookshelves on the bottom floor and another twenty on the second story balcony, Thorn wandered over to a shelf and rapped on the wood. The wooden shelf still felt strong, a testament to how well sealed the library had been over the years. For the most part, the books seemed to be in pretty good shape, but every single book that Thorn pulled off of the shelf was written in the same ancient language that he had seen on the sign.Out of habit, Thorn tossed the book he had picked up into his inventory as he continued to browse. Along one wall, Thorn did find a large map and a rack of scrolls that he put in his inventory. The map was made of some sort of treated hide and showed many details of the surrounding area. Based on what Thorn could tell, it seemed to be the valley and the area north of Berum. A brief examination showed the location of the city of Berum, which reinforced Thorn's idea that this city had been occupied within the last ten years.Berum had been around for at least one hundred and fifty years, but the division of the city into four quadrants had only happened fourteen years ago when the current Castilian took over. Seeing that the map had the four quarters of the city marked out, Thorn could guarantee that it had been made within those fourteen years.'So why was it abandoned?' wondered Thorn to himself. 'The legends of Davyos go back thousands of years, and that ancient map that Velin scrounged up was that old. Or at least a couple of hundred years old. What could cause a whole city to be abandoned like this?'The fact that the books were still on the shelves and the map was still on the wall indicated that the city had been abandoned in a hurry without the time to pack everything up. Growing more and more curious, Thorn closed the doors and continued to explore the city. Wandering down a street, he peeked in a couple of the homes that lined it. Most of them were very similar in their layout but empty.In the distance, Thorn could hear the rest of the group moving around, but otherwise, the city had no sign of life. Over the next hour, as he poked around the buildings on his way to the center of the city, Thorn did not find anything as exciting as the library. He did find a street of what looked like potion shops, but apart from fancy glass tubing, there was nothing of particular interest.The center of the city was dominated by a hulking stone building set in an open courtyard almost a thousand feet across. The tall building towered over the rest of the buildings in the city that were two stories high, at most. Broad steps covered the front of the building, leading up to a wide landing with thick marble columns that stretched for the first two stories.Massive metal doors, that mirrored the doors that Velin and Mina had opened in the tunnel, were set in the thick stone walls. Looking around, Thorn could not see any windows or other openings on the massive building. There was a certain barbarity to the rough-hewn stone, and a close examination of the walls and stairs revealed thin red veins running through the grey stone. The building was quite different from the rest of the city, though Thorn had seen traces of this style in some of the other buildings he had passed by.It was almost as if the city had been built up around this massive edifice. However, without a reliable way to date all of the structures, Thorn could only assume that the large building predated the rest of the city. Hearing a whistle from behind him, Thorn looked back to see Jorge stroll out of an alleyway, gazing up at the big building in astonishment.\"Woooeee. That is one big building,\" Jorge scratched his chin as he stared at it, his eyes lighting up. \"I bet it's a dungeon.\"\"Dungeon?\"\"Man, you never disappoint, do you, noob?\" Shaking his head at Thorn's ignorance, the dwarf explained. \"Dungeons are specialized instances that can be entered over and over again to gain rewards.\"\"Yeah, obviously,\" Thorn rolled his eyes. \"Is there anything special about them?\"\"Haha, yeah. In this world, dungeons run a bit differently than in normal games. In most games, a dungeon resets every time you run it, which means the spawns, difficulty, and rewards are fixed. You get the same experience every time. Nova Terra is a bit different because nothing resets. Instead, dungeons in Nova Terra tend to evolve. For instance: let's say that there is an evil wizard at the bottom of this dungeon. Or top, since it is a tower.\"If we roll through the tower and whack the wizard, the next group of people who come through may find out that the wizard has become a lich. Or maybe they kill the lich and, the next run, it turns out that a group of priests have taken over the tower but have been corrupted by the residual evil magic. Or some such nonsense. Regardless, things in this game follow the same pattern as the world. Everything we do causes other things to happen, so what we do in a dungeon sets up the next dungeon.\"\"What if we destroyed the building?\" asked Thorn after pondering Jorge's words for a few minutes.\"I dunno. Nothing might happen. In that case, we would get a small amount of credit for 'razing' the dungeon, but anyone who found out would hate us. But maybe, after enough time had passed, an evil monster would take up residence in the ruins and a new dungeon would be formed. It all depends on what Eve wants to do.\"\"Huh, interesting.\"After a few minutes, the whole group gathered together on the steps of the huge building. Velin, who had arrived before Ouroboros and Mina, stood next to the large metal door scanning it for magic traps. After determining that the door was not locked or trapped, she called Ouroboros up and had him open the door.Thorn had volunteered, but the elven War Priestess had smiled and patted him on the arm. Despite his best efforts, the team seemed reluctant to let him help in any way, apart from being a porter, which made Thorn frustrated. Still, he was glad to be able to tag along with them, so he did not try to push his luck for fear they would not be comfortable letting him stay.Ouroboros made sure the others were in position before pulling the door open to reveal a blank, empty room.\"See, dungeon,\" said Jorge to Thorn, who was behind him. \"The first room of a dungeon is always empty. It's a staging room.\"As the group entered the building, Thorn heard the soft ding of a notification and looked down. \"Hati? Wait, I thought that Davyos got his power from Karrandaras, that archdevil guy,\" Mina said after reading the notification.\"That is what I thought, as well.\" Ouroboros furrowed his brow. \"Velin? Any thoughts?\"\"Give me a moment.\" Velin retrieved a small, leather-bound book from her inventory and flipped through it. After a couple minutes, she sighed and closed it, shaking her head. \"Too much information is missing. We know that the Devil Blood Berserker Davyos served as Karrandaras' avatar. Maybe he did so after being Hati the Moon Wolf's avatar? But I've never heard of Hati before, so there is no way to determine what happened. Most likely we'll find out more as we go through the dungeon.\"Nodding, Ouroboros commanded everyone to get into position, and they moved out of the staging room onto the first floor of the dungeon. Excited about his first venture into a dungeon, Thorn looked around with interest. What met Thorn's gaze could not have been simpler: a stone passageway stretched twenty feet to a stone room, light from torches placed four feet apart providing ample light.As they walked into the room, Jorge took to the front to check for traps. The first room was as simple as the hallway they had passed through, holding a small pedestal with a book opened on top of it. With no visible exit and no dangers apart from boredom, the group split up to look for the way forward. Thorn copied Ouroboros and Mina, who were knocking on the walls to see if there were any hidden doors. Meanwhile, Jorge checked out the pedestal while Velin looked at the book. Seeing that it was in a language that she had never seen before, she shrugged and put it away.Jorge found a switch and, with a grinding crunch, a section of the wall depressed and slid aside to reveal another hallway. However, as the group started to gather, four robed figures armed with bucklers and short spears with wide, leaf-shaped blades rushed out. With hoarse cries, they attacked.", "As always, the team's response was impeccable and instantaneous. One of the figures only made it two steps before collapsing as Jorge's figure appeared behind them in a silent explosion of shadow. Mina slid to the side on a sheet of ice that appeared beneath her feet, avoiding a stab, as she started to chant while Velin waved her staff, causing Ouroboros, who was charging forward, to light up. With a satisfying crunch, Ouroboros smashed his shield into the two robed figures in the front, sending them flying off their feet and into the stone wall.Rotating, the Holy Guardian roared out a challenge at the robed enemy chasing after Mina, who turned as if by magic and charged toward Ouroboros. 'That must be some sort of taunt,' thought Thorn as he watched the team taking their enemies apart. The rest of the fight took less than a minute, ending when Mina dropped the last enemy with an ice spike.Once the fight was over, Thorn stepped up, glad to finally have something to do. Walking up to the bodies, he crouched and pulled the dark robe off of one of the corpses, revealing a scarred wolfkin. Unlike the wolfkin they had killed in the tunnel before the valley, these wolfkin had dirty silver fur, stained with old blood and grime. Curious, Thorn looked at the others.\"Looks like some sort of cultist or acolyte,\" said Velin, walking over and prodding the corpse with the end of her staff. \"Look for some sort of religious symbol.\"Sure enough, after digging through the dead wolfkin's waist pouch, Thorn found a small token with cracks on it. The token was round, made of silver, and Thorn could see the silhouette of a howling wolf under the deep crack. Handing it to Velin to look at, he kept searching but did not find anything else.\"Interesting. I'm guessing that these wolfkin served Hati at one point. The symbol of the howling wolf against a round moon would match. But they must have fallen out of favor or betrayed the Moon Wolf, causing their tokens to crack. Hmm. We'll have to keep our eye out for more information. Info about a lost god could be valuable.\"\"Alright, let's keep rolling,\" Ouroboros said, taking the token from Velin to look at. \"This seems like it is shaping up to be a corrupted altar sort of dungeon, so we'll want to keep a heads up for possible ways to purify it. It is also getting increasingly likely we will be getting a solid class out of this, so we need to keep our heads in the game. We handled these guys pretty well, but if we are going up against ranged fighters or casters, we will need to adjust. Thorn, we're going to count on you to help deal with ranged threats with that massive crossbow of yours. Coordinate with Jorge so you are not doubling up on targets. Remember, no need to rush this, slow and steady keeps us alive.\"Hearing Ouroboros say that he could participate in the upcoming fights made Thorn so excited that he almost forgot to loot the other three corpses. Rifling through their belongings, Thorn tossed their whole pouch in his inventory and then stood back up, his arbalest out and ready, much to Mina's amusement.\"You know we are going to fight, and not eat, right, big guy?\" Mina poked him with her wand. Despite her teasing, Thorn checked over the parts of his weapon the way Janus had taught him. Once he was sure the firing mechanism was in working order, he stood at the back of the group and waited to proceed. Despite thinking to himself that he would do much better fighting on the front lines like Ouroboros, Thorn did not want to disrupt the group's normal way of doing things, so he tried to be as understanding as possible.The first floor of the dungeon turned out to be much the same, a series of rooms containing between two and six enemies, all armed with long daggers. Nothing out of the ordinary presented itself, and Jorge and Thorn's cooperation became better and better as they practiced. It even got to the point where they were able to take down groups of four enemies before the rest of the group could even engage.Jorge would always take the enemy to the farthest right, and Thorn would start with the enemy the farthest left. Once they were done, they would move in, toward the center. At first, Jorge assigned Thorn to one enemy, but Thorn's reload speed was fast enough that he could generally fire two shots before Jorge was done with his mobs.The only issue was the immense destructive potential of the bolts that Thorn's arbalest used. Unlike normal arrows that would stick into an enemy and make them bleed, these bolts either ripped their unfortunate victims apart or nailed them to the stone wall. The party had seen one of the bolts in action when Thorn had shot the armored wolfkin in the tunnel, but it was not until they saw the bolt stab six inches into the stone wall that they realized how fast it was actually going.The bolts would slam into the robed wolfkin, sending them flying back through the air like a kite with its string cut. After one bolt landed in a particularly unlucky wolfkin's shoulder and ripped his arm completely off, Mina could not take it anymore and made a gagging motion.\"Thorn, do you really have to break them into pieces like that?\" Mina complained.\"Ah, sorry. I was aiming for his chest, but he moved.\"\"Ug, so bloody. Why don't you let me deal with them from now on? I'll be able to do it much cleaner, and you won't waste ammo.\"\"It's okay, I have plenty of bolts. I still have almost 1200, actually.\"\"Are you serious?\" Velin cut in, her eyes moving between Thorn and the massive bolt that had nailed the poor wolfkin to the floor. \"The bolts weigh, what, 15 pounds?\"\"The shaft is nine pounds the metal head adds three and a half pounds,\" nodded Thorn.\"You are carrying 1200 twelve and a half pound bolts, in addition to all the stuff you are carrying for us?\"\"Yeah. Just under. This game's weight reduction is something, huh?\"Without replying, Velin looked at Ouroboros.\"Regardless, next time I'm going to attack. Your arrows are way too bloody,\" said Mina, getting out her wand and holding it up in front of her.\"Please, Thorn is much better than you at ranged combat. His bolts don't take up mana, he fires faster, and they are all one hit kills. Compared to that, your ice spikes are terrible,\" argued Jorge, ever ready to give the Ice Witch a hard time.As the three of them moved toward the next room, bickering as they went, Ouroboros and Velin stayed a bit farther back. Ouroboros' face was pale, his hands gripping the top of his shield as it rested on the ground. Velin's face was as grave as ever as she watched him. With a shake of his head, Ouroboros gave her a determined smile and picked up his shield, walking after the others.\"This is looking worse and worse,\" muttered Velin under her breath as she watched Ouroboros' back.After a couple more rooms, the hallway widened out, and a large metal door appeared. Even Thorn could tell that this was the boss room. Since this was a new dungeon, and they had no idea what to expect, Ouroboros decided to take a conservative approach, directing everyone to stand in a defensive formation. Mina and Velin stood in the center with Ouroboros in front and Jorge a few steps back and off to the side. Thorn, like always, towered over everyone in the back, his arbalest ready. 'Being tall sure is convenient for shooting over allies,' Thorn thought to himself as Ouroboros opened the door.Inside the boss room a large, robed wolfkin sat on a big throne, surrounded by seven of the smaller wolfkin in black robes they had been fighting on their way here. The larger wolfkin's robe was a deep green, and his clawed hand held a long, smooth staff with a cracked holy symbol on top of it. Bloodshot eyes stared from beneath the dark green cowl, and with a cackling laugh, he welcomed the party into the room.\"Muahaha, welcome.\" His voice was pitched higher than was comfortable, creating an eerie atmosphere. \"You have done well to make it here to the Fallen Moon Temple!\"*TWANG*Just as he finished his last word, Mina nudged Thorn, who accidentally pulled the trigger on his arbalest, sending a bolt whooshing past the large wolfkin, straight through the head of one the smaller wolfkin that surrounded him.\"Gaaah!\" screamed the green-robed wolfkin, jumping so high in his fright that he nearly tumbled off of his throne. Dropping his staff and waving both of his hands, a magical crimson shield sprang up in front of him as he looked nervously at the massive crossbow in Thorn's hands.\"Sorry. Sorry. I did not mean to interrupt.\" Thorn waved his hand at the large wolfkin. \"Please continue.\"\"Uh, yes. As I was saying. Uh...\" It took a moment for the green-robed wolfkin to get himself back under control. \"You have done well to make it to here, Fallen Temple Moon! I mean, Fallen Moon Temple!\"\"Do you need a moment?\"\"Ah, yes, thank you.\" Taking a deep breath, the large wolfkin clutched the throne's armrest, his other clawed hand resting on his chest. After a couple of deep breaths, he took up his staff again, rising from his chair. \"You have profaned this holy hall and must be punished for your insolence. I, Amis, will punish you!\" he screeched, seeming to have regained his composure.Stabbing his staff forward, he began to chant in a foreign tongue, threads of bloody light pouring from the corrupted holy symbol on its end. Each thread floated in the air for a second before being inhaled by the black-robed wolfkin that surrounded him. With roars, their bodies began to grow, ripping out of their robes until they were a head taller than the green-robed wolfkin.Seeing them change, Ouroboros lifted his shield and drew his sword, leveling it at the transformed wolfkin.\"Engage at will!\" More than happy to comply, Thorn leveled his crossbow again and pulled the trigger, sending a bolt flying into the chest of one of the enlarged wolfkin. In an amazing display of reaction, the large brute spun to the side as the bolt approached, causing it to slam into his right shoulder rather than his chest. With a deep roar of pain, the hulking wolfkin staggered back a couple steps before launching himself toward Thorn, murder in his eyes.\"Watch out, these guys are tough!\" shouted Velin, casting a buff on the whole group.\"Means it'll be more fun.\" replied Mina, throwing up an ice wall in the path of the oncoming wolfkin. \"Jorge, finish the wounded. Mina, get your DPS going. Heals on me. Thorn, try to occupy the caster.\" Ouroboros barked out commands. \"Come on!\" With his last roar, the six charging wolfkin paused before turning to rush toward him. Seeing that the wolfkin were heading after Ouroboros, Thorn loaded up another bolt and aimed at the green-robed wolfkin, who was jumping around and chanting. Despite aiming at the hopping wolfkin, Thorn's first shot missed by almost two feet. The bolt ripped through the air and hit the top of the throne, breaking it off with a crack.\"Ahhhhhh!\" screamed Amis, abandoning his chant and ducking in fear as he felt the shockwave of the bolt whooshing through the air. Hearing the crack of the stone moments after as the bolt smashed into the throne, Amis panicked. Screeching like his fur was on fire, Amis waved his hand, summoning his blood-red shield. He dashed behind the remains of the throne, crouching down to make himself a smaller target. Peeking out from behind the crumbling stone, Amis caught sight of Thorn leveling his arbalest, another bolt loaded. While Thorn and Amis were playing peekaboo around the ruins of the throne, Ouroboros was holding off the six hulking wolfkin. Like a turtle, when a Holy Guardian tightened up their defenses, they became nigh invulnerable. Despite the ferocious attacks from the raging wolfkin, Ouroboros stood as firm as a rock. While his armor was thick, it was his skillful use of his shield and sword that allowed him to block the incoming claws and daggers.Behind Ouroboros, Velin chanted, calling down healing energy on the Holy Guardian. Next to her, Mina shot ice spike after ice spike into the attackers. Focusing on the wolfkin that had been shot already, it only took Mina six shots to cause it to collapse to the ground, switching her attacks to another until it fell as well. As they fell, Jorge appeared next to them, slicing across their throats before disappearing back into the air. One by one the wolfkin attacking Ouroboros fell to Mina and Jorge's precision attacks until only one remained. Behind the throne, Amis was still cowering, doing his best not to reveal himself to Thorn, who had taken to demolishing the rest of the throne, one bolt at a time. When he finally mustered up the courage to look around the edge of the pile of stone, Amis saw the five players standing together, his minions collapsed all over the floor in pools of blood.\"How could you beat them?!\" he howled, his eyes turning red. His high pitched voice began to deepen as his arms and shoulders began to swell. \"Those were my servants, not yours! How could you kill them like that?!\" The green robe began to give way at the seams, bristles of fur popping out as it ripped. Madness consuming him, he strode forward, throwing down his the staff as massive claws grew from his fingers. Red mist poured into him with each step, his form rippling with muscle and savage fury. The closer he got to the group, the larger he grew, until he could almost see eye to eye with Thorn.\"I'll kill you! I'll flay your skin from your body and destroy you!\"\"Uh oh,\" said Jorge, backing up and readying his daggers.\"This looks like trouble.\" Mina lifted her wand.\"Don't let him take the initiative!\" commanded Ouroboros, and with a motion to the elf behind him, he dashed forward to intercept Amis. Seeing his signal, Velin chanted, bestowing a blessing on Ouroboros, increasing his armor.Thorn aimed and fired, but this time his bolt did not even slow the enraged wolfkin at all. With a solid thwack, the bolt landed on Amis' chest, but he did not seem to feel it as he bounded forward to meet Ouroboros' charge. Lashing out with a massive claw, Amis hit Ouroboros' shield, sending the Holy Guardian tumbling across the floor. Jorge appeared behind him but was forced to immediately dodge away as the wolfkin turned to slash at him with uncanny speed. There were now no defenders between the enraged Amis and the team's casters.", "At almost the same exact moment, a barrage of ice spikes slammed into Amis' head, shattering and sending shards of ice raining to the floor. The massive wolfkin snarled and glared at Mina, who had already begun her next cast. Next to her, Velin was chanting, as well, and something about it unsettled Amis. Holy energy was gathering at an alarming rate around her, and the gem atop her staff was beginning to pulse with power. Sensing the growing power, Amis instinctively knew that it would be dangerous if he allowed her to continue, but, before he could do anything about it, another bolt from Thorn's arbalest came ripping in.Like the first one, this bolt only infuriated Amis even more. Roaring with rage, he bounded toward the girls, bent on ripping them apart before that terrifying power could be unleashed! Speeding up her chant, Mina gestured with both hands, and a large wall of ice grew from the floor, obscuring the girls from the charging boss. Amis snarled and, lowering his shoulder, smashed right through it. Chunks of ice rained down around him as he sped up. The ice wall had not even managed to buy them a second, and Mina knew it would be pointless to summon anymore.Frustration flashed in her eyes as she saw Amis coming toward them like a freight train. He was too fast and too strong and had changed from a wimpy caster to an unstoppable juggernaut, too. Mind whirring, she ran through her options. Jorge's shadow jump was on cooldown, and Ouroboros' taunt wouldn't work on a boss. Velin was casting and couldn't be interrupted if they wanted to take the boss down.That left her CC, but Amis had blown through her ice wall like it was paper, and he was moving too fast for blizzard to be helpful. That only left Ice Explosion. \"I hate ice explosion,\" she thought, but that did not stop her from preparing the ability. As she was about to step forward and blow herself up to buy Velin time, a shadow fell over her, and a massive arm appeared in her vision.Amis could almost taste the sweet blood of the little Ice Witch in front of him. He would take his time and savor it before ripping apart the beautiful elf standing right behind her! Howling with excitement, he launched himself through the air. A black line entered his sight, and everything seemed to slow down to a crawl. Despite his power and speed, he did not seem to be able to move as the line grew bigger and bigger, revealing a massive fist the size of his head. He blinked, and then it hit him.With a sickening crunch, the fist landed on his jaw, smashing it into pieces. Amis was sent flying to the side, his head tilted at an impossible angle and his jaw hanging loose. Tumbling across the floor, he only stopped when he hit the stone wall hard enough to shake the whole building. It was almost three seconds before he could scramble to his feet, and when he did, he found himself once again facing the unified group. Ouroboros had retaken his spot in the front lines with Mina and Jorge flanking him. Velin was still chanting behind him, the ball of energy on the end of her staff growing stronger with each word. Behind all of them, Thorn had reloaded his arbalest and was taking aim.Confused as to what had happened, Amis shook his head to clear it, sending waves of pain through his head as his broken jaw shifted. In his enraged state, the wolfkin boss grew even more aggressive, brandishing his claws as he howled at the party. Seeing that Ouroboros was standing in front again, Amis sneered and charged forward to meet him.The last time they had clashed, the Holy Guardian had been sent flying, and Amis intended to repeat the performance! Ouroboros, on the other hand, was not quite as keen. As a Main Tank, the fall from earlier had bruised his ego as much as his body, and he was not about to let it happen again. Because of the angle, he had not seen how Mina and Velin had deflected the wolfkin boss but, regardless, he was determined to stop Amis this time.This time, instead of charging like he had done before, Ouroboros took two large steps forward and planted himself in Amis' way. Rather than tightening up his defenses as he had against the six enraged wolfkin earlier, he held himself at the ready, his shield up in front of him. Within seconds, the snarling visage of the boss filled his view, and a wicked looking claw swept in, smashing into his shield.As soon as he felt the impact, Ouroboros took two quick steps backward, his feet slamming into the ground to help displace some of the energy from the strike. At the same time, he let the power of the strike flow through him before tightening up his body and armor, dispersing the extra energy. Despite the floor being made of stone, small cracks radiated out from where his feet had landed, giving testament to how hard the blow had been.Gritting his teeth, Ouroboros shook his body to get rid of the lingering tension and smashed forward, bashing with his shield as he activated one of his skills. Caught off guard when the Holy Guardian did not fly away, Amis could only lift his arms to try and protect himself from the large shield. Despite being stronger than his opponent, he had been forced to stop, and so his momentum was at its lowest, resulting in Amis being sent reeling.Off balance, the wolfkin scrambled to get his feet back under him when a sharp pain lanced through his ankle. Looking down, he saw a serious-faced dwarf trying his best to cut through his Achilles tendon. Like the last time the dwarf had attacked him, as soon as Amis turned to deal with him, ice spikes began to fly toward him. The last time they had shattered off of his tough skin, but this time the blasted things were aimed at his already broken jaw.With a howl of rage, he lifted his hands to protect his fragile jaw while kicking out at the offending dwarf. Yet Ouroboros would not let him do what he wanted, and another shield bash flew in, keeping him off balance. At the same time, another annoying bolt shot in, this time landing deep in his side, under his ribs. Furious, Amis snapped the bolt in half and glared at the giant who was already loading another! A chill ran down his back, cutting through the burning rage clouding his mind. Amis' gaze snapped to the elven War Priestess, who had finished her long chant. With a single word, Velin stepped forward as the burning light on top of her staff condensed down into a single beam. Despite his wish to move out of the way of that deadly looking attack, Amis found his body would not respond the way he wished.Shooting out of the top of her staff, a white line appeared, connecting Velin with Amis and burning straight through his large, muscled chest. Thorn could feel the destructive energy radiating off of the beam of light from where he was standing and, once again, vowed to himself that he would not get on Velin's bad side.Dumbfounded, the boss could only stare down at the large hole in his chest where his heart used to be. Looking up, he tried to speak, but his broken jaw turned it into gibberish as he fell to the ground, dead.\"Whew.\" Mina breathed a sigh of relief as she collapsed to the ground, exhausted. \"That was so tense! Ouroboros, what happened? Why did you get knocked away?\"\"Yeah, what was up with that?\" Jorge chimed in.\"Hey, you have no room to talk,\" quibbled Mina, turning to stare at the dwarf who had appeared behind the boss' corpse. \"You didn't do a thing the whole fight.\"\"Alright, that is enough,\" said Ouroboros, his tone dark. \"We did not anticipate that change and were caught off guard.\"\"I'll say,\" Mina rolled her eyes.\"I said enough!\" Ouroboros glared at her, his tone brooking no argument. \"Velin, how are you doing? Do you need time to rest?\"\"Yes. It would be a good idea.\"\"Let's deal with the body and then rest for a bit. We'll pick back up in twenty minutes,\" Ouroboros said, planting his shield on the ground.Walking over to the body of the wolfkin, Thorn poked around to see if he could find anything of value. Another broken silver holy symbol appeared along with some gold and a couple potions. The only thing he found that was out of the ordinary was a piece of paper with what looked like a recipe on it. At least that is what he assumed it was. The paper was written in the same language that the wolfkin all used, so Thorn could only judge by the way the paper was formatted.Knowing Velin would be interested, he dropped it off with her and then, after a quick look around the room, sat down to eat some food. Jorge had found a small chest buried under the rubble that had once been a stone throne and was working on getting it open. Velin was resting while looking at the piece of paper Thorn had found, and Ouroboros was cleaning his sword and shield.\"Hey, thanks for saving me.\" Somewhat startled by the quiet voice, Thorn raised his head. Mina stood next to him, twisting her wand in her hands. \"If you hadn't knocked him away, he would have killed both me and Velin before Ouroboros could have gotten there.\"\"Of course,\" said Thorn with a smile. \"We're teammates, it's what I should do.\"\"Yeah,\" Mina gave a strained smile. \"Anyway, thanks.\"Watching the short Ice Witch walk away, Thorn was puzzled by the exchange but quickly threw it out of his mind and started thinking through the fight they had won. Up until this point, Ouroboros and his team had walked over every enemy they had encountered with considerable ease. In fact, Thorn had been beginning to doubt that they found the game difficult at all.With impeccable teamwork and powerful classes, the fights so far had been effortless. That had changed today when they met Amis. The beginning of the fight had gone as Thorn had expected, but once Amis changed into his hulking form, the whole situation had gone downhill fast. Caught off guard, Ouroboros had made the wrong call and charged forward to engage, resulting in the Holy Guardian being knocked out of the way, leaving Mina and Velin exposed.At least Velin had the presence of mind to start chanting her most powerful spell. If she had not, the fight would have dragged on for that much longer. Amis had been powerful in his hulk form, and none of the others had been able to get past his defenses to hurt him. With the exception of Thorn, of course. Staring down at his fist, Thorn could not help but shake his head. He still didn't completely understand how his strength worked in this game. His punch had not been that hard, rather he had thrown a warding strike, designed to throw the opponent off balance in order to stop their forward momentum.\"Oh wait, my logs.\" thought Thorn.Pulling up his combat logs, Thorn scrolled back through them. Combat logs were common to most adventure games, and kept track of all that happened during a fight, especially abilities used at crucial points. In Nova Terra's immersive environment Thorn had almost completely forgotten about them, but they were a useful source of information in a game that hid most abilities. Thorn soon found the point in his log where he had hit the charging wolfkin. Opening up a browser window, it did not take Thorn long to figure out what had happened. A crushing blow did damage that ignored all defenses and applied a knockback effect. Because Thorn's strength was much higher than Amis', his warding blow had sent the werewolf flying.After the twenty minutes had passed, the group got to their feet and gathered at the bottom of the stairs that led up to the next floor. From the size of the building, Velin had estimated that there were at least five floors, and they had made it through the first floor. Looking at Ouroboros' serious expression, it was obvious that he was not very happy with their performance so far. If it had not been for Thorn stepping in at a vital moment, the party might have wiped. Even if they did not all die, they would have lost the girls, at the very least, which made Ouroboros quite upset. For an elite team like theirs, it was embarrassing to think that they almost died by the hands (or claws, in this case) of the first boss in a dungeon. Taking a deep breath, Ouroboros gave out directions.\"Jorge, you are responsible for scouting, I'll tank, Velin is on healing and Mina will cover DPS. Keep to your roles unless I call a rotate. We don't know what sorts of enemies we'll face, but we should be fine if it is more wolfkin. However, if we hit undead or spirits, Mina and Velin will swap since holy damage will be more effective. I'll take point, and Jorge will watch our backs. Everyone have their enchants up? Remember to watch for ambushes. So far this dungeon has been pretty straightforward, but we don't want to let our guard down.\"Throwing a stiff smile toward Thorn, who was listening with interest, he continued. \"Thorn, you'll stay behind whoever is playing DPS to add ranged damage. This means you'll be behind Mina while we are going up against wolfkin and Velin if we run into any undead. If we meet with spirits, your bolts will not do anything because they are immune to damage from unenchanted weapons, so stay far enough away that you don't draw their attention. We are going to be speeding up to make sure we can push through in a timely manner using a system called Clean and Sweep for dealing with a room at the end of the fight. So, when you hear me say clean and sweep, you can get to picking up all the drops. Focus on high-value drops, as there will be limited time for picking stuff up.\"Nodding that he understood, Thorn followed the rest of them as they walked up the stairs to the second floor, which looked almost exactly like the first floor. Ouroboros called for them to stop while Jorge ranged ahead. Once he signaled that they were good to proceed, the group made its way farther in, Jorge advancing in the front in order to handle traps and lone guards.Their first major fight on the second floor came when Jorge spotted a patrol of six black-robed wolfkin who were on their way out of a room, walking straight down a long hall off the one the party was in. After reporting this back to Ouroboros, they picked a corner to launch their attack from and set up an ambush. Seeing the quick and disciplined action of the party, Thorn couldn't help but be impressed. Once the group got serious, they worked with incredible precision. Even Mina, far from her normal chatty self, seemed focused and serious.\u00a0", "Ouroboros crouched down at the corner while Jorge slipped into the shadows on the opposite side of the corridor, seeming to melt into thin air. Behind Ouroboros was Mina, who readied her damage spells, while Velin stepped back about twenty-five feet and got ready to heal whoever needed it. Thorn crouched down half way between Mina and Velin with his arbalest at the ready.Coming around the corner, the wolfkin never knew what hit them. As soon as the first two heads appeared, Mina let loose an ice spell, sending sharp shards of ice into them. Startled by the sudden assault, the rest of the wolfkin rushed around the corner to try and see who had cast the spell only to get pushed back by Ouroboros with his massive shield. This disoriented them enough that Jorge could jump from the shadows and begin cutting them down from behind while Velin cast a bulwark spell on Ouroboros. Within seconds all six of the monsters were bleeding out on the ground without being able to get off more than a yip.As soon as the last mob hit the floor, its head crushed by a shield bash, Ouroboros waved Mina and Thorn forward saying, \"Sweep and Clean, 30 seconds.\" Running forward, Thorn picked up all the fallen gear and the few coins that had fallen and watched in surprise as Jorge completely dismantled the six dead wolfkin in a whirlwind fashion. Before the 30 seconds were up, Thorn found himself holding the six hides that Jorge had recovered while Jorge was off again, scouting ahead. The efficiency of the group was staggering and proved to Thorn that he did have a long way to go to reach the level of these experienced players.As the group moved forward again, Mina smirked at Thorn. \"Haha, that look on your face is priceless. Now you know what it takes to be considered an elite player. Then again, we're pretty much the best, so don't expect other groups to match us,\" she said.\"No kidding. You guys have always worked well, but that was next level. I didn't even get to fire. How did you get so good?\"\"Haaa,\" Mina sighed, \"you don't want to know. Let me just say Ouroboros is a training demon. When we all started the game, he had us doing the most ridiculous things in order to get our teamwork down. Nova Terra gives hidden bonuses for how well you operate as a unit, so Ouroboros beat teamwork into us until we hit the point where it was instinctual. Plus, once you get used to the mob patterns, it isn't hard to come up with a good strategy.\"\"Mina!\" barked Ouroboros, glaring at the petite redhead.\"Eeep! Sorry, boss, my mouth's sealed,\" said Mina. \"Sorry, noob, can't give away our secrets.\"\"Oh, no problem,\" responded Thorn with a wave of his hand. \"I didn't mean to pry.\"After that, the group sped up, working their way through a few more patrols. Ouroboros began to push the group faster to the point that Thorn barely had time to toss the gear into his inventory before the next group of mobs was being taken down. They soon got to a large, open room where, Jorge reported, the second-floor boss and the main contingent of wolfkin were hanging out. Almost without waiting for Jorge to finish speaking, Ouroboros called out, \"Jorge, flank right, and focus healers. Velin on me, Mina go wild,\" and charged straight into the large room. He was moving so fast that the first couple of black-robed wolfkin to notice him were run over, getting crushed by his heavy metal boots. With a shout, he drew all attention to himself as Velin dropped a full set of buffs on him, making his shining armor and shield glow with holy light. Howling their surprise and anger, the large group of wolfkin drew their weapons and rushed forward, right into range for Mina to drop a metric ton of ice and snow on them.\"Avalanche!\" Mina yelled, and then, muttering an incantation under her breath, she disappeared in a flash and reappeared behind two wolfkin struggling to dig themselves out of the waist-high snow that had been dumped on them, shoving two giant icicles through the back of their necks. With a gleeful laugh, she disappeared again, only to appear somewhere else to finish off another helpless wolfkin with her ice spikes.In the back of the cave, an old wolfkin wielding a skull-topped cane screeched his displeasure and raised his cane toward Mina. Opening his mouth to bark out his chant, nothing emerged except for a wet gurgle and, in astonishment, he looked down to find frothing blood leaking from a neat hole in his windpipe and Jorge shoving a stiletto into his kidney.After his initial rush forward, Ouroboros gave a loud shout and smashed his shield into the ground, where it stood upright. Transitioning his sword into a two-handed grip, he sprang forward, cutting down wolfkin left and right as if they were nothing but wisps of mist. Behind him, Velin stepped forward to the shield, almost as if she was stepping up to a pulpit, and began to speak arcane words. Powerful waves of energy rolled forth from her tongue as she preached victory for her friends and doom for their enemies.In short, it was an utter slaughter as the four experienced adventurers rolled over the horde of wolfkin like a tidal wave. It was nothing like the fight on the first floor. Seeing a high skill party in action was an absolute treat, as far as Thorn was concerned, but it also highlighted the skill gap between him and them. Once they were serious, the gap became a canyon. Noticing that the wolfkin were all but dead, he sprang into action, gathering all the fallen loot and arranging the bodies so that Jorge could skin them.After killing the last mob with a backhand swing, Ouroboros came back to where Thorn was and said, \"Thorn, there is a slight change of plans. We are actually making better time than I thought we were going to, so I'd like to push into the third level right away. How are you doing on weight?\"\"I'm fine.\" Thorn looked over his inventory. \"I'm actually pretty empty, since most of what I've been picking up stacks.\"\"Awesome. You good for continuing?\" \"Yup.\"\"Anyone else need a rest? Great, let's sweep and clean and get moving, folks.\" Sheathing his sword, Ouroboros walked toward the back wall and began to fiddle with some levers, soon revealing a dark staircase going up. Once they had looted the room, the group headed up to the third level, Jorge creeping ahead of the group to make sure the way was clear.As the soft glow of Valen's magical light revealed the cracked rock walls covered in lichen, Thorn couldn't help but grin. The thrill of adventure made him happy to no end and getting to experience this was beyond a dream come true.Once they made it to the top of the stairs, the party stopped and reorganized. Once again, Jorge disappeared down the hallway, only to come running back.\"Five skeleton warriors and two archers patrolling up ahead.\"\"Okay, swap up.\" Hearing that their enemies had changed, the group reorganized with Ouroboros taking point, Velin standing behind him, Mina and Thorn in the middle, and, finally, Jorge taking up the rear. As everyone prepped, Mina began to weave a strange spell, dark mist curling up from the floor. Taking out a small knife, she cut the tip of each of her fingers on her left hand and pressed a bleeding finger to each party member's forehead, having to jump to try and mark Thorn.A faint, dark blue line attached to each of them, linking the whole group together in a web with Mina at the center. Seeing Thorn's interested look, she giggled. \"I'm a Witch, not a Priest, so I don't heal. Since I only have self-heals, I use the power of sacrifice to move damage from one of you to me and then heal myself. That way you can continue to fight.\"\"Doesn't that hurt?\"\"Meh, it's not bad. More of a tingle.\"\"Alright, let's get moving,\" Ouroboros cut in. Once he saw that everyone was ready, he led the way down the hall, toward the skeleton patrol. Like the fights on the second floor, this one was over before Thorn could get involved. As soon as he saw the skeletons, Ouroboros charged toward them, knocking them back against the stone wall as he shoved his way into the center of the group. At the same time, Velin chanted a spell, pointing at Ouroboros' armored back. A dense holy light fell on the Holy Guardian and radiance spilled from him in a ring, destroying the skeletons as soon as it touched them.Within seconds, the skeleton patrol fell apart, unable to withstand the powerful holy energy radiating from Ouroboros. Behind the patrol, there was a large door and, opening it, they stepped into an old tomb that looked like it had not been opened for years. Dusty statues graced each side of a wide hall, and large cobwebs covered everything. As soon as the group was within the hall, the door slammed shut with a boom that sent dust flying into the air. Out of the darkness glowing red eyes appeared one after another, and a slow shuffling sound brought them closer. Dark forms soon became visible as a horde of bone figures closed in on the group. Ouroboros slung his shield across his back and tightened up his grip on his sword. \"Anytime you're ready, Velin.\"Without a word, Velin reached out a hand to touch the knight and, with a low chant, began to imbue him with a holy blessing. As the light grew, so too did the volume of the chant until it rolled thunderously around the chamber. Reaching a crashing crescendo, Velin spat out the last word of the chant.She immediately began to chant again while Ouroboros dashed out toward the waiting horde, his great blade swinging in a magnificent arc, crushing bones like twigs.Two slashes brought him deep into the center of the skeleton horde. As his second swing ended, Velin finished her second chant and pointed her finger at him, calling out \"Burst!\" in a loud voice. A pulse of light blasted out from Ouroboros, obliterating all of the skeletons around him in a spectacular fashion. The rest of the skeletons were cleaned up and, after looting everything, the group moved forward. The tomb didn't seem to present any major challenge to the team, and they got deeper and deeper into the catacombs. Finally, they reached another large door, and Ouroboros stopped the group.\"Alright, I am guessing the boss is through here. We've done well so far and lucked out that there was no ambush, but that's no reason to let our guard down. Thorn, you've been a big help in keeping us moving, so thank you. A couple things to pay attention to. First, this floor has not been very challenging at all, so it is likely that all the difficulty is at the boss. Second, it is a bit strange that we are running into undead. I know I mentioned that we might, but that was a guess based on the way the wolfkin are dressed and the fact that it might be a corrupted temple.\"If this is actually where Davyos betrayed his god and got the power of the Devil Blood Berserker, then it is likely that the final boss we are going to fight will be Karrandaras, the Betrayer. He is an archdevil and is pretty powerful. Good news is that it is very hard for an archdevil to actually manifest itself in this world, so it will not be a direct fight. \"Like all archdevils, his M.O. is going to be based on a competition of power and benefits, so we may be able to get away without a fight at all. Remember that the goal is to get classes, so we may need to cut a deal with him.\"\"Can we trust an archdevil?\" Thorn asked.\"Sort of. You can trust them to be true to their nature, which is to squeeze every possible benefit they can from you. But devils tend to be on the lawful side, even if it is lawful evil,\" Velin replied.\"Okay, everyone ready?\" Ouroboros asked. Once everyone nodded, he pushed open the door.The room they walked into looked like a large cathedral, with giant stone pillars, stretching to the ceiling, running up each side of the room. The stone tile floor was open, except for a small platform with an altar. Approaching the altar, the group spread out, walking cautiously and looking for traps.Finally, they stood in front of the altar, which seemed to be made out of a dark, rust-colored stone. Asking for the silver religious symbol that the last boss had dropped from Thorn, Ouroboros knelt and fit it into a depression on the front of the altar, jumping backward as the altar flared with a malevolent light. Swirling crimson lights burst from the dark wood, gathering into a strange, bloody-looking spirit.[WHO HASS COME HERE?!] boomed the spirit, its voice sending chills down Thorn's spine.\"I am Ouroboros, and I have journeyed far to find you,\" replied the Holy Guardian, his tone calm, considering the terrifying aura the spirit emitted.[HAVE YOU!? AND WHAT ISS IT THAT YOU SSEEK, OUROBOROSS!?]\"Power. Power of the Blood.\"[AHHAHAHA!] cackled the spirit. [VERY WELL, MORTAL! LET USS SSEE IF YOU ARE WORTHY!]", "Even before its voice faded, dozens of crimson lights flew from its body and splashed onto the floor, rising up as smaller versions of itself. Seeing them coming, everyone tightened their grip on their weapons and got ready for the fight. Without hesitation, Ouroboros dashed forward and slammed his shield and sword together, roaring out a challenge that drew the spirits' attention. Jorge blurred through the air, targeting one of the spirits at the back while Velin began buffing Ouroboros, and Mina began sending shards of ice at the approaching spirits. Behind them, Thorn leveled his arbalest but, after seeing his bolt pass through one of the red spirits without doing any damage, he could only accept his inability to help in this fight. Instead, he paid close attention to the way Ouroboros and the others dealt with their enemies. As Ouroboros had explained, against spirit enemies normal weapons did no damage. As he watched, Thorn vowed to get an enchanted weapon as soon as possible.At first, it seemed like the battle was going to end quickly, but, as Jorge stabbed his enchanted dagger into the last of the spirits, the altar once again exploded with crimson flame, and a wave of bloody energy spread throughout the room, collecting into a terrifying figure in front of the party.[KNEEL MORTALSS AND I SSHALL MAKE YOUR DEATHSS PAINLESSS!] roared the horned devil.\"Not likely,\" spat Ouroboros, slamming his shield into the ground. \"Same plan as usual, folks.\"Two hands grasping his sword, Ouroboros charged out as Velin stepped up to the shield. Behind her, Mina was getting ready to unleash her deadly ice spells, and Jorge had already disappeared. As holy light once again enveloped Ouroboros, he began to engage the devil in a deadly dance.Spinning and slicing, Ouroboros seemed to slip past every strike of the devil's claws, returning long cuts that began to bleed thick, steaming blood. Bits of flesh and blood splashed to the ground after every strike, corroding the stone floor. Coordinating with the Holy Guardian, Jorge would appear and disappear, harassing the devil from the sides to keep him from bringing his full offensive power to bear on Ouroboros.With a roar, the devil lashed out, trying to create some space. Under his wild swings, Ouroboros was forced to give ground, taking two steps back. But, before the devil was able to make a move, a sheet of ice appeared under it, growing as it wrapped around the devil's feet, trapping it. As soon as it was stopped in place, ice spikes and thick crossbow bolts slammed into it.Roaring with rage, the devil covered its head and chest with its arms, trying its best to break the ice at its feet. Red flames began to lick around its body, and with a stomp, the ice melted away. As Ouroboros was about to charge forward to engage it again, the devil unfurled two large bat wings from its back and rose up into the air, heading for Mina.Seeing that it was coming over, Thorn shot another bolt at the flying devil only to see it dodge in mid-air. Brandishing its claws, it dove toward Mina, intent on destroying the Ice Witch. Before it arrived, Velin chanted out a phrase and swung down with her staff.In the air above the devil, a golden hammer of light materialized and swung down, bursting with a righteous aura. Smashing into the devil's back, the hammer let off a sizzling sound as it burned into the devil's skin. *BOOOM*With a force that shook the room, the devil crashed to the floor. Excited, Thorn was about to step forward and start pummelling the fallen devil, but Mina pulled on his arm, so he backed up with her. Seeing that Mina and Thorn were backing away, Ouroboros charged forward again, his sword cutting into the devil's side as it struggled to its feet. Corrosive blood splashed from its wounds, pitting the floor as it landed. With each slash, Ouroboros had to dodge as the splatters of blood began to corrode his armor. His sword, protected by holy energy, sizzled as it ripped into the devil's flesh. Behind the shield that he had planted earlier, Velin continued to chant, filling Ouroboros with power as he chipped away at the devil, who was struggling to get to his feet. [FOOLISSH MORTALSS! YOU CANNOT DEFEAT ME!]With a roar, the devil forced Ouroboros back, pulling a shield of flame from the air to block the ice spikes and crossbow bolts shooting toward him. Standing to his feet, he summoned a ball of flame in each hand, shooting them at Mina and Thorn as he spread his wings to fly up into the air.\"Mina, keep him grounded!\" Ouroboros shouted at the sight of the devil trying to take to the air again.\"On it!\" Gritting her teeth at the incoming fireballs, Mina lifted her wand to point at the devil, chanting an arcane spell. With a thunderous crack, large ice spears attached to chains broke out of the ground, stabbing into the devil's legs and wings. By the time the chant finished, the fireballs were too close to block, leaving Mina nothing to do but close her eyes in resignation. *BOOM*Hearing the explosion of the fireballs but feeling none of the pain that should go with it, Mina opened her eyes only to see Thorn's broad chest. At the last moment, Thorn had stepped in front of her, blocking the fireballs with this back. Thorn, seeming unharmed, was already loading up another bolt in his arbalest to shoot at the trapped devil.\"Weren't they hot?\" Mina asked, confused by Thorn's unchanged expression.\"Huh? Oh, yeah,\" Thorn glanced down at his back, where his armor was glowing. \"It stings quite a bit.\"\"Ah!\" Mina chanted, sending a frozen breeze wrapping around Thorn to help cool his scalding armor. \"Thanks,\" said Thorn with a smile, shooting at the devil.With the devil chained down, there was no way for him to dodge Thorn's bolts and Mina's ice spikes. The only thing he could do was try and block with a fire shield. Unfortunately for him, the fire shield could not eliminate the ice chains, but he could not drop the shield for fear of the team's projectiles, so the fight settled into an uneasy stalemate.\"Velin, how long do you need to end this?\" asked Ouroboros, resting for a moment, his eyes locked on the struggling devil.\"Two minutes. But he has to be still.\"\"That's too long. Let's deal with his wings first. Jorge, get that shield down!\"Standing up, the Holy Guardian lifted his sword in front of his face, murmuring a prayer. A glow began to build along the blade, sending rays of golden light shooting around the room. When he was done praying, Ouroboros dashed forward two steps and, with a powerful jump, launched himself into the air at the trapped devil.Snarling, the devil focused all his energy on his shield, sending the flames into a frenzy. From a thin shell, the raging flames grew into a thick burning layer, completely hiding the devil from view. As the shield grew stronger, Thorn stopped firing in frustration. His bolts were getting burnt up by the fire shield, so there was no point in continuing. Putting his arbalest down, he was about to charge forward and try to beat the devil to death when Mina grabbed his arm again.\"Stay back, this is an AoE attack!\" Mina shouted, lifting her wand again. In front of the sneering devil, Ouroboros was still flying through the air toward the fire shield. As he was about to hit it, Jorge appeared next to the shield, slashing out with the thick dagger in his left hand. With a loud cracking sound, a fissure ran through the shield in time for Ouroboros' sword to cut past it, cutting deep into the devil's shoulder.Ignoring the devil's roar of rage, Ouroboros grasped the hilt of his sword, channeling holy energy into the devil's body. In an instant, the energy overflowed from the sword, burning through the devil and everything around. Even the stone floor underfoot caught fire, melting into a puddle.Jorge, who had shadow jumped to safety behind Velin, wiped his forehead. He had been caught in that attack once and he never wanted to repeat the experience. Currently, the devil was undergoing the very experience that Jorge wanted to avoid, and his screams proved that Jorge's choice to move was the right one.Standing amid the burning holy light, Ouroboros experienced none of the pain the devil was experiencing; instead, the light seemed to heal him of his fatigue, boosting his strength and encasing him in a formless armor. With a shout, the Holy Guardian pulled his sword out and sent slash after slash at the devil, who was trying to back up.The holy energy had evaporated the ice chains holding the devil down, but despite being free, the devil lacked the energy to fly. His wings hung behind him, dragging on the ground. One of his arms was almost detached, and a giant gash ran from his shoulder into his chest, corrosive blood streaming down to join the melted stone on the floor.\"Mina!\" Ouroboros shouted, taking a large step back. Mina, already ready, completed the chant she had started before Jorge had broken the devil's fire shield. With a whoosh, a blast of freezing air whipped around on the struggling devil, almost instantly dropping the temperature surrounding him to almost sixty degrees below zero.The sudden change in temperature dealt massive damage to the devil, freezing its corrosive blood and locking its movement as the liquid stone froze around its feet, trapping it in place once again. Attack after attack rained down on the devil as the whole team started to go all out on offense. Even Thorn picked his arbalest and started firing again, sending bolts ripping through the air into the trapped devil.Within only a few moments, the crimson devil finally fell, and the team moved back into their original formation in front of the altar. Thorn was once again astounded at how efficient their teamwork was. From beginning to end, they took everything in stride, adjusting their roles and abilities as needed. He was daydreaming about one day being able to work that with them when a voice brought him out of it. \"Thorn, can you come up here, please?\" The spirit over the altar had begun to boil in a weird way, so Thorn hurried over to Ouroboros, who had called him over. Reformed in the center of the altar, the bloody spirit they had seen when they first entered the room appeared and once again began to laugh.[AHAHAHA! I TRULY UNDERESTIMATED YOU, MORTAL! BUT NO MATTER, YOU HAVE PASSSED MY TESST AND YOU ARE WELCOME TO THE REWARD! WHAT IS IT YOU WISSH FOR?!]With another gleeful laugh, the spirit waved its hand, and a giant magical circle appeared under the five adventurers who were still standing in front of it. At the same time, five crimson flames flew out from the spirit and burrowed into Thorn, Ouroboros, Velin, Mina, and Jorge. Wrapping around and through them, the burning flames formed chains that did not keep them from moving or burn them.\"You are Karrandaras, correct?\" asked Ouroboros, watching the blood spirit.[SSO YOU KNOW ME! THEN YOU SSHOULD KNOW MY MIGHT AND POWER!]\"And I know your character,\" stated Ouroboros. [AHAHAHA!] Karrandaras laughed, leering at Ouroboros as it swayed back and forth. [MANY HAVE CLAIMED TO KNOW ME, AND I HAVE FEASSTED ON THEIR SSOULSS! ENOUGH! WHAT ISS IT THAT YOU WISSH FROM ME?!]\"Knowledge and a boon.\" This time it was Velin who answered, her notebook in her hand. \"I want the knowledge, and he wants the boon.\"[KNOWLEDGE ISS A COSSTLY THING, ELF!] The spirit floated to face her. [WHAT YOU SSEEK MAY COSST MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD!]\"I am willing to trade a name,\" Velin flipped her notebook to an empty page, writing something down in an arcane script. \"Will this suffice?\"[AHAHAHAHA! YESS! YESS! IT WILL SSUFFICE!] Twirling in glee, Karrandaras motioned, and the page was ripped from the book, flying through the air. Opening its mouth, the spirit extended its long, prehensile tongue and snatched the note from the air. [AHAHAHAHA! DELICIOUSS! ASSK YOUR QUESSTION, ELF!]\"I wish to know where to find the seed of the world tree,\" Velin said, her eyes locked on the spirit's fluttering form.[VERY WELL, ELF! THE KNOWLEDGE ISS YOURSS!] With a flick of his finger, Karrandaras conjured a bright, bloody light the size of a marble, sending it flying at Velin, who caught it. Holding it against her forehead, she closed her eyes and concentrated. After a moment, her face paled, and she opened her eyes. Nodding at Ouroboros, she put the red marble away.[AND YOU?! WHAT BOON DO YOU WISSH FOR?!] the spirit asked, turning its burning eyes on Ouroboros.\"I want the power of the Devil Blood Berserker,\" stated Ouroboros.[YOUR WISSH IS GREAT, MORTAL! BUT EVERY BOON REQUIRESS GREAT SSACRIFICE! WHAT WILL YOU GIVE TO ACHIEVE YOUR DESSIRESS?!]For a moment, Ouroboros stopped still, not moving. He could sense Velin's intense stare and, beyond it, Thorn's interested gaze. Closing his eyes for a moment, Ouroboros steeled his resolve and, his face white and his jaw clenched, pointed at Thorn's massive figure.\"Him.\"", "As soon as Ouroboros' words reached him, Thorn felt a sharp pain in his spine, and his world turned a frozen white. Jorge had appeared behind him in an explosion of shadow, thrusting a dagger into Thorn's back. Because of his height, Jorge had to drop to the ground after his strike, leaving the dagger stuck in Thorn's back. At the same moment, Mina raised her trembling wand and chanted, causing a deluge of white to wrap around Thorn, freezing his movement.Caught by surprise, Thorn couldn't react at all, experiencing a stunned state for the first time. Unlike most games, where a stunned state meant that a player could see what was happening but could not take any actions, being stunned in Nova Terra actually changed the player's perception of time, speeding up how time passed for them.Velin, giving Ouroboros a long look, shook her head and walked to Thorn, who was standing stock still in his stunned state. Using the end of her staff, she began to draw arcane runes on the ground around Thorn, pausing to consult her book every so often. Off to the side stood Mina, clutching her wand, her eyes revealing her conflicted emotions. Beside her stood Jorge, not bickering with her for once. Seeing how torn she looked, he opened his mouth to say something but paused. After a moment of hesitation, he sighed and patted her on the shoulder, shaking his head.\"Mina, I need your help,\" Velin said, tucking a wisp of hair behind her ear. \"We need to do this quickly.\"\"But...\" Mina trailed off.\"Mina, we all agreed. I need you to stay focused, okay?\" The elf walked over and pulled her into a hug. \"I know you like him, I do too, but you need to stay focused on our goal, okay?\" While Velin was occupied with Mina, Ouroboros approached the spirit floating above the altar, who was watching with glee. [AND WHAT MAKESS YOU THINK THAT I WILL ALLOW THISS?!] Karrandaras asked Ouroboros, a wide grin on its face. [WHY SSHOULD I LET YOU PASSS THE COSST OFF?!]\"The manner in which he has been delivered. And the fact that he is classless.\" Ouroboros listed the reasons without a change in expression.[VERY WELL, MORTAL! YOU HAVE MADE ME QUITE PLEASED BY SUBMITTING A WORTHY SACRIFICE. I SSHALL GRANT YOU THE TRANSFER OF DESSTINY! LET USS HARVESST IT!] crowed the spirit in glee, watching Thorn's face for the pain it knew was coming. Still stunned from the dwarven rogue's stab, Thorn was unable to process what was happening until an unbelievable, stinging pain in his forehead jerked him from his thoughts. With a gasp, Thorn fell to his knees, unable to move from that position as torrents of pain poured into him from the mark that Mina had left on his head. The magical symbols that Velin had drawn around Thorn began to glow as she started a chant. Purple and black chains shot out of the symbols, anchoring themselves to Thorn's body, causing his blood to splatter. As Velin's chant continued, the chains began to pulse with arcane energy. Thorn could feel the chains drawing something from him but, no matter how he struggled, he could not move. Little by little, the feeling of loss grew in Thorn's chest.Collecting some of Thorn's blood that had splashed to the ground, Mina brought it over to Ouroboros and drew another rune on his forehead. Once she finished, she touched the symbol with her wand, and a gloomy aura poured out of the rune, connecting Thorn and Ouroboros. A twisting black energy shot from Thorn's forehead to Ouroboros'.As soon as the energy connected, the feeling of loss in Thorn's chest grew even stronger. Desperately struggling, nothing Thorn did helped him, and he began to feel empty, drained of energy.With a flash, the spirit disappeared from over the altar and appeared above Thorn, who was now writhing in agony as the chains pulsed with energy. Looking at the strange symbols lighting up on the floor and the arcane stream connecting Thorn and Ouroboros' heads, it began to cackle.[WHAT DEVIOUSS MINDS YOU HAVE!] the archdevil spit at Ouroboros, grinning. [YOUR WISH SSHALL BE GRANTED, CRUEL ONE! FOR THIS ISS A WORTHY SSACRIFICE! TO SSTRIP YOUR COMPANION OF ALL OF HISS POTENTIAL PLEASSESS ME! AHAHAHA! YOU HAVE DONE WELL!] And, with a flash, it split into four crimson lights that shot into the four adventurers in the middle of the room. The largest portion of light headed toward Ouroboros, who opened his arms and accepted it. As Thorn struggled on the floor, Ouroboros glowed with crimson light, his armor taking on a blood-red hue. Bloody symbols crawled their way up his chest and onto his neck, causing him to grit his teeth in pain. Once the symbols had burned their way into his skin, the glow faded, and he opened his eyes, revealing bloody pupils.[YOU HAVE PLEASSED ME, OUROBOROSS!] said Karrandaras, grinning at the former Holy Guardian. [NO LONGER ARE YOU A KNIGHT OF ORDER! YOU NOW SSERVE A HIGHER CALLING AND WILL LIVE FOR A GREATER PERPOSSE! RISSE, MY CHAMPION! RISSE, EXALTED DEVIL BLOOD BERSSERKER!]Thorn tried to gather his wits as the pain rushed through his body. Struggling barely to his knees, a sharp stabbing pain in his back put him right back on stomach and, looking up with horror, he took in Ouroboros' callous disregard, Jorge's cold eyes, Mina's nervous smile, and Velin's inscrutable expression. The four other players had gathered around him as he lay on the ground.\"It's no use, Thorn; you won't be able to get up until the knife comes out,\" said Jorge. \"So you might as well stop struggling.\"Eyes heavy with fury and pain, Thorn glared up at his betrayers, but, despite his efforts to move, his limbs would not respond. The pain would have been manageable if it were not for the incredible heartache that came with it. Why would they do this? How could they do this?\"I'm sure you are wondering why we would stab you in the back. I'm sure you feel betrayed,\" said Ouroboros, his soft baritone at odds with the utter coldness with which he spoke. \"But chalk it up as a lesson about Nova Terra. Everyone in this world has an agenda, a goal, and they will only befriend you if you help them to reach that goal.\" Stepping closer to Thorn, he squatted down and looked straight into his eyes. \"This is not a nice world.\"\"Knowledge in this game is power, and power is everything. Absolutely everything. Everyone is fighting for that power and will take the first opportunity they can to rip it from your corpse. Especially when you are weak and helpless. Understand that we have nothing personal against you. In fact, I can speak for all of us in saying that we have even enjoyed your company and the convenience you bring as a porter. \"However, it is not often that we come across someone with your combination of ignorance about the game and trust of others. Add that to your lack of class and you become an irresistible opportunity. I can see from your expression that you don't understand what is going on here.\" Ouroboros sighed and patted Thorn's shoulder, the sensation sending new waves of pain through Thorn's body.\"I am trading your Destiny points for a better class for myself. Every player comes into the game with the potential to change their future by choosing a new class. Each time you choose a new class, you use up some of that potential. The runes that you see around you are part of a specialized spell that uses your Destiny points to grant someone else the chance to change their fate through a class change. In this case, me.\"See, I have a dual category Ancient Inheritance class already that I spent two Destiny points to acquire. This means that, if I want a quad category Ancient Inheritance class, I am right out of luck. Even starting a fresh character will not help since this ridiculous game is based on your actual identity, and Destiny points do not refresh. Once a Destiny point is used to change your class, that's it, there is no going back. Besides, acquiring a quad category Ancient Inheritance class is a pipe dream because it requires four Destiny points, and everyone starts with three.\"The only way around that is if someone else is kind enough to use their potential up in your place and spend their Destiny points on your behalf. Sort of like what you are doing now. This way I can switch from my current class to being a Exalted Devil Blood Berserker despite the fact that I have no more personal potential for change.\"You are doing us a huge favor. While you will lose your chance to master a class, I will become one of the rare few quad class holders in the game. This will help me grow to be one of the strongest players in the world. Be glad that you can be part of creating the strongest player in Nova Terra. We are going to leave you here and will never see you again, so consider all of this a terrible, terrible dream. This is a lesson in the harshness of the world and the nature of people.\"Staring into Ouroboros' eyes, Thorn had no doubt that he meant every word he said. There wasn't a shred of mercy or compassion in those eyes, only the ruthlessness to trample on anything in his way. It made Thorn wonder if this is what it felt like to be one of the monsters the players killed. Why on earth would the game allow players to treat each other this way? His heart shaking with a mix of shock, pain, and adrenaline, Thorn could only rage at his impotence. There was nothing he could do to stop the group as they stood around talking about what they had gained.\"Oi, you were not joking about this archdevil being a strong backer, were you?\" said Jorge, looking over his status. \"Gained a title and everything. This is pretty powerful.\"Still looking at Thorn as if he was nothing more than an ant to be squashed, Ouroboros nodded. \"I told you. Plus, the title can be activated to increase damage after your blood has been spilled. I got the class, plus I can appoint twenty Blood Berserker guards. It's a dual category class that is the base for the Devil Blood Berserker. We earned a lot. Plus, there should be the possibility of growth.\"\"We can use the dual category classes to establish a faction,\" said Jorge. \"And with your quad category class, you will finally be able to compete with Sylith.\"\"Yeah. It will take me some time to get used to it, but this class is strong. The others will not be able to ignore us anymore. Well, we've got a ways to go, so let's get moving. Mina, we are counting on you.\" Mina walked up to Thorn, a strained smile on her face, and put her hands on either side of Thorn's head. \"It's nothing personal, Thorn. I'm sorry.\" Murmuring under her breath, freezing energy began to seep from her hands, and Thorn soon found it almost impossible to breathe as his thoughts got slower and slower. An almost warm feeling burst through Thorn's brain, and an immense sense of fatigue came over him, helping to dull the intense pain he was feeling. Somewhere in the back of his brain, Thorn realized that the warm feeling was the onset of hypothermia. Gritting his teeth and trying to fight off the fatigue, Thorn was helpless to stop his brain from getting colder and colder.\"Don't fight it, big guy, it will all be over in a moment,\" said Jorge, from the side, as Mina increased the amount of energy pouring out of her hands. Ice began to form around Thorn's head as he glared at her and, within another minute, he had faded into darkness. After Thorn had fallen unconscious, Mina, still smiling her silly smile, looked down at her trembling hands. The smile faded from her face as she fell to her knees, gasping for breath. Furrowing his brow, Ouroboros stepped closer to check on her, but she waved him away. \"I over-drew my mana. I'll be fine in a moment. The big guy was harder to take down than expected.\" Before he had died, Mina had seen a change in Thorn's eyes, so subtle that she had almost missed it. His shock had given way, and a different emotion had replaced it. Mina had seen rage before, but this was different, deep burning hurt that made shivers crawl down her spine, for some reason, causing her to stumble.\"How much health did that guy have? Wasn't the pain from the transfer supposed to knock him out? Not only did it not knock him out, but I half expected him to jump up and attack us,\" Jorge wondered aloud as he stared at Thorn's body, shocked. \"Plus, that backstab should have cut his health in half, at the very least, even before he got hit with the transfer. Sheesh.\" Shaking his head, he began to search Thorn's body.\"It doesn't matter. We're moving on and will never see him again anyway,\" replied Ouroboros, helping Mina to her feet. \"And if we do, we'll kill him again. Can you grab that ring?\"\"Nah, quest item,\" grunted Jorge as he stopped pulling on the ring that refused to come off of the corpse. \"Why didn't he drop anything? Where is his crossbow?\"\"I'm not sure, maybe he dropped it during the fight with the devil?\"\"Huh, doesn't seem to be over there. What kind of luck does he have to not drop a single thing? The odds of that are tiny. Anyway, what about all the loot on him? He is holding onto everything we have gotten today. We picked up a ton of loot from this dungeon, but he was carrying it.\"\"Leave him be,\" Ouroboros commanded. \"I had to kick him from the party so that you could stun him, which means he is no longer our porter. I can't withdraw the loot from his inventory. Karrandaras gave us the quad category class for sacrificing him and the dual category class change stones, we can leave everything else for him. Since we took something valuable from him, leaving the loot with him is the least we can do. The situation in the guild is far from stable, and we can finally do something about it. Our plan can be decided after we get on the road. There is a lot of catching up to do before we can compete with the top teams.\"\"These classes will give us a big boost,\" Velin said, a small frown creasing her face as she looked down at Thorn. \"But I feel like we made the wrong choice.\"\"Haha, what does it matter?\" replied Jorge, his voice cracking. \"We needed a noob as a fifth, and he was unlucky enough to be the one. And, as Ouroboros says, we're likely never going to see him again and, even if we do, what could he do to us? Haha, I bet he will quit the game after this, anyway.\"\"That's enough, Jorge,\" Ouroboros shushed the laughing dwarf. \"Velin, you know that, in this world, the weak are at the mercy of the strong. If he didn't want to be taken advantage of, he should have protected himself better. Anyone else in our position would have made the same choice. What is one person in the face of the greatest achievement this game has ever seen?\"\"And should I take that same perspective, Ouroboros?\" said Velin, eyebrows raised. \"Do I need to protect myself against you? Should I prepare myself to be sacrificed?\"Watching her take a small step away from him nettled the usually calm Ouroboros. \"Come on, Velin, you know I wouldn't do anything that could hurt you,\" the new Exalted Devil Blood Berserker said, stepping after the elf and grasping one of her hands. \"I know it was mean of us, but we all agreed to go down this path to the end, no matter how cruel.\"Silent, Velin pulled her hand away and walked out without looking at him. Walking after her, Mina couldn't help but wonder why her hands would not stop trembling.\u00a0", "For a normal character, being incapacitated like this would send them to the logout screen of Nova Terra, where they could open their pod and exit, but Thorn didn't have that luxury. His condition had warranted full immersion, and full immersion is what he had. Instead of the epic landscape of the loading page, Thorn found himself elsewhere, suspended in darkness. However, this darkness seemed more than a simple lack of light. Rather, it was darkness that was deeper. A smothering, consuming darkness. At first, Thorn assumed that there was nothing to see, but he realized that his other senses were muted as well, a perfect sensory deprivation experience.At first, Thorn's brain scrambled to make sense of this strange state, reaching out for some sort of input. With rising panic, he began to scream mentally as the pain and anger he had been subjected to threatened to overwhelm him. Struggling to control his overflowing feelings, Thorn calmed himself by narrowing his focus, like he had been taught.Reduce all extraneous thoughts, clear the mind, focus on a single point. Meditation had been part of his martial arts training, and it had worked wonders in helping him get through the pain caused by his condition. \"Pick a point and zero in.\" he repeated mentally, focusing his mind on the party that had betrayed him. His anger helped him throttle the panic that had surged up, and by focusing on the last scene he had witnessed before the darkness, he was able to settle his thoughts.Taking a deep mental breath, he relaxed. After an indeterminable amount of time, Thorn noticed a growing glow and realized that he was starting to be able to see. Faintly, he began to see a strange figure materialize in front of him. It looked blurry and warped, almost as if he was seeing it through a translucent wall. The strange figure looked like a cross between an angelfish and a squid with a tall, flat body and eight tentacles that spread from where its mouth would be. Thorn was curious about it but, for some reason, felt no fear or trepidation, despite its bizarre appearance.With an abrupt motion, the eight tentacles angled together, forming a point, and stabbed toward Thorn, pushing their way past the translucent barrier separating them. Squirming and pushing, the odd creature forced its appendages through the wall as it approached closer, its tentacles opening up and sliding around Thorn before pulling him back. With a pop, Thorn felt the sensation of being pulled through the wall, squeezing through the hole the squidfish had pierced in the barrier.Sensation returned in full force as Thorn found himself standing in the endless expanse where he had started the game. The squidfish, its task done, released him and, with a wave of its fins, drifted off into the digital distance. \"Ahem.\" Hearing the polite cough, Thorn turned his gaze away from the retreating squidfish and looked down, where he found the NPC who helped him register standing with a clipboard.\"Hello, Traveller, it is wonderful to see you again,\" said Myst, her eyes darting around Thorn's face as if searching for something. \"Please bear with me for a moment as I have a couple of questions for you. The first time a player dies, it can be something of a mental shock, so we like to take a moment to talk about their feelings on the subject. This serves to make sure that the experience does not negatively affect the player in the long term. But, before that, do you have any questions for me?\"\"Yeah, what was that place? And that creature?\" Thorn asked, looking in the direction the squidfish had gone. \"Will that happen every time I die?\"\"That is a great question, Traveller. To answer your last question first, no. Then, in order, the location you were in was NULL space, a portion of the game where nothing exists. In order to safeguard the players who encounter fatal bugs, the consciousness of the player is transferred to NULL space to protect it. Once the situation is stabilized, the player is brought back out of NULL space by an Angler, the program you saw now, and sent to respawn.\" Flipping over a couple of pages on her clipboard, Myst frowned. \"However, we have a slight issue.\"\"A slight issue?\" snapped Thorn, startled by the words 'fatal bug' that Myst had so casually thrown out.\"Yes, traveler. Our problem is that you are not dead, so we can't send you to respawn. In fact, it looks like your subconscious is refusing to accept death, which, apart from being inconceivable, is causing you to get stuck in our rebirth cycle.\"\"Inconceivable, why would it be inconceivable?\" muttered Thorn, scratching his head. \"Nova Terra is a game, there is no way I can actually die.\"\"Yes, well, your brain doesn't think so. Or rather, it shouldn't think so. The realism of Nova Terra is strong enough to convince your brain that death in-game is real, and the game can judge when your brain accepts death. This is also supplemented by the game pods, as each has a limited amount of processing power. When the processing power peaks, the brain is counted as overwhelmed, and in-game death occurs. In effect, the two ways for death to occur are: your brain acknowledging that you have died, or, your pod's processor hitting a threshold. However, I see that because of your special circumstances your pod has more processing power than others, an oversight that led to this occurrence.\"\"Huh, so I died?\" asked Thorn, unsure of where this was going.\"It isn't that simple,\" sighed Myst, looking much more human than when she had helped Thorn register at his first login. \"The situation, as it stands, is this. Your character is incapacitated and should have already suffered hypothermia and died due to your brain accepting death. However, your subconscious refuses to accept the situation, which keeps it alive,\" said Myst\"Normally, this situation would still result in you being logged off due to your pod's processor peaking, and you would only be able to log back in after your body died, and you passed the 12-hour death penalty delay. But, the condition which should have caused your brain to shut down by taking up all available processing power is only affecting the primary computer on your pod, leaving the secondary and tertiary computers running.\"Pausing for a breath, Myst shook her head. \"In effect, your avatar is shrugging off the effect of hypothermia because you genuinely don't believe that it would affect you, and the gaming hardware is keeping your body alive. This is an oversight on our part, and your firmware is being updated to prevent this from happening again.\"\"Wait, so I am dead?\" asked Thorn, confused.\"No, you are alive. We have pulled you from the game to install the update. Your avatar is still laying on the floor in the cavern,\" Myst replied before flipping back to the first page of her clipboard and staring at Thorn. \"Now, why don't we talk about what just happened. You were betrayed by a group of people, used for their own ends, and discarded. Tell me, how do you feel about that?\"The abrupt change in topic jolted Thorn out of his stupor. Too much had happened in the last few minutes for him to focus on the events prior to being thrown into NULL space but, with this question, everything came flooding back. He had been recruited into a group and had been tossed away like he was nothing, used and abused. His first experience with other players was an absolute disaster, and that made Thorn furious. But, even as he raged in his heart at the four traitors, something in the back of his mind couldn't help but wonder at the situation.Before coming into Nova Terra, Thorn had done a bit of research and was aware that the concept of morality embraced in the outside world had been tossed aside by some players. There were very few humans who could get rid of the moral constraints that society placed on them, and Nova Terra actually had a solid screening process to alert the authorities to psychotic behavior.In fact, the more he thought about it, the more puzzled Thorn was. Ouroboros had led his group into that dungeon for a specific reason and had both Velin and Mina ready to transfer his potential away to Ouroboros, which indicated they not only knew what to expect from the encounter with Karrandaras, but they were planning to strip his potential away the whole time. On top of that, Jorge very clearly indicated that they had expected to receive some sort of beneficial title from the archdevil that Thorn, being passively involved, had missed out on.Additionally, they had killed him, rather than letting him continue to suffer the pain of the sacrifice. Why not leave him there if they were going to backstab him? Despite the cause of his death being intentional, it had been a more humane way to kill him than hacking him up with a sword. Did it have something to do with the reward they were expecting? Questions swirled around Thorn's head as he tried to remember anything that would give him a clue.Thinking back, Thorn recalled that, in the \"lesson\" he had been given as he had knelt on the floor, Ouroboros had mentioned everyone having a goal. The way he said it made it sound like everyone in the game had the same goal. Thorn had started playing recently and wasn't aware of any secret goal that would put players in such brutal conflict with each other. Granted, there was much he didn't know about Nova Terra.Looking at Myst, who was still watching him, Thorn replied, \"I think I'm fine.\"\"Yeah?\" Myst didn't seem convinced. \"Player killing is common in Nova Terra due to the non-permanent nature of death, but the damage done to relationships is as real in-game as it is in the real world. It is to be expected that you would be experiencing mental turmoil over this situation.\" \"Am I okay?\" Thorn wondered. Strangely, he was. The burning anger from a moment ago had disappeared, flaring before being smothered by a cold line of reasoning that had emerged from the recesses of his mind. Did that mean he would not seek revenge? Well, that remained to be seen.However, before Thorn could continue this line of thought, soft light pulsed once, and Thorn's eyes opened a crack. The cold flagstones of the dungeon floor pressed into his face, contrasting with the burning pain that ran through his body.Opening his eyes to the dim, flickering torchlight of the dungeon, Thorn looked around with bleary eyes. With a grunt, he got a hand up and rolled over, marveling at how much easier it was without having to be worried about his skin ripping. Thorn gave a painful chuckle as the thought flashed through his mind. That chuckle turned into a cough, with pain continuing to wrack his body. A number of screens popped up, but he waved them to the side and dragged himself to his feet.Feeling the carvings under his hand, Thorn took a deep breath, focusing his mind as his sensei had taught him, using the pain to clear his mind. He pushed the pain to the side, accepting it as reality and forcing his body to relax, despite the spasms wracking his body. After a few moments, he carefully stood and made his way to the entrance of the room. About to limp out of the door, he remembered the altar with which the others had been interacting.Approaching it, Thorn stumbled over the uneven tiles, nearly crashing to the floor. Catching himself on the edge of the stone altar, he gritted his teeth and pushed himself back up. The stone altar was only four feet high, made of a dark, porous stone. Symbols carved into the top and sides depicted the moon in various phases, covered in scratches and chips. The top of the altar was lit by a ghostly red light, casting a bloody glow on Thorn's pale face. Seeing that the item Ouroboros had fit into the front of the altar was still there, he ran his fingers over it, jerking his hand back in surprise as the faint light intensified, and the large, red spirit boiled up from the top of the altar.Seeming puzzled, the archdevil swirled forward through the air, examining Thorn with interest before commenting, [CURIOUSS. YOU SSTILL LIVE? I HAD WONDERED WHY I WASS SSTILL TIED TO THISS PLACE!]\"Why is that?\" asked Thorn. \"Should I have died?\"Sinister laughter echoed around the chamber at his question. Shivering with excitement, the spirit moved forward, twining itself around Thorn's body and running the back of its hand across his cheek. [YESS. YOU SSHOULD HAVE DIED. ASS THE SSACRIFICE OF BLOOD, YOUR SSPIRIT SSHOULD BE MINE!] The spirit stared at Thorn's body, examining his features. [YET HERE YOU SSTAND, DESSPITE THEIR TREACHERY, DESSPITE YOUR SSUFFERING. YOU MUSST HAVE SSOMETHING DRIVING YOU TO BE ABLE TO SSTAND IN THESSE SSIRCUMSSTANCESS. TELL ME, WHAT ISS IT THAT DRIVESS YOU SSO?]Barely able to keep his feet due to the pain that still sent spasms through his body, Thorn was startled by the question. What did drive him? What was it that caused him to refuse death, despite the pain? Wouldn't it have been easier to give up and go with the flow, being reborn? Was it because he had spent his whole life in this sort of condition? A saying his aunt used to repeat to him when he was young and hurting sprang to his mind and flowed, unbidden from his lips.\"I am more than my pain, I am more than my body. My body bends to my will, not I to it.\"[AHAHAHA] laughed the specter, [WHAT A MARVELOUSS WILL! YOU HAVE BEEN FOUND WORTHY. YOUR BLOOD HASS BEEN GRANTED MY BLESSSING. I LOOK FORWARD TO SSEEING YOUR WRATH VISSITED ON YOUR ENEMIESS! YOU SSHALL BE MY CHAMPION, MY AVATAR! KILL YOUR BETRAYERS AND I WILL GRANT YOU POWERSS BEYOND YOUR COMPREHENSSION!]With a thunderclap, the specter turned into a deep red mass and burrowed into Thorn's chest, bringing with it a violent, rending pain that left Thorn, once again, gasping for breath. The burning pain soon spread through his body, raging like a torrent into his limbs. The red current flowed through his body, pushing up into his head, bringing with it a splitting headache.", "Thorn could feel the crimson tendrils of fury creeping up into his brain, driving their way into his head. Fighting back against the pain, Thorn gritted his teeth so hard he heard them creak. No matter how angry he was, no matter how much he wanted to get back at Ouroboros for sacrificing him to Karrandaras, Thorn had no desire to become a bloodthirsty monster like Gargish.\"I am more than my pain!\" he growled, pounding a fist into the ground so hard his knuckles split open and blood splattered across the ground.[WHY DO YOU FIGHT, MORTAL?! I WILL GIVE YOU THE POWER TO DESTROY THOSSE WHO BETRAYED YOU!]\"I am more than my body!\" Thorn spat between gasps as he steeled himself against the bloody power trying to force its way into his mind.[YOUR EFFORTSS ARE FUTILE, MORTAL! YOU HAVE BEEN SSACRIFICED TO ME AND YOU CANNOT ESSCAPE MY GIFTSS!]\"My body bends to my will!\" Thorn roared.As the crimson tendrils broke past his defenses and began to penetrate his mind, a loud buzzing burst forth from his bag, and the ancient inheritance token he had picked up from Gargish appeared in the air in front of him. With his failing strength, Thorn reached his hand out and grasped it in his large fist as a gravelly voice rumbled by his ear.\"Let the earth help you, little friend.\" An amber glow darted from Thorn's forehead, wrapping the silver token in a honey-colored light. With a bright pulse, the crack running down the token closed, revealing the unbroken wolf's head, howling in front of the moon.A cooling feeling burst from the token, like billowing waves of refreshing spring water. The cool power washed over him, extinguishing the burning blood power in his body. Terrified, the tendrils of crimson power tried to fight against the waves released by the token but were soon drowned, freeing Thorn from their grasp.[NO! NOO! NOOOO!] screamed the spirit, unwillingly. [HOW COULD YOU HAVE THAT POWER! HE SHOULD BE DEAD!]Bloody, Thorn could only stare as Karrandaras began to swell and grow larger. The archdevil's form condensed, huge amounts of red mist streaming out of the red-veined stone. Soon a massive clawed foot appeared, smashing down off of the altar onto the floor. With a roar, Karrandaras condensed more of his body, as if he was forcing his way through a barrier into the world.Completely drained and unable to move, Thorn wracked his brain for some way to stop the archdevil from manifesting himself. Already, the sheer pressure emitted by the archdevil's foot and calf was almost too much for him, causing black spots in his vision.As he was about to pass out, Thorn's eye caught a glint of silver from his palm. \"That's right. This is the ancestral inheritance! But it is also a symbol of Hati, the Moon Wolf. It is unbroken, which means it might be able to purify the altar, like Velin said. I need to get it to the altar.\"Taking a deep breath, Thorn called up all the reserves of power in his drained body and drew back his arm. Mustering everything he had, Thorn hurled the token forward, sending it blurring through the air at the altar. Furious, Karrandaras roared and forced a hand into being in front of the silver token, doing his utmost to catch it.With a tremendous ripping sound, the token smashed into the archdevil's powerful hand and broke straight through, leaving a scorched hole behind. Smashing into the altar, the coin buried itself in the stone with a loud crack.Instantly, the same silver power that had washed away Karrandaras' corrupting influence on Thorn burst forth in massive waves, washing away the red veins from the stones in the walls and floor. Howling, Karrandaras' hand and foot started to fragment, and his condensing form began to scatter.[MORTAL, YOU WILL PAY FOR THISS WITH YOUR LIFE!] screamed the archdevil, turning his burning gaze on Thorn. However, before he could make a move, a deep growl alerted him that something was not right. Behind him, darkness gathered onto the altar and swirled together into the form of a massive wolf.[YOU...YOU...YOU ARE DEAD!] stammered Karrandaras, his tone changing to fear.Not giving him time to react, the giant wolf lunged forward, burying its massive teeth in the archdevil's blurring figure. With a scream of pain, Karrandaras faded, his figure blowing away like ash in a breeze.Relieved, Thorn sat slumped on the stone floor. In his half-delirious state, he wondered if the red veins in the stones would be replaced by black veins. As his consciousness began to fade, he felt a warm breeze, and his muscles began to fill with energy. His mind cleared, and he found himself standing as if nothing had ever happened.Facing a big wolf.A really, really big wolf. In fact, somehow, its head took up his entire vision. Blinking, Thorn jumped to his feet only to realize that the stone floor he thought he was standing on was actually the rough nose of the giant wolf. Two massive silver eyes stared down at him, reflecting myriad thoughts and feelings. At times curious, at times cold and ruthless, at times warm and proud, the huge silver eyes seemed like giant moons rotating through their phases.[Welcome, child.] A deep, warm voice echoed in Thorn's head. Instinctively, Thorn knew that the voice belonged to the wolf god whose nose he was standing on. [You have done well in breaking the seal of the betrayer. By slaying Gargish and repairing my holy symbol through the aid of Terberus, the Earth King, you gained my eye. By cleansing my temple from the corruption of Karrandaras, the Betrayer, you have gained my favor.]\"Thank you, uh, god?\" Thorn did not know how he was supposed to refer to the wolf the size of the sky.[Haha, you may call me Hati, child. Or Great Wolf.]\"Thank you, Great Wolf.\" This time Thorn bowed, his hand on his chest in the warrior's salute that Janus and Dovon had taught him.[You have a powerful spirit, child. A spirit much stronger than most of the travelers we watch over.]\"We? Are there more gods than you?\"[Of course, there are more gods than me. While I am strong, I am not strong enough to care for everything in this great world. I rule over the night.]\"But I thought the gods were dead? Didn't they fall to the dragons at the end of the first era?\"[And who told you that child?] Hati chuckled, causing Thorn's body to shake. [The dragons were strong, for mortal beings, but they were no stronger than our avatars. No, we did not die, but we chose to step back from the world at the command of the High One to give the other species of the world the chance to flourish.]\"Is that why Karrandaras was able to take over your temple?\"[When I stepped back from the world, I left my avatar, Davyos, but as the years passed, the Betrayer corrupted his mind with dark whispers. Through an evil ritual, Davyos betrayed my favor, pledging himself to Karrandaras and turning his people against me. From then on, the corrupted wolfkin appeared in the world. Karrandaras gave them the power to assume human form, so they could mingle with the other races of the world while murdering and hunting their prey in secret. The beings you know as werewolves are corrupted wolfkin, remnants of Karrandaras' power in the world.]\"What about normal wolfkin? We fought some regular wolfkin in the tunnel leading to the temple. Are they corrupted as well?\"[No, child, those are remnants of my followers who still follow the old ways. They have hidden from the world and only appear to fight against the Betrayer's minions.]\"Oh.\" Thorn shifted. He had assumed that they had been enemies. \"Sorry about that. I hope we did not harm you by killing them.\"[Oh, child, I am a god. I do not need them to exist. Nothing apart from the High One can impact my existence. I am and will be. So long as this world exists, I will be here. The same is true for the other gods. Of course, I would rather you had not killed them, because I love all of my children, but it is not my place to question the will of the High One.]\"Who is this High One you keep talking about?\" asked Thorn, relieved that he was not about to be eaten for accidentally shooting Hati's believers.[That is not for you to know, child. It is sufficient for you to know that the High One is the beginning and end, and my master. Now, let us move on to more interesting business. I have watched you, and I am pleased. Therefore, I choose to grant you my essence. Henceforth, you shall be my presence on the world, my avatar. My fangs and claws will be by your side, my subjects will serve you, and my radiance will watch over you.]\"But didn't they steal my potential?\" Thorn asked, downcast. \"How can I be your avatar if I can't master a class?\"[Child, no one can take your potential from you. Your potential has not been taken, it has been compressed. This makes it much harder for you to unleash it, but by no means is it gone. Do not despair, though the journey may be harder, though the road you tread may be longer, it is still possible for you to reach the peak. What I grant you is not a class. Rather it is a different path, a path that requires much of you.]\"Being an avatar is not a class?\"[No, anyone might be an avatar. It means that the essence of a god resides within them and that they are qualified to speak on behalf of that god to the world.]\"That means I can get a class, right?\"[Yes, child. Though, due to your unfortunate experience, you will be required to walk the path of mastery one step at a time.]\"You mean I can only take a single category class at a time? Doesn't that mean no mastery bonuses?\"[In a way. The strength of mastery is dependent on how well suited you are to a class. Say, for example, if you were to become a tailor. Your body is not suited for fine needlework, so even if you mastered the class, your mastery would not be as strong as if you were to master smithing. The same is true for a multi-category class. Because multi-category classes come with other people's mastery, they will never be as strong as abilities from classes you mastered yourself.]\"That makes sense, I guess. So it's a quantity versus quality question. I mean, if I have a multi-category class, I can get one additional ability, but my abilities will not be as strong.\"[Precisely.]\"Do you have any recommendations for what sort of class I should try for?\" Thorn asked. \"You're a god, so you should be able to tell what I am good at, right?\"[You are correct, I can see what you would be best at. However, it is not my place to interfere with your future in that way. All I can say is that patience is the key to choosing the best class. Now, it is time for you to return. Let us begin.]Under Thorn's watchful gaze, the massive eyelids closed.As the light from Hati's silver eyes grew dimmer, Thorn could feel power flowing into his body. Unlike the aggressive, invasive power Karrandaras' had tried to force into him, this power was warm and comforting, growing and strengthening him. His skin took on a silver sheen, and his muscles tightened, growing even stronger than they were before.The silver light continued to stream toward him, wisp after wisp curling around his body until no more could force its way in. The extra energy began to gather around him, changing his equipment. His black armor glowed as the silver wisps remolded it.Claws grew from the fingers of his gauntlets, as sharp as razors. The curling silver mist landed on his chest plate, engraving silver motifs of the phases of the moon. Around his head, wisps of energy condensed into a wolf head helmet.Once the armor was formed, the rest of the silver energy condensed into ethereal forms of wolves and wolfkin, shifting and changing. Above his head, the phases of the moon formed. As Hati's eyes closed completely, and the world went dark, his deep, warm voice rang out in Thorn's mind.[Wake, my champion!]With a gasp, Thorn's eyes opened. He was back in the temple, slumped down on the floor in front of the altar. Vestiges of the multiple battles lay around him, and the broken altar was quiet. Tired beyond belief, Thorn struggled to keep his eyes open. Finally, he collapsed backward onto the cold stone floor.When he woke up a few hours later, the room had reverted to its original state, the black stone altar shining dully now that the red streaks were gone. There was no sign of Karrandaras or anyone else, and even the marks of the battles they had fought were gone. The only things letting him know that his experiences were not a dream were the absence of Mina, Velin, Jorge, and Ouroboros and the deluge of notifications flashing in the bottom of his screen.*Ding*  *Status* ", "A new field had opened up in his status. Thorn still had no class, but his abilities were now listed. If what Hati had said was correct, then Thorn would not be able to take a multi-category class, but he could still get a single category class and work on mastering it.Curious, he looked over his new combined title and the abilities it gave him.   All of the abilities that he had gained were powerful and still contained room to grow. Sitting on the stone floor of the temple, Thorn could not help but shake his head. The last 24 hours had been an absolute emotional rollercoaster, between having such high hopes for playing with Ouroboros and the others to being stabbed in the back and having his ability to take multi-category classes taken away. Then fighting against the corruption of Karrandaras and gaining the favor of Hati by purifying the altar.With so much to think about, Thorn knew that he was not going to be able to process it in a short amount of time, so he pushed it all out of his head and opened up his inventory, pulling out some food. Once his health had gone up a bit, he pushed himself to his feet and made his way out of the top floor of the temple. The monsters that they had killed on the way up had spawned again, though in fewer numbers. Thorn did not mind one bit.Feeling quite aggressive, he pulled out his Tetsubo and charged as soon as he saw the first group of skeletons, smashing them beyond recognition with a few swings. None of the bosses had reappeared, so Thorn bashed his way through the mobs without a pause. On the second and first floor, where the party had encountered the black-robed wolfkin, Thorn only found more skeletons, which suited him fine.The city lay as silent as before, but this time Thorn found himself able to read the signs, making it much easier to navigate. That reminded him of the book that he had tossed into his inventory, so he stopped, sitting on the steps of a house along the road, and pulled the book out.[Twelve Major Climates of the Angoril Continent]Flipping through it, Thorn made his way back to the library and started tossing books into his bottomless inventory. Rather than leave the books for the next people to come, Thorn figured he might as well take what he could. Not bothering to organize the books, Thorn swept the library clean within half an hour.After that, he decided to check out some of the other buildings and made his way back to the main square. The majority of the buildings in the city seemed to be homes but, after peeking in a couple of them, it was obvious that they had been cleaned out. The only buildings that might have anything worthwhile were the buildings that were still locked.It was a day later that Thorn finally struck the jackpot. A merchant shop off of the main square had yielded nothing of note until Thorn squeezed down into the basement and found a large safe door. Hidden behind a shelf of old empty jars, Thorn only discovered it by accident when, out of frustration, he kicked a lantern that had been lying on the ground. His kick sent the lantern rocketing through the air and into the side of the bookshelf, which collapsed with a thunderous sound, revealing the large metal door.Without a key, Thorn could only resort to brute force to open the safe, but he had plenty of that. The safe was set against the wall and, from what Thorn could see, the hinges were internal to prevent someone from cutting them off. That proved a barrier for Thorn until he remembered his Form of the Moon Wolf and summoned his claws.Almost immediately sharp, pointed claws grew from his fingers. He had tested the ability earlier, discovering that they worked whether he was wearing gauntlets or not. Sliding his claws into the bricks on either side of the safe, Thorn grabbed the edges of the door and pulled the whole thing out of the wall. After brushing off the crumbled brick, he pried the door open at the top corner and managed to stick his fingers inside.From there it was as simple as rolling the door back, opening the entire front of the large metal safe. Full of anticipation, Thorn peered inside and was not disappointed. Piles of glittering gold bars met his gaze, as well as a small tray of precious stones and three books written in Wolfkin.At first, Thorn was at a loss regarding the gold bars, but when he finally put one in his inventory, he noticed that it had been converted to gold coins. Each bar was worth 200 gold and, with 27 bars, Thorn felt as rich as a king. The precious stones were not quite as convenient, so Thorn could only plan on going to an appraiser when he got back to town. Once he had put the gems away, Thorn looked over the books.[The Complete Alchemist][101 Poisons and Their Applications][The Code of the Wolf]The first book looked to be a primer for becoming an alchemist while the second was filled with 101 different types of alchemical poisons. Not having much interest, Thorn tossed them into his inventory to deal with later. The last book, however, caught his attention.[The Code of the Wolf] was a book of law, laying out the rules of the wolfkin from the first era. In pristine condition from being locked away in a safe for so many years, Thorn enjoyed reading through it. According to the book, wolfkin society was divided into three different strata: the Lord, the Warrior, and the Worker. A complicated hierarchy existed between them with each having control over a part of society. As far as he could figure it out, the society was equal parts democracy, monarchy, and military state, depending on what part of society you belonged to.Putting the book away, Thorn decided to leave. It had been a couple of days, and he was confident that Ouroboros and the others had moved on by now. While part of him wanted to see them again so that he could crush them into the dirt, Thorn recognized that he was not a match for the team, so it would be better for him to avoid them if at all possible.Limping along with low health, Thorn made his way back toward town. Due to his wounds and running into a few kobold patrols, it took him almost the whole night to get back to town. His [Night Vision] ability worked like a charm, so he had no problem finding his way back in the dark.The sun had just risen when he made it back to the gates, where the guards greeted him with curious looks. Over the course of the night, his wounds had continued to heal, leaving him with a bit more than 50% of his health. Health recovered slowly, and only sleep or a blessing from the temple could restore him to 100%.Despite all he had been through, Thorn felt no need for sleep. He was puzzled at first but then remembered that time was passing in the game seven times faster than normal, which meant that he would only need to sleep once a week or so. He had experienced that before, but because of his natural clock, he had been going to bed each night anyway.Since it was morning, he hobbled his way into the town's Temple and made a donation of a silver, instantly feeling rejuvenated as the on-duty priest blessed him. As he was about to leave, one of the priests stopped him with a winning smile.\"Excuse me, traveler, I could not help but notice the air of piousness about you. I can tell that you are one who is devout. A true believer. Have you considered becoming a priest?\"Startled, Thorn looked at the notification that popped up. \"What is involved in becoming a priest?\" asked Thorn. One of his goals was to gain a class, so he figured that there was no harm in asking.\"For a simple donation of silver, I can grant you the status of a believer, and from there you have to go through a bit of training.\"\"Wait, you mean I have to buy the class?\"\"No, no, nothing so corporal. The silver is a testament to your faith, and once your faith has been proven, you gain the privilege of serving Mayordi.\"A bit more inquiry revealed that, for a larger donation, higher ranked classes were available, and with a large enough donation, he could even gain multi-category classes. Shocked at the mercenary nature of the priest, it wasn't until he was outside that he realized Mayordi was the God of Merchants.Having turned down the class change, Thorn reviewed his goals. He had come into this game a blank slate, his only goal to experience freedom and adventure. Well, so far he had plenty of both. Not only the freedom of making his own choices, doing what he wanted, when he wanted, but also the freedom of others making their own choices, most recently to his detriment. While it had sort of worked out for him in the end, the experience had been a sobering reminder that he was not the center of this world.As Xavier Lee, Thorn was, arguably, the center of the world. One of the richest people on earth, certainly the richest kid, with people to take care of his every need and to fulfill his every command. He had come to Nova Terra with the idea of escaping that gilded cage and had succeeded with flying colors.The difficult truth of it was, however, that escaping that cage meant leaving the protection of people who cared about him. Freedom and protection seemed to be mutually exclusive. His right to happiness went only as far as his ability to act. Once someone stronger or more powerful came along, he was tossed to the side after being used for their purposes.The adventure had been good, though. Rather painful, all things considered. Thorn was not averse to a bit of pain, provided that it allowed him to achieve his goals. But the question became, what next?Without question, Thorn wanted to gain a class and start working toward establishing himself in the world of Nova Terra. While he had made some connections, Thorn had spent most of his time following others around, trying to learn about the game. Considering his experiences over the last couple days, Thorn felt that he had learned more than enough and was ready to strike out on his own. A class would be instrumental in that.As far as classes went, Thorn had been putting a lot of thought into what sort of class he wanted to have. While his size, speed, and strength lent themselves to some sort of combat class, there was something about focusing so much on fighting that turned him off. Even if he chose a different category of class, his fighting ability would not evaporate. That left Utility, Support, Production, and Leadership classes as possibilities.Utility Classes were pretty much out, since they focused too much on combat for Thorn's liking, as was Production since Thorn had no desire to be chained to one location doing the same thing over and over. Support was an interesting idea to Thorn, but as he mulled over it, he rejected it for the simple fact that Supports worked best in parties, and he had no desire to play with others anymore.The only category of classes left was Leadership, which Thorn had never imagined himself moving toward. However, the more he thought about it, the more it seemed to make sense to him. His titles were focused that way, and the abilities tied to them gave bonuses when interacting with wolfkin. A Leadership class would suit him.Second, the new title that Thorn had received [Lord Greymane, the Moon Wolf] seemed to indicate that, in order for it to be realized, he had to take back Greymane Keep from the corrupted wolfkin. Thinking back on it, Thorn seemed to remember that Gargish was a corrupted wolfkin. Chances were Thorn would be fighting more werewolves soon. Having become the avatar of the Moon Wolf, Hati, Thorn seemed tied to the wolfkin species. He could only imagine that his future would be full of meetings with them.Apart from getting a class and exploring what was going on with Greymane Keep, Thorn was also interested in continuing his study under the trainers at the Training Hall. Dovon, Janus, Hamm, and Master Sun had helped him in getting used to this world, and Thorn believed that there was much more for him to learn. His power lent itself to fighting, and Thorn was very interested in seeing if he could incorporate his existing training with practical combat in Nova Terra.Sitting down on the steps to the temple, Thorn took a moment to breathe and organize his thoughts. Too much had happened in the last couple days, from being jumped by Gargish to meeting and being betrayed by Mina, Ouroboros, Velin, and Jorge. Despite the ups and downs, one thing was for sure. Thorn's adventures were only beginning.\u00a0", "\u00a0First, thank you all for your interest in reading more of the Nova Terra: Titan series. Now to business. I am in the process of finishing up Book #2 of the series (just into writing the final chapters this morning) and will immediately be starting on Book #3.As I'm sure all of you are aware, I have a Patreon page where I continue to release the Nova Terra series a chapter at a time as I write. Currently, I post 3 chapters a week on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Because of my workflow, I don't release books to the public until it has gone through a round or two of editing and I am comfortable with it. Due to that, I will not be releasing Book #2 on Wattpad until I am done releasing it on Patreon. That will give me time to incorporate the feedback from the community and to let them decide how things go. Case in point, this week they're helping to choose the ending for Book #2 and what Book #3 will be about.When I have finished posting it to Patreon I will begin releasing it here. I anticipate that I will begin releasing new chapters from Book #2 in May. I know that is a long time away, but I want to give you a story I am happy with. The Patreon community has been very generous and I've been able to contract with an artist to do some character art which I hope to be able to show around the time I begin posting.If you would like to have a hand in helping to craft Thorn's story in Nova Terra, I would love for you to join the community at http://www.patreon.com/SethRing. If you want to talk about anything else, feel free to send me a message or connect with me on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/SethRing.\u00a0\u00a0", "Despite the overcast sky, work in the quarry was dangerously hot. Wiping the trickling sweat from his face for the umpteenth time, Thorn felt the rough scrape of stubble on his cheek. Dirt, caked on his hands and covering his rough shirt, left streaks on his large face. Adjusting his grip on the sledgehammer, Thorn rechecked the large stone he had picked to crack open next. Hot to the touch, the stone he was splitting had a good chance of containing Fire Iron, the primary product of this quarry. Infused with fire energy from the magma flows underneath the quarry, Fire Iron was a bright orange ore found encased in sedimentary rocks. Highly sought after for its higher than average melting point, Fire Iron was used to create armor and weapons and make tools for trades involving high temperatures like forging and smithing. Because of the fire energy contained in the Fire Iron, mining it was a hot, arduous process and the only option was to set up open-air quarries to extract the ore. Still, very few miners had any interest in frying while working, so most of Angoril's Fire Iron came from mines that used convict labor.He had been here for four weeks already, smashing rocks for days on end, and still had three grueling weeks to go before his [Criminal] title would be removed. Splitting stones was a hard, tedious business that required a surprising amount of precision and patience. First, the stone had to be dug from the hillside and cleaned off to determine if it contained Fire Iron ore. The process for guessing if a stone had any was rough, at best, since most of the stones radiated heat after being pulled from the ground. Resting his hand on the stone for a couple minutes, Thorn tried to judge if it was still as hot as it had been when he first pulled it out of the hole he had been digging in the side of the hill. By pulling the stone from the earth and letting it sit for a couple minutes in the open air, Thorn had a rough idea whether it contained Fire Iron ore based on how hot it was. If it contained no ore, the stone would cool to the point that he could leave his hand on it indefinitely. On the other hand, if the stone started to burn his skin, then there was a good chance it contained the precious ore. Looking around covertly, Thorn did not see anyone paying attention to him so, holding the hammer like he was hitting the stone, he grabbed the stone with his other hand and squeezed it into gravel. For the first week he had been stuck in the quarry, he had used the hammer and chisel to carefully peel back layers of sedimentary rock one chip at a time, revealing the Fire Iron ore underneath. However, he soon learned that the sedimentary rock was not nearly as tough as the Fire Iron ore and that, with the correct amount of pressure, he could separate them much more quickly with a little squeeze from his massive hands.Of course, not everyone had the luxury of being an eight-foot-nine-inch giant with nearly endless strength, evidenced by the fact that the other prisoners gave him an extra wide berth. A bit of rubbing took the excess stone off of the Fire Iron ore, revealing a nice piece about the size of a fist. A normal fist of course, not one of Thorn's.Thorn tossed it into the basket where the rest of his spoils were and started digging for another stone. Within seconds, sweat was once again dripping from his face. Ignoring the droplets, Thorn settled into the rhythm of the work. This was the first time he had ever done any sort of heavy manual labor and, to his surprise, he found himself enjoying it immensely. There was something wonderful in the repetitive motion of digging through the earth, hunting for ore. Despite the fact that none of the features of Nova Terra that were designed to keep players comfortable were working, Thorn was having the time of his life. After his incredibly emotionally-intense interaction with Ouroboros and the rest of the group, the hard work was cathartic, washing away much of the stress and mental turmoil he felt.The days spent cracking open stones had largely blunted the edge of Thorn's anger. It was fairly monotonous work, which gave Thorn plenty of time to sort through his emotions regarding being forced into spending his Awakening points on someone else by people he thought were his friends. Combined with the silence brought about by his disabled messaging feature and the guards who discouraged interaction among the inmates, Thorn was starting to decompress.While his initial reaction was to be furious with the group, continued thought on the matter had left Thorn unable to maintain his anger. Truthfully, if Ouroboros had explained the situation, there was a good chance that Thorn would have helped him anyway, giving his Awakening points to help Ouroboros acquire the Exalted Devil Blood Berserker class. Plus, because the game did not enforce a specific morality, it was quite difficult to say that what they did to him was \"against the rules\". Obviously, it had happened, so on some level the game was vetting it.Truthfully, by the time two weeks had passed, Thorn had lost any desire to get back at them, helped a bit by the fact that he had taken out some of his anger on Jorge. They had done what they wanted to do, and he was going to do what he wanted to do. Freedom lay in accepting reality and making courageous choices despite the actions of others. Giving in to his anger and trying to hunt Ouroboros and the group down was admitting that they were able to control him and to dictate his actions. Frankly, Thorn had had quite enough of his actions being restricted by others and wasn't about to give himself over to the desire for revenge. Without question, what they had done had hurt Thorn deeply, but he could choose to bear that pain with dignity, not losing sight of the way his aunt Julia had raised him.Thorn had been raised to be a hero, but so far, he had not been doing a very good job of it. After entering this new world, he had gotten lost in the freedom of it, forgetting that the only thing that happened when one lost their boundaries was getting lost. It had taken a very painful experience to wake him up, but now that he had awoken, it was time to find his way back to his path. Plus, the loss of Awakening points was nothing compared to what he had gained. \"Status.\"Name: [Thorn]Race: [Titan]Health: [100%]Mana: [100%]Titles: [Battle Mad], [Wolfsbane], [Lord Greymane, the Moon Wolf], [Friend of the Earth], [Criminal]Conditions: [None]Abilities: [Wolf Lord's Howl], [Avatar of the Wolf], [Call the Pack], [Blessing of the Moon], [Presence  of the Wolf Lord]Despite the fact that his Criminal title had locked all of his abilities, Thorn still had five of them, even without a class. From what he understood, that was five more than most people. Having his Awakening points taken from him was terrible, but as a result, he had met Hati, the Moon Wolf, the god of the night, and become Hati's avatar. Frankly, the trade-off was enough to make even the best players terribly jealous. Looking at his status, Thorn struggled to resist the smug smile that tried to sneak onto his face. While he had to be very careful what kind of class he took since he would never be able to change it, he was starting way ahead of almost everyone else. Having faced a potentially fatal medical condition his whole life before entering Nova Terra, his experience in the game thus far had been beyond anything he had ever dreamed. While he did not know what the future held, Thorn was confident in facing it. And even if his status as the Avatar of the Moon Wolf could not solve the problem, he always had his strength to fall back on.The conversation with the Moon Wolf had broadened his vision of the game significantly, but Thorn was still unsure what he actually wanted to do. So far, he had been meeting his goal of living freely, but he was starting to wonder what the point was. His goal had been to continue adventuring with Ouroboros' party and eventually join the super guild Ragnarok, but that path was shot down after they decided to dump him for a class upgrade.Thankfully, his encounter with Jorge after he got back to Berum had given him plenty of time to think about what his new goals were. Over the last four weeks, a rough plan had emerged. The first order of business was to get out of prison, after which, Thorn decided he would pick up a class. Once he had a class, he was going to go complete the requirements tied to his [Lord Greymane, the Moon Wolf] title. According to the description of the title, he needed to clear a castle or something. It had been a while since he had been able to access the description since almost all of his player features were locked while he was in jail. He could still think about classes, however, and after a couple weeks of thinking it over, Thorn had settled on the sort of class he wanted. Of the five classes, Combat, Support, and Production were off the table while Utility classes were still too combat focused for Thorn's taste. He had excessive amounts of strength and no need for abilities to augment his already formidable martial arts. He had decided on a Leadership category class. With the title [Lord Greymane, the Moon Wolf], Thorn was pretty confident he could find a Leadership class that would fit with the direction his life seemed to be moving in Nova Terra. His [Presence of the Wolf Lord] ability was ideal for interacting with wolfkin, and from what Hati had said, there were still groups of wolfkin that were not corrupted. The rough shape of an idea had started to form in Thorn's head. While it still lacked definition, getting a Leadership category class was a must. As he was thinking about this, a loud bell pealed, signaling the end of the workday. With a satisfied sigh, Thorn shook the packed dirt off his shovel and picked up his hammer and chisels. At the end of the day each of the tools needed to be checked along with all the ore he had collected. Nearby, other prisoners were groaning under the weight of their ore bags as they slowly made their way toward the checkpoint at the end of the quarry. Running his eye over them, Thorn smiled. When he first arrived, the sound of the quitting bell was a difficult and dangerous time, as those who had not made their quota for the day would rush to take ore from those who had. Needless to say, Thorn had quickly put a stop to that. Now, each prisoner spent their day working hard to make their quota since there would be no chance to take someone else's hard work with Thorn around.Lining up to have their ore weighed, the convicts chatted quietly, looking forward to the evening meal and resting. At the back of the line, Thorn stood casually holding a sack four times the size of any of the others. The rate at which he unearthed ore was monstrous, so the guards had found him a larger sack to prevent him from having to make multiple trips each day.Seeing him towering over everyone else, one of the guards pointed him out to the guard beside him. \"That is the prisoner I was telling you about, the giant. Ever since he came, things have been really quiet. Practically don't need us anymore.\"\"He is huge.\" His companion could not stop staring.\"You think? Nice guy, though. Pretty quiet and really calm. Which is good, since we probably couldn't stop him if he wanted to walk out of here.\"\"Why is that?\"\"Haha, when he got here, a couple of the other prisoners thought that they would put him in his place, so they cornered him and tried to intimidate him. He just laughed and kicked them into a pile. Then he flipped one of the ore carts upside down and trapped them under it.\"\"One of those things?\" The guard pointed to the massive metal and wood carts perched on a rail line into which the convicts were emptying their bags.\"Yeah. It took ten guards to get it off of them when we finally found them the next morning. But other than that, he hasn't caused a stitch of trouble. Actually, he has been keeping everyone in line for us. Someone tried to pull one of the usual stunts that first night and swipe another person's ore, and the big guy smacked him so hard he couldn't walk right for two days.\"\"That is really awesome. What is the big guy in for?\"\"Umm, I'm not totally sure. I think he is in for assault.\"\"Assault? I thought you said he was really calm?\"\"Apparently he killed some traveler in a town north of here. You know how travelers are. Everyone expected him to be a terror when the transfer came in, but it turns out he volunteered to come work instead of sitting in a cell. And I'm glad he did. He's made things much easier on us. But he only has three weeks left, so the warden is starting to get worried. I'm sure the bad bunch will be right back to their tricks when he leaves. After all, they're going to be in here for a long time.\"\"What about sticky fingers the third?\" asked the guard, nodding toward a slight figure who had approached Thorn.\"Hah, he's got a week left. Seems he knew the big guy before he got sent in. Not friends or anything. He tried to lift something from the big guy's room and got thrown out a second story window. Cook over at the cafeteria was telling me he has been trying to butter up the big guy ever since he arrived. Probably needs help lifting something that is nailed down after they get out.\"", "\"Hey, Thorn, how was your day?\" Oblivious to the two guards talking about him, Thorn looked down at the slim figure of Oberlin Danihoff, III, the self proclaimed master swiper he had caught trying to lift his goods back in Berum. \"It was about the same as every day, Oberlin.\" Thorn's deep voice echoed through the quarry. Even without projecting, his voice was almost as big as he was. \"After all, we do the same thing every day.\"\"But each day is a fresh new chance, isn't it? At least, that is what people tell me.\" Oberlin flashed his trademark smile as he poked Thorn's large bag of ore. \"How'd you do? Looks like quite the haul today.\"\"It was not too bad. I hit a pocket before lunch and managed to clear most of it out before the bell.\" Seeing the guard motion him forward, Thorn upended his bag onto the table to be sorted. The guard gave each piece a cursory look before tossing it onto a scale where a clerk recorded the weight. Never once in the four weeks that Thorn had been mining here had he tried to sneak a piece of slag into his pile of rocks, so the guard focused more on speed than on rigorous checking. After all, the pile of ore Thorn had brought over was massive and the guard was just as excited to get to dinner as the convicts.After the clerk recorded the total weight, Thorn and Oberlin joined the rest of the convicts queued at the cafeteria. Like most of the buildings in the quarry prison, the cafeteria was largely comprised of open air seating and two small buildings where the food was cooked and served. As always, when Thorn arrived, the hum of conversation quieted, and everyone busied themselves with eating.\"You certainly make an impression.\" Still smiling, Oberlin looked around at the convicts eating quietly. \"So you've told me.\"\"Well, it never fails to astound me. This is one of the roughest crowds in Nova Terra, and they act like lambs around you.\" Oberlin paused for a moment, looking at Thorn sideways. \"Then again, one can imagine why they would behave like that.\"Dinner consisted of a big bowl of porridge, bread, a piece of fruit, and strips of meat. Because of the intense heat, the prisoners all drank massive quantities of water, and the cooks provided a sweet lemonade at each of the meals. \"Evening, Thorn.\" One of the cooks pulled out an extra large bowl from below the counter when it was Thorn's turn. Next to him, his assistant put two loaves of bread on a tray, along with four apples, and a small mountain of meat strips. Thorn's hands were large enough that he could balance the bowl and tray with one hand while he used the other to take a pitcher of lemonade from another assistant. \"Come back if you need more. We have plenty.\" Like most of the guards, the cooks loved Thorn. The gentle giant solved their problems with difficult prisoners simply by being around, and any convicts that tried to make trouble in line were quickly quelled when they felt his burning gaze. There was something about Thorn's hungry face that seemed to terrify the prisoners into submission, and for that reason alone, Thorn had quickly made himself a favorite of the staff in the prison. \"Thanks.\" With a smile, Thorn accepted the huge quantity of food and walked to his customary spot. Despite the outdoor eating area consisting of benches and tables, Thorn had learned very quickly that they were not made for someone his size. His first attempt to sit at one of the tables had tragic consequences for its bench.Instead, he sat at the far end of the cafeteria on a large stone that marked the boundary of the eating area. At least a stone would not collapse when he sat on it. Over time, the table closest to him had magically moved to a convenient spot within reach, so Thorn put his food down and waited for Oberlin to sit. \"Thank you for waiting.\" Oberlin joined Thorn, and they dug in. Wiping his mouth, Oberlin glanced around and then spoke in a low voice. \"Have you given any thought to what I talked to you about yesterday?\"\"Stealing is wrong, Oberlin.\" Thorn did not even look up from his meal.\"Look, I am not asking you to steal anything. I just need someone I trust to cover me when I go talk to the merchants. You don't understand how dangerous it can be. I'm telling you, Nova Terra has a dark side.\"\"I'm well aware of Nova Terra's dark side. But stealing is wrong, and so is selling stolen goods. Why don't you listen to what I told you before? You are a talented guy. Why waste your talents on stealing?\"\"Ha. Easy for you to say.\" Defeated by Thorn's calm but final tone, Oberlin's shoulders slumped. He had been trying for almost two weeks to convince Thorn to team up with him once they were both out. However, every time he broached the subject, he always got the same answer. \"What could I possibly do? My only skills are going unseen and opening locks. The only people I know are other crooks and fences. My class is locked and all my abilities only work for one thing. Believe me, I've tried. I'm on my last class, so there is no more changing.\"\"I don't think you ever mentioned what class you have.\" Thorn looked at the small thief with interest. \"I've been thinking about what class I want to get, but I haven't decided.\"\"What do you have now?\"\"I don't have a class.\"\"You don't have a class?!\" Oberlin nearly spat out his porridge as he turned to stare at Thorn. \"How did you get so big without a class? I thought you were a Mountain Barbarian or something?\"\"Nah, I'm just naturally tall.\"\"Somehow, I don't think eight feet, nine inches counts as 'naturally tall', Thorn. You must be a giant in real life as well. Why don't you have a class, though? You should be able to get one almost as soon as you come into the game. You can get them almost anywhere you can get training. There are general class quests practically littering the starter cities.\"\"I'm not sure. No one told me about them, so I don't think I ever found one.\" \"What do you mean, you never found them? You told me you trained at the Training Hall, right? Didn't you see the giant stone pillar with the warrior on it? You just have to go up and touch it.\"\"Oh, I thought that was a sign for the training hall.\" Thorn, blushed slightly. Thankfully, his face was dirty enough that Oberlin did not notice.\"The fact that you totally missed all the class change stones is almost impressive. At least it would be if it was not so ridiculous.\" Oberlin shook his head and licked his spoon clean before pointing toward himself. \"I have a special utility class called Master Locksmith. It gives me an ability that lets me bypass almost any lock and lets me know the best route for sneaking. It is useful for one thing and one thing only, which is why I ended up here.\"\"Interesting. I noticed that, when I got here, you were not chained up.\"\"Yup. There is not much of a point, so the guards don't worry about it. I've been in and out of this place so many times, you wouldn't believe it. Honestly, I'm not sure why they even bother bringing me in. It's not like they can stop me from getting out.\"\"Can you open magic locks? I saw someone break a magic lock once. Looked quite complicated.\"\"Any lock means any lock. Arcane, mechanical, puzzle, doesn't matter what it is. If someone has seen it and wants to get through it, I can open it. Some might take more time, but they all crack eventually.\"\"Classes are so interesting. Is Master Locksmith an Ancient Inheritance?\"\"No.\" Oberlin frowned and changed the subject. \"Look, Thorn, I appreciate what you are trying to do, but at this point, my options are set. I'm in a hole, and there is no way to get out, even if I wanted to.\"\"That isn't true. There are plenty of things you could do. You could be an explorer. With your stealth, you could map places no one has ever been before. You could be a security consultant. You know, get people to pay you to break into their place, and then tell them how it was done.\"About to continue listing ideas for the depressed thief, Thorn saw a clerk making his way. A few weeks ago, the clerks would not have dared to walk through the crowd of convicts without a full armed escort, but after Thorn had tossed a few of the convicts into the large pots of porridge in the cook house, they were able to walk about unmolested. Ignoring the dark looks he was getting, the clerk walked up to Thorn and handed him a form.\"You're out tomorrow, Thorn.\"Confused, Thorn looked at the paper. It had the warden's signature and looked very official.\"What do you mean he is out? Doesn't he still have three weeks?\" Oberlin cut in. \"How can he get out early?\"\"What does it matter to you?\" the clerk asked, annoyed at Oberlin sticking his nose in Thorn's business. Turning back to Thorn, he said, \"The warden would like to see you in thirty minutes. He'll be waiting for you in his office. No, no, you can finish your meal.\" Seeing that Thorn was about to get up, the clerk hurried to stop him. \"He is in no rush.\"As he ate, Thorn wracked his brain for possible reasons that the warden would let him out early. Officially, his crime was assault. Attacking another player in a town was considered taboo, and if the guards caught you, the penalty was seven real days in prison, which meant seven weeks in jail, if you spent that time logged, in due to the game's time dilation. A first time offense would have let Thorn sit in a relatively comfortable cell, but he had volunteered to come out and work for the experience. As an alternate reality, Nova Terra mimicked the real world in many ways, including there being a list of crimes that, if you were caught, could get you tossed in jail. Surprisingly, the sentence for killing another player was actually one of the lighter ones, at least for the first few times. Still, it was curious that he was being let out early. Maybe he was being let go for good behavior?After Thorn finished his food, he patted Oberlin on the shoulder, taking care to be extra gentle, and followed a guard toward the warden's office. The prison camp was situated in the bottom of the quarry and consisted of four sections. The cafeteria and the bath houses were large outdoor areas, while the prisoners' bunks were under large pole buildings without walls. The last area was a compound set aside for the guards, clerks, and the warden.When they arrived at the compound, Thorn had to stifle the urge to chuckle. A seven and a half foot wall surrounded the compound, more than enough to keep out the convict's prying eyes. All but Thorn's, of course. The first day he had come here, the sight of his head appearing above the wall had given the guard watching the gate into the compound quite the fright.Once the guard opened up the thick log gate, Thorn followed the clerk into the compound, down a paved sidewalk, up two flights of stairs, and into the elevated office of the warden. Large glass windows on each side gave the office a 360 degree view of the quarry, and four guards stationed around the office kept a constant lookout for prisoners making trouble.Ducking and turning slightly sideways to squeeze his bulk into the room, Thorn was glad that he could straighten up. Many of the other buildings in the quarry had regular eight foot ceilings, forcing him to duck. Thankfully, the warden's office had a full ten foot ceiling. Smiling at the guards who were all watching him come in, Thorn settled himself in the middle of the room, ignoring the creak of the floor as he shifted his weight.\"Ah. Good evening, Thorn.\" The warden turned around, placing his drink on the large desk. \"Good evening, sir,\" Thorn replied politely, dipping his head slightly.\"I'm sure the clerk informed you that you'll be getting out soon, so I wanted to take an opportunity to have a bit of a chat with you before that.\"\"Yes, sir. He said I was getting out tomorrow.\"\"A welcome surprise, I am sure.\" The warden smiled, adjusting his glasses. \"Though, all of the staff here will miss you. I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say that it has been a pleasure having such a peaceful and hard working resident over the last month. You have been a model inmate, and we will miss your good example.\" The warden paused for a moment to take a drink before continuing. \"You were assigned your prison term due to the assault of another player in a city, is that right?\"\"Yes, sir.\" Thorn nodded.\"Your sentence was originally extended, if I understand these things correctly, because the player you attacked died as the result of your attack. Normally, attacking another player would get you a week in jail, but it was extended because your attack was lethal. Quite surprising that you could actually kill him before the guards got to you.\"\"That is correct, sir. I threw him against a wall. Sometimes I have trouble controlling my strength.\"\"Well, despite the nature of your crime, the powers that be have decided to reduce your sentence due to your good behavior over the last month. However, all of this is contingent on you being willing to accept a parole task.\"\"Parole task?\"\"Yes. Rather than have you stay in prison, I have a task for you to do outside of the quarry. Do you think you are up for it?\"\"Do you mean a quest?\"\"That is exactly what I mean. If you are willing to accept this quest, you are free to leave tomorrow. The rest of your sentence will be waived and, so long as you complete the quest, your criminal title will be removed. Don't break any other laws, and it will be as if none of this ever happened.\"Taking a deep breath, Thorn nodded.\"What do you need me to do?\"", "\"The task is simple.\" The warden straightened his glasses. \"I need you to help solve a problem at another quarry.\"*ding* \"South of here, there is another Fire Iron ore mine that is having a bit of trouble. I'd like for you to head down there, and see what you can do to sort it out. Once you have finished, your criminal title will be removed.\" Seeing Thorn's furrowed brow, the warden smiled encouragingly at him. \"Do you have any questions?\"\"No, sir.\" Thorn put his thoughts in order. \"I am appreciative of this opportunity and will do my best to complete the quest. \"\"Excellent, I am glad to hear that. Alright, you are free to go. Report to the administration station at the breakfast bell tomorrow.\"After leaving the warden's office, Thorn paused a moment to stretch. Standing in-doors made him feel quite cramped. As he made his way back toward the bunk house where he slept with the other inmates, Thorn's mind wandered back to the event that led him to prison. ***Thorn had just arrived back at Berum. After blindly walking around the city for a while, he found himself at the temple, where he sat down for a moment of peace after the emotional turmoil of being betrayed by his friends. Yet his moment of peace was not to be. Just as he had settled into his breathing routine, he caught sight of a familiar figure coming up the steps of the temple. Looking over, eyes hardening, Thorn saw Jorge. At the same time, Jorge caught sight of Thorn's large figure seated on the steps and stopped dead in his tracks, his eyes going wide.\"Hey, Thorn,\" Jorge said, watching him carefully. \"Looks like you made it back. Haha.\"Thorn had expected to be furious if he ever encountered Ouroboros, Mina, Velin, or Jorge, but surprisingly, all he felt was cold. Cold and unnaturally calm.Seeing that the cold look in Thorn's eyes had not receded, Jorge took a small step backward, his hand resting on the pommel of his knife. \"Thorn, I know what Ouroboros did wasn't cool, but you have to understand there is much more at play here. You benefited by following us and paid the price for it. Don't do something you'll regret.\"Slowly, Thorn stood, towering over the dwarf, who put up his hands nervously. \"Whoa there, big guy, let's be gentlemen about this. That business before was just business. Besides, if you draw a weapon, the guards will be all over you.\" Looking at the small figure in front of him, Thorn frowned, his brain working a hundred miles a minute. A glance showed a couple of guards looking over at them.Jorge saw Thorn's glance and laughed. \"Let me give you some advice, kid: don't even bother thinking about revenge. If you do, don't blame me for putting you down again. Haha.\" With another smirk, he turned to go, only to feel a brief sensation of motion before his screen turned black and he disconnected.Stunned, he stood in the familiar white space, the words [You've Died] floating in front of him, accompanied by a timer, counting down.[24:00:00][23:59:59][23:59:58][23:59:57]Thorn had watched as Jorge turned away and, for the briefest of moments, all the cold rationality that enveloped him burned away under pure rage. With a big step forward, his hand shot out, and he grabbed the dwarf, his hand wrapping around Jorge's shoulder. With a swing of his arm, he sent Jorge flying at a nearby wall, watching in satisfaction as the dwarf hit the wall with so much force that his armor deformed.*ding* Feeling quite a bit better, Thorn pressed [Yes]. Though it took awhile for the guards to find chains that fit him, Thorn stood calmly waiting to be taken away. Finally, chains were fitted around his wrists by two heavily perspiring guards. As his vision faded to black, the last thing Thorn saw was a notification. When Thorn awoke, he was in a prison cell, complete with graffiti and a sketchy bunkmate.  Despite the fact that he had taken out his anger on Jorge, the flash of satisfaction that had come from their interaction had crumbled quickly, leaving Thorn upset. After a few days of incarceration, Thorn had volunteered for the quarry, where he had worked until now. ***The morning sun rose hot and early, and the bright rays poked Thorn awake even before the morning breakfast bell rang. Most of the other inmates were sprawled on their hard beds, sleeping for everything they were worth. Countless days of back-breaking labor was a sure recipe for deep sleep, and it was with groans and grumbles that they dragged themselves up at the ringing of the bell.As usual, Thorn was the first one out of bed. A hard day breaking stone and collecting Fire Iron ore hardly tired Thorn at all, so the seven hours of sleep he had gotten was more than enough. Gathering up his few belongings, Thorn made his way over to the administration post, gratefully accepting three loaves of bread and two sausages from one of the cook's helpers on his way. While he could do without sleep, his gargantuan form needed food regularly.\"Hello, Thorn. Here to check out?\"\"Yup. Warden said I'm getting out today.\"While the prison guard in charge of the checkout procedure stamped his papers, Thorn took the opportunity to look around once more. There was a little fondness in his heart for this place. Everything in the quarry was simple and clear cut. There was no confusion or indecision, and most of all, there were no messy relationships. \"Well, maybe one,\" Thorn thought to himself as he spotted Oberlin hurrying over.The thin thief was panting by the time he got near the administration post. One of the guards gripped his spear tightly, dropping the point in Oberlin's path. Stopping quickly, Oberlin's hands went up, and he took a step backwards, eyeing the guard warily.\"Are you being discharged, Thorn?\" A faint anxiousness could be heard in Oberlin's tone.\"Yeah, good behavior.\" Thorn smiled blandly.\"Well, congratulations.\" Oberlin flashed a smile at the giant.\"Thanks. See you around.\" Thorn picked up the paperwork the guard was holding out and collected the gear he had been wearing when he was arrested. With a wave, he walked through the quarry's large gate. *ding* Accompanying the title update was a storm of notifications as his messaging system was unlocked, practically burying Thorn in messages from his aunt. Grimacing, Thorn flicked through them quickly, before dashing off a message. His allotted solo play time wasn't up, but he could not blame his aunt for worrying after not hearing from him for four weeks of in-game time.After answering messages from Dovon, Jarvis, and Hamm, Thorn continued scrolling through the notifications as he walked. The quarry was a few miles from the nearest town, so Thorn headed that direction. Thankfully, his inventory had been unlocked, so he had plenty of food, as the bread and sausage he had eaten on the way out of the quarry did not cut it.About to toss a pastry into his mouth, Thorn suddenly froze, his eyes locked on a blinking notification. He had not seen it in the initial flurry of messages, but there it was, blinking before his eyes. A message from Mina. It took a full two minutes before he could react, and when he finally did, it was just to put away the pastry. Sitting down on the side of the road, Thorn stared at the blinking message, all sorts of feelings trampling across his heart. Hesitating for a moment, Thorn's eyes hovered over the button to open the message, before he sighed and minimized it without opening it.Lying back, he put his hands under his head and stared up at the cloudless sky, beginning to breathe as his master had taught him. Thorn had assumed that the fading of his negative feelings toward Mina and the others meant that he had gotten over their betrayal. His reaction when he saw the message from Mina indicated otherwise. The tumultuous emotions that rushed back were still quite strong, proving that time had only buried them. After a few moments of calm breathing, the pressure in his chest faded, and Thorn got back up to continue on his way. He would worry about the message from Mina later.His distance-eating stride quickly carried him over the hills, and he soon saw the towers of a town peeking over the trees. The quarry he had served his time in was due west of Berum in a mountainous area. On his way there, the prison wagon that had carried him had stopped in the walled city that lay before him. Since his map had been disabled, he didn't know what it was called. According to his re-enabled map, this was the bustling city of Narthil.The gates of the city were patrolled by guards who looked at Thorn with distrust. Having played Nova Terra for a while, Thorn understood that they were reacting to his [Criminal] title, so he did not take it to heart. Rather than find an inn, Thorn restocked his supplies and looked for a map shop.After his ignorance had brought him so much trouble, Thorn had taken full advantage of Oberlin's experience and willingness to talk while they were together. While he could not claim to be an expert, he was certainly not a beginner anymore. One of the things Oberlin had mentioned in passing was that there were shops where maps could be purchased to make travel easier. As Nova Terra did not include any sort of fast travel system, knowing where you were going was essential, so many people sold maps of the places they had been.Once he found the map store, Thorn purchased a general map of the area as well as a map of Narthil. Looking at it intently, he soon spotted what he was looking for, and a quick walk found him in front of a beaten up bar. While he was in jail, he had talked to Oberlin extensively about Nova Terra and had picked up numerous tidbits of information. One piece of information that Thorn had found very interesting was that most people did not use map stores for unlocking new sections of their world map and, instead, tried to find pathfinders. A pathfinder was a Utility class that specialized in exploration and discovery. They could share their maps with other people, normally doing so for a price. Often found hanging around bars and other areas players gathered, pathfinders were the best way to get an accurate map.A faded sign showing a jack of diamonds creaked gently as it hung from a post, one of the supporting chains hanging limp. Cracked and peeling paint suggested that the bar had once been red, but time and dirt made it hard to tell.Pushing the door open, Thorn ducked inside. As he straightened to his full height in the bar area, silence spread out from him in a wave. Already an eye-catching figure, the dark armor granted by his ability [Avatar of the Wolf] added an air of danger to Thorn and combined with his [Criminal] title to create an imposing aura, causing those who filled the bar to look at him carefully. Used to such reactions, Thorn did not bother with them and instead walked to the bar. After eyeing the stools that stood in front of it, Thorn rejected the idea of sitting and placed a massive hand on the bar. \"Hello, what can I do for you?\" The bartender wiped the bar in front of Thorn nervously.\"I'll take a double pint of your special.\"\"Sure, sure.\"Watching the bartender fetch a tall glass from under the counter and head toward the taps, Thorn took a look around the room. As one would expect from a bar in a run down part of town, the room was filled with a variety of dangerous looking characters. A thought flashed through his mind as he looked around, causing Thorn to smile. If he had walked in here a month ago, he probably would have been incredibly nervous. But after his experiences in the quarry, Thorn had gained a matter-of-fact confidence that put him at ease. Thanking the bartender for the beer, Thorn took a sip and grimaced before putting it down carefully. Truly just as bad as Oberlin had mentioned. \"I'm looking for someone who can show me around.\" Thorn spoke to the bartender quietly, causing the rag wiping the bar to pause slightly. Setting the rag down, the bartender placed his hands flat on the bar, his fingers spread for a moment, before picking the rag back up to resume his wiping. Thorn silently stacked up ten silver behind his tall glass.\"Third table along the wall.\" Speaking just as quietly, the bartender did not look up as he smoothly grabbed the coins.With a nod of thanks, Thorn turned around and took a step before stopping with a sigh, totally destroying the mysterious air that had just been built up. There was no way he would be able to squeeze through the tightly packed tables, let alone sit in one of the booths along the wall. Helpless, he could only turn around to ask the bartender for help. Eventually, Thorn found himself in a small back room the bartender lent him, facing the robed and hooded figure who had been sitting at the table along the wall. Catching glimpses of leather armor beneath the robe when the figure entered the room, Thorn was pretty sure this was the person Oberlin had described.\"What do you want?\" Despite the roughness of the question, the figure's voice was pleasant to the ear and pitched higher than Thorn had been expecting.\"Are you a pathfinder? I need information.\"\"Maps or log info? I don't guide, and I won't join your party. I only take gold as payment.\"\"I'm looking for a map and as much information as you have regarding this region.\"\"The whole region?\" The pathfinder's voice lightened, showing her surprise. \"That's expensive.\"\"Yes. As much as you have.\"\"Okay, no problem. Give me a second.\" Pulling out a large, blank piece of smooth leather, the pathfinder held a slim hand against it for a moment. Slowly spreading from her hand, trails of ink curled across the surface of the leather, leaving detailed markings. The whole process took almost seven minutes, and when she was done, the pathfinder flipped the map over and began to scribe in tight script on the back. \"I'm combining all the log information with the map. That will allow you to highlight a place you have not visited and see the info you have received as a popup. Since you are a big customer, I am also adding a couple rumors I've heard. They are probably nothing, but if you are bored, you can check them out.\"", "Thorn left the bar, his wallet four gold lighter but he did not mind. His long discussions with Oberlin in the quarry had made him realize just how important exploration was in Nova Terra. While it would be possible to stay in one place doing the same thing, in-game character growth largely relied on learning more about the world. Thorn had caught glimpses of this through his interactions with Ouroboros and his group, but it was not until Oberlin began to describe his adventures that it really clicked. Ouroboros had been right about one thing: knowledge really did equal power in Nova Terra. The more one knew, the more one could do in here. After all, Nova Terra was just as complex as the real world. The system rewarded players who could creatively apply what they knew about the world and adapted itself to those who treated it seriously.While the map shop in the city could sell maps of the local terrain, the real prize was the map that Thorn had purchased from the pathfinder. Her personal experiences with the region would be invaluable as he began to explore. The day was drawing to a close by the time Thorn left the city, the wall casting a long shadow that met up with the forest.A few minutes after he departed, a small group of strange figures left the city, looking in the direction he had walked. The leader scratched his red beard as he watched the group's ranger looking around for signs of Thorn's passing. \"You sure he's got money?\"\"I'm sure, boss.\" A nervous looking warrior rubbed his hands together as he reassured his boss. \"He paid in gold coins. I saw Emilia spending one, and I know that she didn't have any before.\"\"And you said he is big?\" \"Yeah, probably the biggest guy I've ever seen.\" The nervous warrior shrank slightly as he remembered Thorn's imposing figure.\"That's alright.\" The red bearded warrior spat on the ground, resting his hand on the large axe at his waist. \"The bigger they are, the harder they fall.\"Oblivious to the danger trailing him, Thorn walked to the south west. According to the map that he had purchased, his destination was almost a day's travel south of Narthil, tucked away in the same mountain chain as the quarry where he had spent the last month. Much like the area surrounding Berum, the countryside was forested with gently rolling hills. After night fell, Thorn set up his camp and rested. Truthfully, he was not tired, and he had been eating on the move, so he was only slightly hungry. Instead, Thorn wanted to take a moment to deal with the messages that had piled up during his jail time. Opening up his messaging function, the first thing he saw was the message from Mina. Ignoring it, Thorn answered his other messages one by one. Once he had cleared most of his inbox, Thorn dialed up his aunt Julia. The call connected almost instantly, a video chat opening up in front of Thorn's face. \"Xavier! Finally! Where have you been? Why haven't you been answering my calls? I've been going nuts over here thinking something happened to you! Are you okay?\"\"Yeah, I'm fine.\" Thorn rubbed the back of his head sheepishly. \"I've just been out of touch for a while.\"\"Seriously, what's up with that? What has you so preoccupied you can't even respond to a message? Wait, why is your tag red? You're a criminal? You are a criminal!?\"\"Uh, yeah. I might have attacked someone in a town accidently.\"\"What do you mean accidently?\" Julia's eye narrowed as she glared at her nephew. \"You have been incommunicado for a full month. Fighting in town is a max seven days.\"\"Umm, maybe more on purpose than accidently.\" Thorn scratched his cheek, embarrassed. \"And I might have killed him. I'm actually out on parole right now.\"\"Wow, I let you start Nova Terra, and you go straight for the criminal behavior, huh?\"\"Well, a lot of stuff happened.\"Seeing the mixed expression on Thorn's face, Julia's gaze softened.\"Yeah? Why don't you tell me about it?\"For the next twenty minutes, Thorn recounted his adventures since arriving in Nova Terra. He told his aunt about how had he fumbled around the game at the beginning, and how the trainers at the Training Hall had taken him under their wings. About Mina and Ouroboros, Velin and Jorge. About his encounter with the Blood Hunter, Gargish, and battling the elementals in the Elemental Gorge.Finally, his mood heavy, he spoke about the group's encounter in Hati's Ascent, how they had battled through the dungeon, arriving at the final boss. And how, after beating Karrandras himself, the others turned on him, stripping him of his Awakening points and leaving him for dead.Julia fell silent as he finished telling her his story. From Thorn's tone and downcast expression, she could tell how very deeply wounded he was. And no wonder. It made Julia's heart ache just hearing about his first friends throwing him aside for benefits like that, so she could only imagine what Thorn must have been feeling. \"Do you want me to find them for you?\" While her tone was even and her face calm, Thorn could tell from the cold look in Julia's eyes that she was truly furious at what he had experienced. With the fifth strongest guild in the game at her back, finding Ouroboros and exacting revenge on Thorn's behalf was not out of the question.\"No, thanks, though.\"\"It wouldn't be hard, Xavier. The Society of Roses has a great network, and it would not take much to find them.\"\"I appreciate the intent, but I think I want to handle this on my own.\" Thorn shook his head firmly.\"Alright.\" Julia fell silent. Despite the heaviness on his face, she could see the quiet resolve underneath it. \"Listen, kid. I am so sorry for what you went through, but remember, suffering sucks, but...\"\"Suffering is the foundation of success,\" Thorn finished the statement she often told him. \"You are right.\" With a big sigh, Thorn felt the last of the pent up emotions leaving his chest. The remaining anger, frustration, bitterness, and pain disappeared with the cool night breeze.\"Thanks for listening.\" Smiling at his aunt, Thorn felt much better. \"Besides, it isn't all bad. I'm stuck with a single class, but I got a pretty sweet title out of it.\"\"That's right.\" Happy to see her nephew perk up, Julia changed the subject. \"You never told me what happened after they left you. How did you make it back to the city?\"\"Well, I thought I was dead, but it turned out there was a bit of a glitch. I pseudo-died, but there was an issue with the pod that they are fixing. So I actually did not respawn in the city. Instead, I woke up in the dungeon. Anyway, I met Hati, the Moon Wolf.\"\"Wait, the god? The god of night?\" Seeing Thorn's nod, Julia flipped out. \"Are you serious!? Gods exist? This changes everything! We assumed they had all been killed! If Hati is still around, then I bet there are other gods hiding as well! What was it like?\"\"Pretty intense. Hati is a giant wolf, obviously, but by giant, I mean like as big as the world. Anyway, more importantly, Hati gave me a title, which combined with another title I have, so now I am [Lord Greymane, the Moon Wolf]. I'm the Avatar of the Moon Wolf and the leader of the Wolfkin, though I think I still have a lot to do before I can actually assume that position.\"For a moment, silence reigned as Thorn's normally unflappable aunt stared at him in undisguised shock, her mouth hanging open. Taken aback by her reaction, Thorn could barely resist poking the screen, wondering if it had frozen. \"WHAAAAAT!\" Startled by Julia's scream, Thorn jumped slightly.\"You are the avatar of the Moon Wolf? And what is with that five word title?! Titles like that are insanely rare. As in, I only know of two other players in the entire game who have a five word title.\"\"Yeah, Hati said something about sending me down a different path, since I could no longer take multi-category classes. After thinking about it, I think they meant that I could use a title to make up for it. The title comes with four different abilities, all of which can grow and get more powerful. As I've been considering their application, it seems like the title is a mini-version of a quad category class. The abilities fit under Combat, Support, Utility, and Leadership.\"\"Hold on, it is a title? Not a class? This is starting to make sense. Old legends talk about the god's avatars, but all this time people have been searching for them as if they were classes. To no avail, I might add. It has been assumed that you could become an avatar if you found the correct class combination, but from what you experienced, that is obviously not the case. You said Hati picked you?\"\"Mmhmm. Hati was watching me and liked my character or something like that.\"\"You keep saying they. You don't know if Hati is male or female?\" Julia looked at Thorn skeptically.\"Haha, no,\" Thorn chuckled sheepishly. \"I only saw the top of their nose and eyes. Bit hard to tell, and I don't want to get struck by lightning.\"Julia smiled, happy that her nephew was able to be in high spirits despite his situation. A few minutes later, she waved goodbye, after making Thorn promise to contact her more frequently. They were almost halfway through Thorn's one year free range wandering agreement, and she was starting to think about how he would fit into her guild.Thorn, on the other hand, was not thinking about the future at all. While he had been stuck in prison, he had spent almost all of his time thinking about the future, but right now he was just taking a break and enjoying the soft crackle of his fire and the cool night air.*snap*The faint sound of a cracking tree branch woke Thorn from his daze. Someone was coming. Ever since his encounter with Hati, the Moon Wolf, Thorn had found his senses sharpening considerably, allowing him to instinctively judge how far away the broken branch was and in roughly what direction.Staying seated, Thorn flipped over his hand, pulling his tetsubo out of his inventory and placing it across his knees. Running his fingers over the metal protrusions on its end, Thorn couldn't help but wonder where Master Sun was. Slowly, the sounds grew louder as the oncoming  group got closer to his camp, eventually coming to a stop about fifty feet away from the fire. Thorn had chosen to settle in a natural clearing where the ground dipped slightly, providing a bit of protection for his fire. Since Thorn carried ready-made food in his inventory, the fire was not used for cooking, so Thorn let it blaze merrily. After a slight pause, the group made their way forward, soon stepping into the light of the fire. Thorn counted four people, making a mental note that there was probably an assassin of some sort sneaking around. Watching Ouroboros' team operate had been quite the education for Thorn, and after personally experiencing Jorge's backstab, Thorn had vowed in his heart never to forget about assassins.The most eye-catching of the group was a large man with a full, red beard and scars across his right eye. Almost 6' 5\", the bearded man was covered in chain mail and carried a large bladed axe at his belt with a buckler on his left forearm. Next to him stood two yellow robed, bald-headed figures, one holding a four ringed khakkhara staff while the other held a golden vajra. Both monks held their weapons in front of them solemnly, staring at Thorn as if he was a great demon. Peeking out from behind the rest of the group, a brown haired warrior watched Thorn nervously, his hands rubbing together.\"Good evening.\" Since they remained silent, Thorn decided to open up the conversation. \"Welcome to my camp. I'm happy to have you join me.\"Having looked around the camp and seen that Thorn was alone, the red bearded man chuckled to himself and rested his hand on his axe. Waving his other hand, he signaled for the two monks to spread out, surrounding Thorn from three sides. The nervous warrior stayed behind Red Beard, his eyes flicking to the forest behind Thorn.\"Let's make this short and sweet. Hand over all your gold and credits, and you won't get hurt,\" said Red Beard, his eyes narrowed.\"You are robbing me?\" Thorn was slightly stunned.\"Yeah, and if you don't play along, I don't mind sending you back to spawn,\" Red Beard spat.\"Oh, wow. Well. This is a novel experience.\" Thorn, seeming unperturbed, wrapped his hand around the tetsubo's handle and stood up. And up. As he stood, the two monks on either side of him tightened their grip on their weapons, each taking a small step back. One began to chant to himself in a low voice, the other just gawked. The red bearded robber in front of Thorn looked up at him before whispering ferociously to the cowering warrior behind him. \"I thought you said he was big?\"\"He is big.\"\"That's not big; that is giant! Forget it.\" Turning his glare back on Thorn, Red Beard pulled out his axe. \"I guess you want to play the hard way, huh?\"\"Whoa, wait. Hold up.\"Seeing Thorn's hand go up, Red Beard paused. \"I don't even know who you are. Don't you think you should introduce yourself?\"\"Actually, he's right,\" nodded the monk with the mace. \"I'm Mali, the Enlightened Buddha, and that is my brother, Jamir, the Evil Monk, over there.\" He motioned with his mace, pointing at the other monk who was still chanting.\"Hi.\" Jamir paused his chant long enough to nod his head.\"Nice to meet you. I'm Thorn.\" \"Enough!\" For some reason, seeing their friendly exchange made Red Beard furious. \"My name is Pulen Blood Beard, and it'll be the last thing you'll hear!\" Roaring this out, he raised his axe and was about to jump forward when Mali, the Enlightened Buddha yelled out, \"Wait!\"\"Oh, for crying out loud, what is it now?\" Pulen turned his glare on the yellow robed monk.\"If you say it that way, the last thing he will hear is you saying, 'it'll be the last thing you'll hear'. Shouldn't you say it the other way around? Like, 'the last thing you hear will be the sound of my name, Pulen Blood Beard!' Then, whoosh! Slice him with your axe.\"\"But then he will hear the axe, right?\" Taking interest in the conversation, Jamir stopped his chanting to chime in. \"So the actual last thing he will hear will be the whoosh of the axe.\"\"Ah, that is true.\" Mali nodded sagely.", "Amused, Thorn watched the monks toss ideas back and forth. Before they could come to a consensus on the best way to deliver the line, their boss, Pulen Blood Beard, flipped out. Thorn had been keeping an eye on him from across the fire so he was ready when, roaring in rage, Blood Beard launched himself forward.\"Wave Crossing Chop!\" he yelled. His jump brought him smoothly across the fire, and he landed steadily in front of Thorn, bringing his axe down in an over head chop. At the same moment, a faint twang sounded, like the string of a guitar being plucked, and an arrow shot from the darkness toward Thorn's back.Startled by their boss' sudden move, the two monks dropped their discussion and raised their weapons, striking from the side. Despite the four rings banging around on the khakkhara staff, the weapon made no sound as it struck at Thorn's feet. Rather, it was the mace that let out an evil wail as it swung toward Thorn's right shoulder. From how smoothly the attacks came in it, was obvious that the group had practiced this attack often, and they were quite proficient ambushers.Initially, Thorn planned on meeting the axe head on, but the arrow shooting toward the center of his back made that a dangerous gamble. While Thorn was wearing armor, who knew if the arrow had any special ability. Instead, Thorn lifted his tetsubo in a smooth motion, jabbing it at the mace-wielding monk on his right while twisting his body to the side to move out of the way of the arrow.The abrupt shift caused the arrow to miss and Mali to step back, but the other two attackers adjusted their weapons' trajectories, continuing to smash toward Thorn. With a slight smile, Thorn took a large step forward, his massive stride taking him well out of the reach of Jamir's staff and Pulen's axe. Mali was still moving backwards as Thorn pressed forward, his maces attemting to ward off Thorn's tetsubo, which seemed to have transformed into a spear.Aware that another arrow was probably on its way, Thorn abruptly changed directions. Turning his body toward Pulen Blood Beard, he stepped forward again, lashing out at the chain-mailed warrior with a horizontal strike. The red-bearded warrior was in the middle of an attack himself and could only brace himself as he saw the blur of the tetsubo coming toward him.With a loud bang, the steel-wrapped weapon smashed into Pulen's side. Shock flashed across his face briefly as his body immediately turned into small motes of light that drifted up into the sky. For a moment, there was silence as the other attackers stared at the place where Pulen had stood in utter astonishment. Had he really just died from a single hit?The warrior who had been following Pulen was the first to react, giving a high pitched scream and running away as fast as he possibly could. Mali quickly backed off a few steps as well, his eyes extra wide. On the other side, Jamir put his hands together and started chanting again, though it was obvious how nervous he was from the sweat that began to bead his brow.Keeping an ear out for the sound of the archer in the woods, Thorn glanced at the two monks. His one strike seemed to have knocked the fight right out of them.\"So, are we going to keep going or what?\" he asked, spinning his tetsubo in his hand. \"There is no need, no need.\" Mali's maces disappeared, and he waved his hands frantically at Thorn. \"As the Buddha has said, 'Let's not fight' and 'It is better to show mercy than to build a ten story pagoda.\"Ignoring Thorn's puzzled look, Mali rushed over to stand next to Jamir, who was still softly chanting.\"Benefactor, we will not bother you anymore. Come, Jamir, let us leave this wise man to his thinking.\" Mali bowed his head repeatedly toward Thorn and, grabbing the other monk by his arm, pulled Jamir into the woods as quickly as he could.Thorn watched until they were out of sight before using the end of his weapon to poke through the few things that Pulen Blood Beard dropped when he died. Apart from the small amount of coins, there was a set of bracers and a half-used sharpening stone. Pocketing the coins, Thorn tossed the armor and sharpening stone into his inventory. The bracers were much too small for him, so he did not even bother examining them.Sitting down by the fire again, Thorn stretched out and closed his eyes. It was obvious that Pulen Blood Beard had been the motivating force behind the attempted robbery, and since he would not be able to log in for twenty-four hours, Thorn was not concerned that they would be back to try again.The next morning found Thorn well on his way to Embersplit Mine. He had woken up while it was still dark and started on his way after cleaning up his camp. Because it was night, his ability [Blessing of the Moon] activated, granting him excellent night vision, so walking in the dark was no problem. It was mid-morning when he finally arrived at the sprawling town. Unlike Berum and Narthil, the town of Embersplit had no wall. The buildings were largely wooden, hastily constructed and seeming in danger of tumbling down at any moment. Mentally, Thorn swore to be extra careful as he walked around. It would be an utter disaster if he were to accidentally knock most of the town down.The mine was located on the north-west side of the town, tucked in between two mountains. Unlike the quarry, the mine was not open-air. Instead it dove deep into the mountain range through a series of twisting tunnels.*ding*Calling up his notifications, Thorn saw that he had a chat request from Oberlin.\"Hey, Thorn! How is it going?\" Oberlin flashed his trademark smile.\"Aren't you still supposed to be in prison?\"\"Eh, details.\" Oberlin waved dismissively. \"I heard you are headed to Embersplit. That is really quite a coincidence, because I happen to be there right now.\"\"Yeah, what a coincidence.\" Thorn rolled his eyes. There was no doubt in his mind that the thief had peeked at the documents in the warden's office before breaking out of the quarry.\"We should totally meet up. I am at the Green Goblin in the center of town.\"Knowing that Oberlin would not let him go, Thorn sighed and agreed to meet him. As he closed the call, Thorn could not help but wonder if he was forever cursed to be hounded by over-enthusiastic people. The Green Goblin was a squat building situated in between a general goods store and the local surveyor's office. According to the sign hanging crookedly on the wall, it was the oldest inn in town, having been established when the Embersplit mine was first discovered. Staring at the doorway skeptically, Thorn called up Oberlin.\"There is no way I am fitting inside this place. How about you come out?\"\"Huh? Oh, right. Yeah, sorry. I did not think about that. I'll be right out. We can stay somewhere else.\"\"I'm planning on camping out near the mine anyway. I am pretty sure that if I touch any of the buildings in town they are going to collapse.\"\"Haha, that would be quite something.\" Oberlin walked out of the inn and patted Thorn on the arm. \"Good to see you again, buddy. So, do you need any help with your quest? Since we're both here, why don't we team up and help each other?\"\"Will you allow me to refuse?\"\"Haha, no, probably not.\" Oberlin gave a small smile. \"You are pretty much my only shot at completing my quest, so I'm afraid I'm going to keep bothering you until you say yes. But I'm happy to help you with whatever you need to do first. Don't you have a quest to get rid of your criminal status?\"Sighing, Thorn decided to give up trying to shake Oberlin off. If their time in prison had taught him anything it was that the thief was persistent. \"Alright, you can help. Step one is gathering information. I want to go scope out the mine and talk to the mine supervisor, so let's head that direction. According to the quest, the miners are not meeting their quota, which could mean any number of things.\"\"That doesn't tell us anything.\" Oberlin's brow furrowed as he read the quest description that Thorn shared with him.\"Actually, it gives us a couple really useful pieces of information. First, the problem is solvable. And not through mining. That is, I don't have to do the mining work. The quest is expecting me to clear whatever obstacle is keeping the miners from being productive. Second, because something is keeping the miners from being productive, we know that whatever the problem is, it is probably not an issue of the miner's attitudes. And even if it is an issue of attitudes, it is likely that there is a simple and direct solution.\"After all, the quest is expecting me to be able to clear it in a short amount of time. Third, I did a bit of research about Ember Iron, which is the mine's primary mineral. Unlike normal iron, Ember Iron is actually a type of coal used to increase the temperature of smith's forges. It allows for more efficient smelting and is in high demand. However, Embersplit mine is known to be one of the smallest Ember Iron mines already, so the fact that the production has fallen is not actually a serious issue. This leads me to believe that the reason I was dispatched to the mine is less about the actual production levels and more about resolving a different issue. The production is just being used as cover.\"As the two walked out of town, they talked about possible problems the mine could be facing that would cause production to slow down. After concluding that there were way too many possibilities, they began to talk of other things. The mine entrance was roughly a quarter of a mile away from the town of Embersplit, so it did not take them long to reach it. A wooden fence surrounded the naturally formed cave entrance, and a guard dressed in rusty armor sat near the door, dozing in the sun. Opening his eyes as Thorn's shadow fell over him, the guard was so startled he fell backwards off his stool.\"We are here to see the mine supervisor.\" Just as Thorn was about to speak, Oberlin stepped forward and stared down at the guard. \"O...okay.\" Recovering slightly from his shock, the guard got to his feet and opened the fence door. Thorn and Oberlin followed right behind him, stepping into the fenced-in area in front of the cave mouth. Oberlin looked around with interest while Thorn examined the cave before sighing with relief. It looked high enough that he would not have to duck.After a few minutes, a frazzled-looking man stumbled out of one of the buildings, still trying to tuck his shirt tails in, without much luck. Unkempt hair pointed this way and that, and one of his suspenders had fallen from his shoulder, making one side of his pants sag dangerously low. Hurrying toward them, the man slowed down drastically as he got close and took in Thorn's staggering height. \"Hello. Are you the supervisor here?\" Thorn spoke in as friendly a tone as he could manage. \"My name is Thorn. I've been assigned a parole quest to help you determine why your production has fallen off in the recent months.\"\"Hello, hello. Welcome.\" Nodding his head repeatedly, the mine supervisor invited them into his office. \"I am Supervisor Hobson. I am in charge of day-to-day operations here at the mine. Thank you for coming out to help us figure out the issue.\"\"Why don't you tell us about what is going on. When did you notice something wrong?\"\"Of course, of course. So, everything was normal up until three months ago. Production was normal for the first half of the month, but it suddenly dropped due to a small cave-in. After that, it recovered slightly, but then it dropped back down by the end of the month. It has been sporadic ever since.\"\"How do you measure your production? Is it simply by the weight of the Ember Iron you pull out?\"\"No, no, we only weigh them to verify the number of pieces that we bring out of the mine.\" Supervisor Hobson opened a cabinet and pulled out three pieces of orange and brown ore. \"Ember Iron is a strange mineral in that all the pieces are uniform in size and density. See, the variation on them is incredibly small. This is one of the advantages of Ember Iron as a consumable; it makes for a controllable fire. \"It also means it is easy to determine the mine's production. We used to count the number of Ember Iron bars pulled out of the mine each day and then weigh them to verify, but these days we mostly just weigh them and then pay accordingly. Recently, though, we have been finding that our monthly totals have been lower than they should have been. Part of that is due to losing one of our best miners, who quit. I'm worried that, when the end of the year comes, we will be so far behind that the mine will be closed down.\"\"We'll need to see your books.\" Stepping out from beside Thorn, Oberlin smiled his best smile. \"And you are?\" Supervisor Hobson looked at the thin thief warily. \"This is Oberlin,  my partner. He will be helping me with the investigation.\" Thorn rested a big hand on Oberlin's shoulder. \"We will not only need to see your books, but if you have a list of your employees and schedules for the last couple months, that would be helpful as well.\"\"Of course, of course. Please give me one moment.\" After pulling the documents out, Supervisor Hobson left the two of them alone, saying, \"I have to go see what the miners have produced today. If there is anything you need, just come get me.\"Watching the supervisor leave, Oberlin had a strange look in his eyes. Turning to Thorn, who was looking through the schedule, he hesitated for a moment, before saying softly, \"He is lying, you know.\"\"Hmm?\" Thorn looked up, a large finger marking his place on the page.\"The supervisor is not telling the truth about something. He is really nervous for some reason. In my line of work being able to spot lies is really important, and he was definitely concealing the truth.\"\"Is that so?\" Thorn couldn't help but smile. This was getting more and more interesting. \"Do me a favor: go find out where Margo Talern is. Try to do it without alerting anyone, though.\"\"Margo Talern?\"\"Yeah, he was a miner. According to this schedule, his last week was the week that there was a sharp drop in production. I'm going to keep looking over the books.\"\"Got it, leave it to me.\" Nodding his head, Oberlin left the office as Thorn busied himself with the account books.", "After poring over the books for almost two hours, Thorn straightened and stretched his arms. The numbers were tedious but important, and he was starting to get a clearer picture of what had happened since the initial drop in production. Now to see what Oberlin had dug up.Thorn found Oberlin hanging out by the front gate, chatting with the guard who had been lounging there when they first arrived. Seeing Thorn coming, Oberlin coughed and pretended to be in a serious conversation with the guard, even magically producing a pad of paper as if he was taking notes.\"Thanks for your help, Charles. I'll let you know if there is anything else we need.\" Oberlin pretended to have just seen Thorn as he put the pad away. \"Oh, I didn't see you there, sir. I just finished up the last interview with Charles here. He was very cooperative.\" Oberlin threw a poorly concealed wink at the guard.\"Good, follow me back to camp,\" Thorn commanded, running his eyes over the guard's rumpled uniform. With a bit of a sniff, he walked out the gate and left the mine. After a few steps Oberlin caught up, and Thorn shortened his stride so the thief did not have to run to keep up. They proceeded in silence until they were well out of earshot of the mining camp. \"You were onto something,\" Oberlin said, his voice laced with excitement. \"Officially, that Margo guy got let go and moved to another region to take care of his sick relative. But I got a look at the mine's sign-in sheet. You know, where the miners sign in and out of their shifts? His signature from that date was forged. Pretty crappy forgery, too. Looks like someone tried to use a tracing method to make it look like he signed out of his shift midweek and did not come back the next day. In actuality, he went in on a Wednesday morning and never came out. At least, according to the sign-in sheet.\"\"That means we need to get into the mine.\"\"Exactly. Chances are he got whacked while he was in the mine.\"\"Whacked?\"\"Yeah, you know, killed?\"\"Right. That is a possibility.\"\"Look at you being so calm. Did you find anything else in the books? You were in there a lot longer than I thought you would be.\"\"They were interesting. Not only do they record the total amount gathered, but they also record the individual collection rates of the miners. About two and a half months ago, they had a really low production day because there was a reported collapse, right? After that, Margo Talern 'quit' suddenly. I looked through the individual records, and he was one of the highest producers in the mine. What is especially fascinating is that the miner with the next highest production record, Reeve Hewet, has been having a lot of low production days recently. \"We need to get into the mine and talk to Mr. Hewet. Additionally, we need to check out the ore they are pulling out of the mine. The weights do not match up. If we add up all the weight that the individual miners get credited with, the number is much higher than amount stored. Somewhere between the collection point and the storage, they are losing the weight. Which means something that is being brought out of the mine is being removed before the monthly collection.\"\"You want to go back after dark?\"\"No, I want you to go back after dark. Stealth is one area where I am not naturally gifted. Two months ago, the night guard was replaced with a Jonas Hewet who, I'm guessing, is related to Reeve Hewet. I need you to sneak back in and check what is happening after dark. Tonight would be the night for them to get rid of any evidence of what is going on.\"\"You got all that from reading some records?\" Oberlin looked at Thorn from the corner of his eye. \"Are you sure you have never been a criminal?\"Not bothering to respond, Thorn stopped once they were halfway between the mine and the town and began to set up camp. \"We will camp here. Once it gets dark, you can head back.\"A few hours later, Thorn sat watching the flickering flames of his campfire, thinking about the strangeness of his life. Oberlin had gone back to investigate the mine camp, leaving Thorn to finish his dinner. Now, sitting by the fire as the cool night breeze blew past, Thorn had to chuckle. So much had happened in the last few months.He had gone from naivety to heartbreak. From extreme discomfort to physically unstoppable. From law abiding to incarcerated. And now he was seriously investigating the potential murder of a bunch of data by another bunch of data. What a strange, strange world.With a long sigh, Thorn decided to stop thinking about it and just go to bed. Better to face what was in front of him than try to avoid it. Just as he was about to climb into his oversized tent, he froze, remembering the message from Mina that he still had not opened. He had tossed it to the bottom of his messages, resolutely ignoring it. But wasn't that just avoiding the difficulty? Wasn't his refusal to deal with the message a refusal to deal with the messiness of his relationships? Thorn knew deep in his heart that the correct way to handle the distress of a broken relationship was to face the reality of it head on. Only then could he make the choice to either try and fix it or cut it completely loose. By hanging on to the unopened message, wasn't he just prolonging the pain it caused?Glumly, Thorn sat back down by the fire. If he was going to face life head on, then he was going to have to face this relationship head on as well. Moving slowly, Thorn opened his messages and pulled Mina's message up to the top, his finger hovering over the button to open it.\"Thorn, Thorn! You were right, they are moving something!\" Abruptly Oberlin's shadowed face appeared in front of Thorn in a video message, startling him badly. \"You've got to get over here! Don't worry about being quiet. I'll give you the details on the way.\"\"Alright, I'm on my way.\" Standing, Thorn waved his hand, collecting the two tents to his inventory and kicking the logs in the fire apart so they would die out. Within moments, he was thundering toward the mine. \"What is the situation?\"\"Wow, is that you thumping? You were not kidding about being unsuited for stealth. I can hear you from here!\" Oberlin looked surprised.\"You told me not to worry about it.\" Thorn was annoyed. His long stride ate up the distance, each footfall leaving a deep impression in the ground. \"I'll be there in 30 seconds or so, you better tell me what is going on.\"\"Nine players showed up and started arguing with Supervisor Hobson. They almost came to blows, but it is obvious the players are elites. They have not spotted me, but it was a close thing. They are loading up a cart full of some sort of ore that doesn't look like Ember Iron. I can't tell what it is from here, but they took it out of the storage shed, just like you suspected. Are you sure you are not accompanied by a herd of elephants? I'm literally shaking.\" Oberlin held up his hand that was vibrating slightly.Ignoring him, Thorn hit the gate of the mine with his shoulder, smashing through it like it was not even there. Splinters peppered the ground around him as he slid to a stop in front of a large carriage that was being loaded with boxes. Cloaked figures stood around the carriage as a couple of miners loaded the boxes of ore into it. Three quickly detached themselves from the group, rushing toward Thorn, weapons drawn. His eyes taking them all in, Thorn noticed that two members of the group had bows. Making a mental note to watch for arrows, Thorn brought his focus back to the three enemies in his face. In perfect coordination, the three players attacked. Activating some sort of ability, the two players on the sides slid forward, their swords slashing out at Thorn's arms while the player in front of him stabbed forward with a thin blade.Without panicking, Thorn stepped forward to break their momentum, his tetsubo flicking across his body toward the player on his left who was forced to jump back. With a twist of his body, his weapon cut through the air, forcing the player in front of him to pull his thrust back, before smashing into the last attacker's back. Without even looking, Thorn knew that player wouldn't survive the strike, so he swiftly stepped forward and grabbed the player with the thin sword, his massive hand covering their shoulder. Squeezing, Thorn heard a yelp of pain and the clatter of the weapon falling to the ground, so he tossed them aside while aiming an overhead strike at the last attacker. Unable to block the force, the cloaked figure disappeared into lights to join his companion, and Thorn stood facing the rest of the group.Six cloaked figures stared in shock at the giant in front of them. His moves were smooth and well practiced, a strong blend of power and grace. After a brief moment of silence, the two with bows pulled them swiftly and the rest of the players drew their weapons. Just as they were about to rush forward, a voice came from behind the cart.\"What is going on here?\" A handsome young man in red leather armor with a silver trim walked forward, two figures in cloaks behind him. \"Who is he?\"\"Who are you?\" Thorn asked, his voice overlapping with the handsome man's.\"Were you hired to stop us?\" The handsome man's voice gained a cold edge as he saw that two of his nine men were dead and another was wounded. \"Who hired you? Theropholi? Alexandar? Ouroboros?\"Taken aback, Thorn looked at the players in front of him carefully. Their well-coordinated movements had reminded him of Ouroboros and his team, but he had assumed that it was because they were elite players. \"How do you know Ouroboros?\" asked Thorn, his deep voice rumbling around the compound.\"How do I know Ouroboros? Are you kidding?\" The handsome man was confused. \"You were not hired to stop us? Then why are you here?\"\"You are stealing. I'm here to stop you.\"In the pregnant silence that followed, the sound of Oberlin facepalming could be heard clearly from the darkness where he hid.\"Haha, is that right?\" Once he recovered from his shock, the handsome man laughed. Gesturing to the two people behind him, he smiled at Thorn. \"In that case, you will not mind me getting rid of you.\"Throwing off their cloaks, a man and a woman moved forward to stand in front of Thorn. Dressed in the same red armor that the handsome man wore, each had a shield and a scimitar. From their confident gaze and steady gait, Thorn knew they were going to be trouble. Both the man and the woman walked like Hamm, the sword trainer in Berum, instantly setting off alarm bells in Thorn's head. He had never managed to win a fight against Hamm, which did not bode well for his chances here.Nervous energy blossomed briefly in Thorn's mind as he stared at the two players in front of him. Yet the increasingly familiar burning excitement in his chest soon drowned it out. Ever since he had faced Gargish, the Blood Hunter, Thorn had found himself increasingly drawn to combat, no matter how dangerous. Now, facing two expert fighters, Thorn could feel that excitement growing, making his hands itch.Just as the man was about to open his mouth, Thorn couldn't help himself. A long step forward put him directly in front of the man, and his fist flew out, punching forward. Startled, the man showed his training, managing to get his shield up before Thorn could hit him. Taking the blow on his shield, the man was still thrown back off his feet, flying backwards.His partner, seeing Thorn strike, slashed toward him with her scimitar, its edge lit by a sickly green glow. Thorn caught the scimitar on his tetsubo, frowning slightly as the scimitar bit a chunk out of his weapon.\"Telis, get back!\" The handsome man shouted, looking hard at Thorn before calling out, \"Formation three.\"Instantly, all of the remaining players split up to surround Thorn while the female warrior, who had jumped back, went to assist her male companion who was still struggling to his feet. Seeing his shield arm hanging uselessly, she couldn't help but gasp. Thorn's punch, which had looked rather casual, had contained enough force to dislocate the man's arm.Gritting his teeth, the red-armored warrior mumbled under his breath. A thick red glow seeped from between his lips as he spoke, surrounding his shoulder and healing him. Within a few moments, his arm was back to normal, and he and Telis joined the rest of the players in surrounding Thorn.Watching the eight players around him, Thorn could tell that he was in a lot of trouble. It was obvious from their movements that they were well trained, and that spelled danger. He had taken the initiative to surprise attack the red-armored warrior and had not even been able to deal any permanent damage. While it looked as if he had the advantage, the swift response from the female warrior and the handsome man in the back had destroyed any edge Thorn had gained.Now, surrounded by eight players, Thorn knew his chances were plummeting. \"Then lets maximize my value,\" Thorn thought, his eyes locking onto the handsome man standing in the back. Feeling Thorn's gaze settle on him, the hair on the back of the handsome man's neck rose instantly, and a cold chill ran down his spine. \"Get him!\" he screamed, pointing at Thorn.Mentally Thorn measured the distance. 50 feet. Obstacles include four players and possibly a carriage of ore. Doable. As the other players reacted to the command, Thorn threw back his head and howled, the cry echoing eerily around the mine compound.Stunned, the players surrounding him stumbled as his [Wolf Lord's Howl] ability activated. At the same time, Thorn activated [Avatar of the Wolf]. Streaks of silver flew from the the moon, surrounding Thorn's gauntlets as razor sharp claws formed on his fingers. Taking advantage of the disarray in the formation around him, Thorn dashed forward, heading straight for the handsome man standing next to the carriage.", "Seeing Thorn's charge, the handsome man growled and muttered under his breath, the same thick red mist seeping from his lips to surround him in a swirling red shield. At the same time, he pulled a scepter from his waist and pointed its barbed tip toward Thorn. Another muttered command sent a scarlet bolt of energy shooting toward Thorn!As soon as the sceptre appeared, Thorn instinctively knew he could not face it head on. Angling his body, he dashed diagonally, putting the carriage between them. Undeterred, the bolt of energy punched through the wall of the carriage, searing a deep line across Thorn's arm. Hissing in pain, Thorn braced himself and grabbed the carriage. With a heave, he lifted it from the ground and tossed it at the players charging from behind him. The carriage trembled as it flew through the air, the sheer unexpectedness of the situation causing a number of the chasing players to forget to dodge. With a tremendous crash, the carriage came back down to earth, crushing four of them. Amid the splintered debris, anguished screams sounded from those under the carriage's broken bulk.Not even bothering to look at his handiwork, Thorn resumed his dash toward the handsome man, whose face was white as a sheet. As he charged, Thorn felt the bite of an arrow in his shoulder. Gritting his teeth to ignore the sting, Thorn focused all of his attention on getting to the handsome man. Another scarlet bolt lanced forward, this time hitting Thorn in his side, cutting through his armor and leaving a massive smoldering wound along his ribs.\"Two more steps,\" Thorn thought, narrowing his focus even further. Readying his weapon, Thorn crossed the last twenty feet in two of his massive strides. Smashing down with all the force he could muster, Thorn brought his iron-bound tetsubo down on the shifting red magical shield that surrounded the handsome man.Horrified, his target broke into a hurried mumble. A deep stream of red mist poured from his mouth, reinforcing the shield. With a crack that shook the ground, the tetsubo landed on the shield, instantly causing a massive amount of the mist to dissipate but not managing to get through. Seeing the thin layer of mist still swirling in front of him, Thorn tossed his weapon into his inventory and reached out his massive clawed hands, forcefully grabbing the bubble of mist and squeezing it with all his might. With an ominous groan, the shield warped as Thorn's claws pushed into it. The shield thinned at a visible rate, the stream of mist pouring from the handsome man's mouth unable to reinforce it quickly enough. Just as the silver claws were about to pierce through, Thorn felt a stinging pain. The other players had caught up, burying their blades in Thorn's broad back. Ignoring his dimming world, Thorn gritted his teeth and redoubled his efforts, pouring all of his strength into breaking the shield.With an ear-rending crack, the mist shield shattered into nothingness, causing the handsome man to stagger in pain as the feedback hit him. Thorn lashed out wildly, his claws connecting with the handsome man's chest. Yet, just as he made contact, the red-armored woman landed a strike to his neck, causing the strength to drain from his hands. Still, the weight of the blow could not be stopped and, as Thorn fell to the ground, he could feel his claws ripping a furrow through the front of the handsome man's red-armor.Still trying to fight off the encroaching darkness, Thorn grinned. This was the first time he had used any of his new abilities and, despite not managing to get his main target, he was quite pleased. \"We'll try this again another time.\" Thorn's deep voice sent chills down the handsome man's spine.Hearing Thorn's defiant statement, Telis readied her scimitar for another strike, only for Thorn to turn into motes of light, drifting off to the aether. Scrambling to his feet, white faced and shaking, the handsome man looked around and let out a string of obscenities. Seven of his eleven subordinates were dead and he was badly wounded. The carriage lay in shambles, the wheels and walls splintered beyond repair. In the distance, he could hear the shouts of the town guards on their way to the mine.\"Koral, get the ore, we're leaving,\" he snarled. Who was that monster? And why had he shown up tonight? \"Um, Boss?\" The red-armored warrior looked up from where he had been searching through the wreckage of the carriage. \"It's gone.\"\"What?!\" the handsome man screamed, the veins on his neck popping out. A hundred feet away, Oberlin smiled at the sound, patting his belt. As the world faded to black, Thorn found himself standing in the now familiar login area. As before, Myst stood in front of him, holding her tablet.\"Hello, Myst,\" Thorn greeted her warmly. \"It is nice to see you again.\"\"Hello, traveler. You seem quite cheerful for having just experienced your first death. Would you like to talk about it?\"\"Haha, I guess I am. I knew pretty much right away that I would not be making it out of that situation alive. There were twelve of them, after all. But I think I did pretty well.\"\"You seem to have adapted to Nova Terra's light-hearted treatment of death quickly. Why do you think that is?\" Myst asked, jotting something down on her device.\"That is a great question, Myst.\" Thorn paused and watched for a reaction. Faced with Myst's impassive countenance, he sighed and continued. \"I had a good, long think about it. And, ultimately, it seemed a bit silly to care too much about it. Since death is impermanent, why not use it to your advantage?\"\"What do you mean by 'use it to your advantage'?\" \"Think about it. If the worst that is going to happen is that I'll have to spend twenty-four hours in Fantasia, then it is easy to weigh death against my objective. In this case, it was worth it to try my hand at killing the leader of my opponents. While I wasn't successful, I learned about my abilities, and I think that next time I will do better. Trading that knowledge for a day of rest seems like a pretty good deal to me.\"\"So you traded your death for understanding?\"\"It would be more accurate to say I traded a time-out for understanding. After all, I'm not dead, am I?\" Thorn smiled.\"Thank you for answering my questions, traveler. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, you will no longer meet me upon death. You will find the entrance to Fantasia behind you. Please enjoy your stay,\" Myst finished writing on her pad, giving Thorn an appraising look. With a small nod her figure faded into the air, leaving Thorn alone.The door to Fantasia was an oversized affair, just right for Thorn. \"Nice of them to take my height into consideration,\" Thorn thought as he walked through. As soon as his foot crossed the threshold, Thorn found himself in a futuristic city. He was currently joining a large crowd of others in exiting what looked, at first glance, to be a railway station.Overhead levitating cars and buses zipped by, stopping on platforms to let their occupants head into the floating bullet trains. Around him people rushed about their lives, not even sparing him a glance. At first, Thorn found it strange, until a dragon-headed individual brushed past him, jabbering away on his communications device while he tried to sip a scalding beverage.A closer look showed that the people around him were of all races and shapes and sizes, having brought their in-game race with them into Fantasia. Walking to the side of the road, Thorn gingerly sat down on a wall. After being sure that it would hold his weight, Thorn opened his menu and called his aunt. Rather than wander around Fantasia as he had when he first entered Nova Terra, he was looking forward to saying hi.\"Xavier. How are you, hun?\" Julia's excited face popped up on the screen. \"I'm well. Have I called at a bad time?\" Thorn asked, noticing the sheen of sweat on her face.\"No, no, this is great. I just finished my morning practice. Hold on one second.\" Taking a towel, Julia wiped her face and her neck. \"Ah, much better. So, what's new? Did you complete your quest?\"\"No, not yet.\" Thorn shook his head. \"I ran into some more people from Ragnarok and ended up dying. I'm in Fantasia now.\"\"Oh, again? Are you sure you don't want me to get the girls to pay them a visit?\"\"Yeah, really. I want to take care of it myself.\" Thorn's heart burst with warmth at his aunt's concern. \"I was hoping to meet up with you, if you are free.\"\"Of course. Why don't you meet me at our offices? I can show you around.\"Agreeing to meet up, Thorn pulled up the address that Julia sent him and walked over while looking around at the city. All of the traffic on the ground was either foot traffic or small scooter-like devices while the levitating cars flitted around between the tall buildings above everyone. Since he had entered the city, Thorn had seen almost nothing but skyscrapers, each uniquely designed. After twenty minutes of walking, Thorn reached the center of the business district. Despite housing almost half of the world's 11 billion people, Fantasia did not seem overly crowded. Where the five and a half billion people who used the city were, Thorn was not quite sure. According to what he had read, the city of Fantasia was almost another game in and of itself.Stopping, Thorn looked up. Rising over six hundred stories, the building in front of him was truly massive. At its base, it took up four city blocks, dwarfing all of the nearby buildings. A wide open walkway lead up to the huge glass entrance, exotic plants hanging from levitating planters. At the door stood uniformed greeters, welcoming the people streaming in off the street. As soon as Thorn stepped inside, a familiar figure made its way over. \"Welcome to Fantasia, Master Xavier.\" Henry, the head of Atlas' security team bowed his head slightly to Thorn.\"Hello, Henry. It is nice to see you again.\"\"Thank you, sir. If you'd come this way, we will take the private elevator up to see your aunt.\"Following Henry, Thorn could not stop looking around. The building was truly magnificent. A masterful neomodern structure, the smooth curves and quirky edges blended peace and energy. Thorn had seen pictures and even video walkthroughs of the Atlas headquarters, but he had to admit that being here in person was completely different.Standing comfortably in the elevator as it rapidly rose, Thorn could feel the care that his aunt gave him. One of the features of the massive buildings that sparked much attention when it had first been built was its scale. 'Scaled for a giant' some of the articles had said, unaware of how right they were.\"Xavier!\" As soon as the doors to the elevator opened, Thorn's aunt rushed in and gave him a big hug. \"I've missed you.\"\"Hi, Aunt Julia, I've missed you too.\"\"Come on in, I want to introduce you to some of the girls.\" Taking Thorn's large hand, she pulled him out of the elevator. \"We practice here when we are not in game. The facilities are better. Our practice room is state of the art. Oh, that reminds me. Before you go, set your home to this location. This floor and the two above it are the private residence. I hope you don't mind, but I have been letting the girls use it, since there are so many rooms.\"\"Of course I don't mind, you can use it however you want. It is your home, too.\"\"I know, I just feel bad because it is your building, and here I am making all the decisions about it.\" Walking through a wide doorway, Julia let go of Thorn and pointed to a large staircase on the right. \"Up that way is the living space. You'll find your room in there. You can set that as your login point for Fantasia and use it to get back to the game when your lockout is up. Come this way though, I want to introduce you.\"Julia led Thorn into a spacious lounge with comfortable-looking sofas spaced around a round fireplace in the center of the room. Three women in their late twenties or early thirties were sprawled out on the couches chatting quietly. As soon as they spotted Julia coming in, they rose and came to greet her. \"Xavier, let me introduce you to Esmire, Bluefire, and Odele. They are the Society of Roses' management staff. Esmire is our COO, Odele handles our PR, and Bluefire is in charge of combat and training. Girls, this is my nephew, Xavier. He just started playing a little while ago.\"---A few hours later, Thorn lay comfortably on his bed for the first time since he entered Nova Terra. Relaxing on the mattress that could easily fit a family of five, he put his hands behind his head and stared up at the aquarium overhead. Countless exotic fish swam through the water above him, yet they failed to catch his attention as Thorn's mind was drawn back to Nova Terra. After spending less than a month of real time in the game, Thorn could easily see why this alternate world had become so important. He could hardly wait for the 24-hour lockout period to be over so he could dive back in.But before he went back in, Thorn had something to do. With a deep breath, Thorn opened up his panel and stared at his messages. About to open the message from Mina, Thorn paused and looked around. His room was quiet and empty. \"Hmm, must just be my imagination,\" thought Thorn. The last few times he had been about to open up the message, something had interrupted him, making Thorn wonder if the game did not want him to open it.As Thorn had played Nova Terra, everything seemed to fall into place, allowing him to progress from one adventure to the next. Yet, despite the apparent randomness of everything that had happened to him, Thorn wondered if there was a guiding hand behind it. Fortifying himself, Thorn pressed the button. ", "Reading over it twice, conflicting emotions bubbled up in Thorn's chest. The message reopened the painful memory that the last four weeks had dulled. Still, it was not nearly as painful as it had been at first. At least now, Thorn felt like he could actually think about the situation clearly without being consumed with hurt and anger.Part of Thorn wanted revenge, wanted to crush them into pieces over and over again. But another part of Thorn remembered how much fun he had had with the group initially and longed to restore that relationship. Restless, Thorn looked at the timer. Still another ten hours before he could go back into Nova Terra. Getting up, he headed to the gym. Maybe moving would help him think.The workout room was an entire floor of the massive building and housed two pools, multiple tracks, an obstacle course, training dummies of all sorts, and a weight training area. Taken aback by how overwhelmingly huge it was, Thorn paused at the door. In the distance, he could see his aunt practicing with one of her guildmates on a large, square platform. If he was remembering correctly, she was named Bluefire.Wandering over to them, Thorn looked on in admiration at Julia's skillful use of her halberd. He had trained a bit in using a spear with his taijiquan master, but Julia's weapon was somewhat different. With a longer, wider blade, she could cut more effectively, creating a whirling storm of blades that served as an offense and defense at the same time. As he got closer, Thorn noticed that, despite her skill, she was still struggling against her opponent, Bluefire, who was armed with two tonfa. The silver weapons were fast and unpredictable while providing Bluefire with an impenetrable defense. The two women surged back and forth, sending slashes and strikes at each other without any regard for safety.Finally, Bluefire slipped through the silver net Julia was weaving and, flipping one of her tonfa around to increase her range, landed a solid strike on Julia's solar plexus, launching her backwards across the room. Seeing her hurt, Thorn was about to run to her when she threw down her weapon angrily and shouted, \"I concede.\" Instantly, her tired, sweaty figure was refreshed and she stood up, restored to a perfect state.\"Hey, Thorn, coming to train with us?\" Julia had seen her nephew come in, creating the slight gap that Bluefire had taken advantage of.\"I'm just checking everything out. I still have about ten hours, so I thought I'd work off some steam.\"\"You want to try sparring with Bluefire? She was just saying how she wanted to go for a couple rounds with you.\"\"I'd be happy to spar with you,\" affirmed Bluefire, tightening her blond hair into a ponytail. \"I don't know, I'm not super great at controlling myself yet.\" \"Oh, come on, give it a try. Bluefire is one of the best PvP players in the game. You're not going to hurt her. Plus, this room is special, it allows us to use our abilities and skills from Nova Terra. And, when we're done, it will heal everyone. Just like the sparring rings at the training halls.\"After a bit more prodding, Thorn finally stepped up onto the training ring. As soon as he did, he realized he could summon his weapons and armor again. A glance at Bluefire showed that she was not wearing any armor, so Thorn only summoned his tetsubo and got into his stance. Across from him, Bluefire bounced in place. Seeing that Thorn wasn't moving, she smiled and flexed her fingers.\"Watch out, I'm coming,\" Bluefire warned him. Accelerating suddenly, she dashed toward him, her body weaving unpredictably. Startled by her speed, Thorn swung his tetsubo in a long arc to try and force her back. Undeterred, Bluefire lowered her body until it was almost parallel with the ground and accelerated even faster, darting in under Thorn's swing and using the force of her dash to smash one of her tonfa into Thorn's side. Unable to respond in time, Thorn could only take the blow. Since he couldn't dodge, Thorn decided to aim for mutual destruction. Switching his grip on his tetsubo, Thorn struck back at Bluefire with the back of his hand. Though confident in her attack, Bluefire still raised her other tonfa to block Thorn's counterblow.Seeing the situation, an involuntary cry escaped Julia's lips. Yet the scene she had imagined never manifested itself. As the blow from Bluefire's tonfa impacted Thorn's side, his body barely shivered. Feeling her blow connect, Bluefire was horrified to realize that her impressive strength was not actually that impressive next to Thorn. The attack she hit him with was enough to send anyone else stumbling back, but Thorn simply grunted slightly.In fact, the rebound from the blow left her hand feeling numb, almost making her lose her grip on her weapon. Dumbfounded, she forgot to dodge Thorn's counterattack, taking it solidly on her tonfa. *crack*A loud sound echoed across the ring as the silver tonfa broke in half. Under Julia's stunned gaze, Bluefire broke apart into little lights, disappearing into the air. A blue light shot down from the ceiling to reveal Bluefire, as good as new, outside the ring. Impassive, Thorn put his weapon away and stepped down out of the ring, sighing mentally as Bluefire flinched back.\"Did...did you just die?\" Julia asked Bluefire, barely able to get the question out.\"Yes.\" Bluefire sighed, depressed about how quickly the fight had ended. \"But didn't you block?\"\"The force was overwhelming, activating a crushing blow.\" Eyeing Thorn contemplatively, Bluefire asked, \"What is your class, Xavier? My weapons give me significant damage reduction, but you smashed them like they were nothing.\"\"Actually, I don't have a class,\" admitted Thorn sheepishly. \"I'm just naturally strong.\"\"Naturally strong might be the understatement of the century. Naturally strong doesn't let you break a defensive weapon and one-shot a melee class. I mean, my defenses are not the best in the game, but common.\"\"Haha, I think you were so stunned that your attack did not do anything to him that you forgot to dodge.\" Julia laughed, remembering Bluefire's stunned face.\"Please, you would have been too. I hit him with everything I had, and he didn't even feel it.\" Bluefire stared accusingly at Thorn. \"I want another round.\"Five hours later, an exhausted Thorn threw himself down on the platform, causing it to shake. After constantly sparring for hour after hour, he was entirely spent and covered in bruises. While Bluefire had never been able to deal any real damage to him, every one of her strikes left Thorn aching. It had been hard to keep up with her speed, but Thorn found his reaction time getting better and better as they fought. Already quick for someone his size, Thorn found it easier to respond to Bluefire's sudden movements as they practiced together.Standing to the side, Julia waved her hand, and a white light fell on Thorn's giant figure, filling him with energy and healing his bruised body. She had always thought that Thorn would do well in Nova Terra, but the last five hours had completely upended her view of the game. Thorn was like a mountain, entirely immovable. Against a blunt weapon like Bluefire's, Thorn was practically invulnerable.\"With good enough armor, he would be invulnerable against bladed weapons, too,\" Bluefire said, seeming like she was able to read Julia's thoughts. \"If he had a bit more training and experience, he very well could be the most dangerous melee fighter in the game. Even without a class. I just can't get over how solid he is.\"\"How are you feeling, Xavier?\" Julia asked as Thorn rose to his feet.\"I'm feeling pretty good. It is convenient that the system can reset us so we don't have to wait for the bruises to heal. Plus, I feel like I am getting a better grasp on how actual combat works. So far I have done a lot of brawling, but all of my fights end quickly, so it is hard to actually practice.\"\"Well, I think you are just fine.\" Bluefire tucked a strand of her hair behind her ear. \"You have the most ridiculous advantage in strength, reach, and stability. You just need to practice anticipating your opponent's movements. Even though I couldn't do anything to you, remember that I am one of the better melee combatants in the game. Most other people are not as quick as I am.\"\"Hah, listen to her.\" Julia rolled her eyes. \"You just spent five hours attacking him without dealing any real damage.\"\"What, you want to give it a try?\" Bluefire sneered. \"I bet you wouldn't last more than ten seconds.\"\"Actually, I was wondering, is there a place to train against abilities? Or magic?\" Thorn asked. \"I ran across some players who had some pretty crazy abilities. I don't know if I would have any chance against them.\"\"Sure, let's give it a try. Bluefire, do you want the first round?\" Julia asked, looking at her blonde friend.\"Yeah, why not? Maybe I can get some of my honor back,\" Bluefire joked, stepping onto the platform and readying her tonfa again. With a low shout, she summoned a blue flame that covered her weapons. \"Watch out, big guy, these things are dangerous,\" she warned Thorn, waving her flame covered weapons.The mystical fire dancing along the edge of the tonfas radiated a dangerous feeling, so he readied himself, watching them carefully. Bouncing lightly on the balls of her feet, Bluefire tapped her weapons together rhythmically before suddenly dashing forward. Each footstep left a burning imprint in the ring's floor as she moved forward inhumanly fast. Within half a second, she was right in front of Thorn, a strike flying directly at him. Startled by her increase in speed, Thorn fell back half a step, raising his weapon to block. With a loud clang, the weapons impacted one another, and the two players bounced apart. His hand numb from the force of the blow, Thorn estimated that the mystical flames had tripled Bluefire's attack speed and doubled her strength.Under his watchful gaze, Bluefire chanted some arcane words, causing the fire that flickered along the edges of her weapons to burst out, forming blades that extended almost two feet beyond her hands. Warning bells started ringing in Thorn's head as he looked at the flickering blades.\"Those look dangerous,\" Thorn blurted out, as Bluefire began to bounce again.\"You have no idea.\" Julia smirked at Thorn's nervous tone.Completely focused, Bluefire sprinted forward again, her blades slashing out with ever increasing speed and ferocity. As he warded off the first few blows, Thorn felt that the attack was manageable, but that quickly changed. The attacks came in faster and faster, causing Thorn to retreat. Every time he successfully blocked an attack, a chunk of his weapon would fly off, carved out by the mystic blades. Fed up with his passive position, Thorn gritted his teeth and struck out, ignoring a stab coming toward his side. Her eyes flickering, Bluefire abandoned one of her strikes to deflect Thorn's counter attack while her other blade continued toward his chest. Feeling her blade bite into Thorn, Bluefire smiled in triumph. Once her blade connected, it was over. Yet the fight failed to follow her predictions as Thorn's counter attack continued toward her, despite the growing stab wound in his side.The moment his attack approached her weapon, she knew she was in trouble. Before it even connected, she could feel the compressed air from the tetsubo pushing her back. \"If that hits, I'm dead,\" Bluefire thought. Decisively abandoning her attack, she yelled out an arcane command and disappeared in a flash of flame, reappearing a moment later twenty feet away.Losing his target, Thorn stumbled to the ground, falling to one knee. The flame blade that hit his side had cut deep and the blue flames continued to lick at him. Grimacing, Thorn clapped a hand over the wound as he stood to his feet. Despite patting the burning area a couple of times, Thorn found that the flames did not go out, instead continuing to burn painfully.\"Poison Flame doesn't stop burning unless you get magical healing,\" Bluefire remarked as she watched Thorn try to put the flame out. \"Huh, really? That is pretty cool. Do they go out if you are defeated?\"\"Um, yeah. I guess. They go out if I unsummon my blades. But how are you still standing? Most people who get hit with them are rolling on the ground within seconds.\"\"Really?\" Thorn looked at Julia, who was doing nothing to conceal her utter amazement. \"It's just a stinging feeling. Sort of like a hot electrical shock. I mean, it hurts, but it is manageable.\"\"Ah. Forget it.\" Bluefire shook her head in defeat, unsummoning her blades. \"I don't want to fight anymore. You're absolutely ridiculous. A total cheat. This is so unfair.\"\"Haha,\" Julia laughed happily as she waved her hand, restoring both of the combatants to peak form. \"Isn't he amazing? Xavier, I knew that Nova Terra would suit you. Not everyone can force Bluefire to put her blades away.\"\"Hmph. I could have won, it just would have taken a bit,\" Bluefire grumbled.\"Thank you very much for sparring with me.\" Thorn clasped his fists in a traditional martial arts salute, bowing his head slightly toward the complaining lady. \"It is very helpful for me to face such skilled opponents.\"\"No problem, Xavier. I noticed that you were surprised when you saw my blades. Have you not had much experience with magic?\"\"I haven't. I've seen people use it, but I have not really fought against it before.\"\"Well, why don't we change that?\" Bluefire turned to Julia, \"Xavier still has a few hours before he can go back into Nova Terra. Why don't we call Odele and Jasmine so he can get some practice in? It would be good for them too; they have been getting pretty lazy recently.\"\"That is a great idea! Thorn, Odele and Jas are two of our best casters. I'll call them over, and they can give you a rundown on how to fight against a caster as a melee combatant. Though you better get some armor on, their attacks pack a serious punch.\" Julia pulled up her messaging interface as she spoke, sending a quick text.Excited, Thorn equipped his armor as he waited. He had been feeling a bit depressed about his loss to the group at Embersplit Mine. Taking a deep breath as two women walked into the gym, Thorn greeted them and got into his stance. A deep excitement burned in his chest. He had never felt more alive.", "An armored guard leaning casually against the wall of the temple nearly jumped out of his skin when Thorn's massive figure appeared right in front of him. After a few hours of practice against the two mages from the Society of Roses, Thorn felt like he had a much better idea of how to fight against a magic user. In fact, that knowledge was carved deep into his skin. He had been burned, frozen, shocked, and impaled over the course of the fight, each spell giving him a painful reminder of what he should have done.The fight had evened out slightly when, in a moment of frustration at his inability to close the distance, he had pulled out his large arbalest and dispatched one of his opponents with a massive bolt. He had still lost that fight, quite brutally in fact, but he felt as if he was on the edge of figuring out how to deal with casters. The repeated losses had taught him quickly that his body was largely impervious to damage due to its density and overwhelming strength and stamina, a trait that only increased as he added armor. However, direct blows to his head or neck were just as deadly to him as they were to other players. While he could certainly take more damage than the average player, he still had the same weak points. This explained why he had fallen so fast at the mine. The female swordswoman had targeted the back of his neck, paralyzing him before finishing him off. Thorn had been so engrossed with crushing the red magical shield that he hadn't bothered to protect his neck. While armor could help with some of that, Thorn had no desire to cover himself completely in metal, since that would further reduce his already low mobility. Additionally, while his blunt force damage was high, excessive even, the repeated fights against the ladies from the Society of Roses demonstrated the value of piercing force over and over again. Every time he died, it was because of some magical damage that ripped straight through his defenses. Thorn did have his immense strength on his side, often allowing him to trigger a [Crushing Blow], but that did not help against magical defense that negated all the force, or at least, cut it down significantly.Bluefire's magical blades had been especially eye-opening. She used them for both defense and offense simultaneously, combining blunt force with sharp, piercing damage to great effect. The more Thorn thought about it, the more he realized that this was what Master Sun had been trying to get him to achieve. Combined offense and defense that flowed into each other without warning. In hand-to-hand combat, Thorn was arguably unbeatable. His excellent taijiquan training, combined with his inhuman strength and weight, made it almost impossible for him to lose. At melee weapon range, his training with Master Sun and his impressive force was enough to give most fighters fits. Even his long range combat abilities were higher than average due to the raw damage his City Defender arbalest granted him. However, once magic entered the equation, all of this went out the window. No matter how tough he was, he couldn't block a chaos bolt, or avoid the slowing effect of an ice arrow. No matter how strong he was, he couldn't punch his way through an invulnerability bubble. Just like the fight against the spirits in Hati's Ascent, magic needed to be fought with magic. Rather than discouragement, Thorn felt renewed energy after losing to the Society of Roses mages. After all, it gave him something to work toward.Nodding casually and tossing two silver to the gaping guard, Thorn sauntered off toward the inn where he was going to meet Oberlin. He had re-spawned in Embersplit since it was the last town he had been through before his run-in with the players at the mine had gotten him killed. He had just stepped out of the temple courtyard when he saw three familiar red-armored players standing in the middle of the street.\"There he is, Boss. I told you he would log in.\" The female warrior who had killed Thorn pointed a well-manicured finger at him.\"I can see that, Telis.\" The handsome man in red armor narrowed his eyes as he glared at Thorn's massive figure. Planting himself in Thorn's way, he rested his hand on his sword. Having started a fight in a town before and paid the significant cost, the gesture almost caused Thorn to laugh out loud. Thankfully for the red-armored man's blood pressure, Thorn was able to stifle the chuckle, turning it into a cough.\"Hello, nice to see you again.\" Thorn smiled down at the three players blocking him. Seeing that they were not about to move, he stopped. \"What can I do for you?\"\"What did you do with our boxes?\" The red-armored warrior Thorn had nearly killed in the fight at the mine stepped in front of his boss and pointed at Thorn's chest.\"Sorry? I'm not sure what you are talking about.\" Thorn raised his eyebrows as he stared at the finger.\"Korith, stand down,\" the handsome man called the warrior back. \"I think we might have started off on the wrong foot. My name is Angdrin, Ragnarok's fourth seat. I lost something during our scuffle last night that is important to me, and I want it back.\"\"Nice to meet you, Angdrin. My name is Thorn, and believe it or not, I have no idea what you are talking about.\"\"Hmph. I hope, for your sake, that is actually the case. If I find out otherwise, you will suffer for it.\"\"Oh yeah?\" Annoyed at the threat, Thorn stepped forward until he was almost on top of Korith, his eyes hard. Reaching out a huge hand, Thorn picked Korith up and put him to the side without any visible effort. Staring down at Angdrin, Thorn smiled. \"It has yet to be decided who is going to suffer. We still have to settle our fight from before.\"Shocked by Thorn's aggressive move, Angdrin stepped back quickly before he could stop himself. Realizing that he had just backed down, he flushed slightly, the anger in his eyes growing.\"Hmph. Watch yourself,\" Angdrin spat before turning and leaving, Korith and Telis trailing behind him. He could not start a fight in the center of town, and from the look in Thorn's eyes, he really had no idea what this exchange was about. Frustrated, Angdrin could only lead his followers away.Watching them go, Thorn had a contemplative look on his face. Oberlin had not mentioned anything regarding this, only telling Thorn to meet him at the Green Goblin when he logged back in. Despite his silence, Thorn was pretty positive that Oberlin had something to do with the missing items.The Green Goblin was just as small and rickety as it had been the first time Thorn had visited, so he did not dare squeeze in. Waiting for Oberlin to come out of the inn, Thorn thought about the encounter he had just had with Angdrin. He had mentioned something about being one of Ragnarok's seats, but Thorn did not know what that meant. Was it some sort of leadership position? Like a council? Resolving to ask Oberlin, Thorn's thoughts drifted to Mina's message.According to what she wrote, the party had broken up after Ouroboros got the Exalted Devil Blood Berserker class due to the mixed feelings over their actions. Thorn still did not know how he felt about trying to restore his relationship with Mina and Velin. Part of him was revolted by the idea, but another part of him longed to go back to those fun, hopeful days before he was tossed aside.As he was musing on these things, a commotion in the inn caught his attention. Shouts, the sound of things breaking, and a flurry of voices drifted out of the inn's doors. Concerned, Thorn crouched down and stuck his head inside the door gingerly. The inside of the inn was just as sketchy looking as the outside, and Thorn's gaze quickly settled on a large group of players surrounding Oberlin's thin figure. At first, no one noticed Thorn, but he coughed loudly, catching a few of the players' eyes. Shocked, they nudged their neighbors, and soon silence fell as the patrons stared at the giant head poking through the doorway. \"Oberlin, are you coming?\"\"Yes.\" Like a slippery fish, Oberlin wiggled his way through the crowd and made it to Thorn's side. \"Let's go.\" At first, Oberlin tried to squeeze out before Thorn pulled his head out of the doorway. Getting halfway out, he realized that Thorn's body was completely blocking the door. After some awkward shuffling, Thorn managed to back out and stand up without knocking against the inn. Seeing Oberlin's curious gaze, Thorn explained that he was worried about knocking the building over.\"Haha, you have to worry about the weirdest things. Still, it would serve them right,\" Oberlin remarked. \"They tried to scam me out of three gold! Can you imagine? The nerve of some people!\" As he spoke, he hurried Thorn along.\"Oh yeah? And how much did you swipe on your way through the crowd just now?\"\"Hmm? 6 gold, 54 Silver, and 19 copper,\" Oberlin said proudly, patting his belt pouch. \"You make a great distraction. I'm telling you, we should work together. We could be the best heist duo Nova Terra has ever seen.\"\"Speaking of swiping things, I met that red-armored man again today. Angdrin was his name. He mentioned that he was missing something. Do you happen to know anything about that?\" After arriving at the edge of town, Thorn led the way toward Embersplit Mine. \"Yeah, while you were being your normal, distracting self, I swiped a couple crates that had fallen out of the carriage you threw.\"\"What do they hold?\" Thorn asked, looking intently at Oberlin.Looking around to make sure there was no one nearby, Oberlin pulled out a crate and set it on the ground.  Opening it slightly, Thorn could see an ornate box inside the crate. Magical runes, etched along the top and sides, pulsed weakly. His brow furrowed, Thorn looked at Oberlin, who shook his head.\"I haven't had time to open them. It will probably take me a couple hours to crack the magic lock, and maybe half that for the mechanical lock on the box. I need an absolutely quiet environment. There are six boxes, so we are talking at least a day.\"\"They look expensive.\" \"Expensive? They are potentially priceless. I don't recognize the runes at all, which means they are not from the second or third era. If they are from the first era, then we've got a huge time bomb on our hands.\"\"Time bomb?\"\"Let's leave that for later.\" The thief's face turned serious. \"What are your plans after this?\"Thorn stared at Oberlin quietly for a moment. The thief was rarely so serious, so Thorn knew that the content of the boxes was a big deal. After a little consideration, Thorn nodded and continued toward the mine.\"I want to wrap up this quest and then head back to Berum. I need to find a place called Greymane Castle, so I was planning on doing some research there. I've already gotten a map of this region, and it doesn't look like the castle is nearby.\"\"What are the chances you want to help me with something?\" Oberlin looked at Thorn hopefully.\"I told you, I don't want to get involved in anything illegal. I've had enough of prison.\"\"And I'm telling you, it is not illegal! I just need backup when I'm talking to a couple of people.\"\"Tell me about it later, and we'll see. For now, I'm going to deal with Supervisor Hobson.\" Having arrived at the gate to the mine compound, Thorn strode in. For a brief moment, the gate guard considered stopping him, but that idea was quickly shelved when the guard saw Thorn's determined face.\"Where is the Supervisor?\"\"Uh...Super...Supervisor Hobson is...he is in his of...office.\"\"Thanks.\" As Thorn walked toward the mine office, his eye caught a flicker of movement in one of the windows. Smiling grimly to himself, Thorn did not bother knocking. Two steps brought him to the desk where he stared down at the cowering supervisor. \"Wh...What do you want?\" Supervisor Hobson stammered nervously, his hands clenching his armrests.\"I was sent here to fix a problem, and it is time to do exactly that. Your mine is not producing the required amount of Ember Iron ore, I need to know that you plan on fixing that within the next two weeks, or I will have to take drastic action.\"\"B...but.\"\"No buts. There are only two options. First, you increase your production of Ember Iron. Or, second, you inform your superiors that you found an ancient ruin at the bottom of the mine. Those are the only two paths you can take. Well, there is a third one where I get involved, but I don't think you would like how that ends up.\"\"Huh? How did you know?\" Horrified, Supervisor Hobson recoiled further in his seat.\"It doesn't matter how I knew. What matters is what you are going to do about it?\"\"But if I tell anyone, those red-armored players are going to kill me!\"\"You don't need to worry about them,\" Oberlin cut in, sitting on Supervisor Hobson's desk. \"A mine supervisor will be the last of their worries. Look, you don't even have to tell your boss that you pulled a bunch of chests out of the ruin.\"At Oberlin's words, Hobson's face drained, and he slumped down in his chair, defeated.\"Alright, what do you want me to do?\"\"Simple, just tell the mine owners that you found the ruin. Chances are they will be way too busy with that to worry about you. In fact, if you play it right, you may be able to keep your position here. Chances are, this will be turned into a dungeon launch point. Who knows, you might even end up running the dungeon.\"Listening to Oberlin convincing the supervisor, Thorn's brow furrowed. Somehow, this ending did not sit well with him. After a moment of thought, he interrupted the other two, asking, \"What happened to Margo Talern?\" \"Ah, poor Margo.\" Supervisor Hobson shook his head. \"He was actually the one who found the ruin. He had discovered it about a week before he died. He sold the information to that guild, Ragnarok, who dispatched that group to explore the mine. Margo got greedy and tried to extort their leader, who killed him off without batting an eye. After that, we could only cooperate. We pulled a bunch of stuff out of the ruin, hiding it under the Ember Iron ore. At night we would load it up into a carriage and send it along with a couple guards.\"\"You should not have any trouble reporting this to the mine owners.\" Thorn fixed Supervisor Hobson with an intense gaze. \"Now tell me about the chests you loaded last night.\"\u00a0", "Supervisor Hobson took Thorn and Oberlin's advice and contacted the owner of the mine to inform them that they had broken into a ruin deep in the mine. At first, Thorn had a bit of interest in seeing what was in the ruin, but he quickly dismissed that idea when he looked at the size of the tunnels. So far, Thorn had been really lucky that all of the underground spaces he had gone into had been able to accommodate his size.That was not the case at Embersplit mine. The tunnels were small to the point that even Oberlin had to squeeze through as he explored. Oberlin had gone down with Supervisor Hobson to look at the ruin, and when he came back and told Thorn that it looked like an old dwarven ruin, any motivation Thorn had felt went right out the window.Within a day, the mine owner, who happened to be the local Count, sent soldiers, workers, and more miners to try and open up the path to the ruin. Just as Oberlin predicted, the count immediately had his men build a large number of buildings around the entrance to the mine, changing the sign board to read [Embersplit Ruin]. Annoyed by the constant banging and yelling, Thorn left the mine entrance and walked to the edge of the nearby forest to watch the frantic workers. He had not been sitting for more than two minutes when a young boy ran up to him. \"Sir traveler, the Lieutenant would like to see you.\" The kid stared at Thorn in undisguised awe.\"Alright.\" Thorn rose to his feet. \"Can you show me the way?\"A makeshift canopy had been slung just inside the gate of the compound to provide shade for a table covered in papers and blueprints. Standing behind it, a harassed looking military officer was barking orders at the various scribes, soldiers, and workers rushing past. Supervisor Hobson, as nervous as usual, hovered nearby. Seeing Thorn walk up, the Lieutenant threw down the paper in his hand. \"Hello, traveler. The supervisor tells me that you were instrumental in driving off the bandits that came to attack the mine compound. Do you think you could help me identify them? The Count is not pleased at the idea that someone was foolish enough to try and rob him.\"\"Of course, Lieutenant.\"\"Ah, sorry for my breach of manners. My name is Tormand Tyeful, First Lieutenant of the Third Corps. I've been assigned from the Imperial Army to help the Count.\"\"Thorn.\" Gently taking the offered hand, Thorn shook it as lightly as he could. \"Identifying the culprits will be simple. They wore a very distinct red leather armor with the symbol of the guild Ragnarok. Their leader is named Angdrin, and his two main henchmen are Korith and Telis.\"\"Oh, is that right?\" Lieutenant Tyeful seemed to deflate, the aggression bleeding right out of him. \"Well, maybe it is not so important, after all. Ragnarok is not a group to be taken lightly, and certainly not a group that the Count will be interested in pursuing. Anyway, why don't we put that aside? Do you have any interest in helping us? We are still transporting material in and could use all the man-power available. The job is paid.\"\"Sure.\"Two days later, Thorn stood outside the gate of the mine compound. Taking a deep breath of the sweet night air, he looked at the notification that had just popped up a few moments ago. Finally free of the [Criminal] title, Thorn's abilities were back to one hundred percent, and his titles were all active. Happy to be back to normal, Thorn pulled up his status. Still classless, Thorn was not in a hurry to pick one up. His recent fights had shown him that he was proficient enough in combat to at least hold his own. While he was not unbeatable, anyone who wanted a piece of him was definitely going to suffer. Not that he would turn down a good class if it came along, but finding a class was not his priority. After thinking for a moment, Thorn selected his [Lord Greymane, the Moon Wolf] title. Avatar of Hati, Lord Greymane. While Thorn had not figured out the full significance of these titles, he had the feeling that his path in Nova Terra would revolve heavily around them. In order to fully unlock the combined title, he had to retake Greymane Keep. Which meant, first and foremost, he had to find the keep.After getting the map of the region, Thorn had scoured it to try and locate Greymane Keep, but no luck. In frustration, he had almost called Velin, but had stopped, since their relationship was tenuous at the moment. Still, he had been slowly leaning toward contacting Mina, and this would be a good excuse. One of the main reasons Thorn had hesitated to reply to Mina was the anticipated awkwardness. Truthfully, he did not have any idea what to say. Sighing to himself, Thorn bemoaned his lack of experience with relationships. Thorn had known a good number of people, though most of them were employees of his or his aunt. That left him woefully short of experience dealing with disagreements and conflict, particularly with regular people.He had read some books on conflict as part of his education, but nothing had prepared him for the emotional and mental turmoil that interpersonal conflict actually caused. Should he just pretend that nothing had happened? That seemed disingenuous. After all, Mina and Velin had both participated in Ouroboros' plan. In fact, Velin might have even helped plan it. But what was the point of trying to get back at them? Mina was obviously trying to restore the relationship on some level, so responding angrily would undermine that effort, creating an ever bigger rift. Thorn sighed again. Relationships were so complicated. Opening up the message, Thorn read through it again, before hitting the button to reply.Staring at the form for a long time, Thorn eventually just entered a couple simple sentences and hit the send button.  Rather than worrying about what was going to happen, or what could happen, or what the result would be, Thorn figured he could just take it slow and see where things ended up. Mentally, he had written off those relationships weeks ago, so if they never improved, it wouldn't be too much of a bother. Still, there was part of him that longed for a better resolution to the situation.\"It is all so complicated.\" Thorn mused to himself as he glanced back at the mine where Oberlin had just finished talking to the gate guard.\"So, what now?\" Oberlin walked up to Thorn, his hand patting his belt pouch. \"Next thing on my agenda is to head back to Berum. From there I need to find a place called Greymane Keep.\"\"Huh, I've never heard of it.\" Oberlin looked around at the quiet forest. Thorn could tell from his fidgeting that the thief had something to ask but did not know how to broach the subject.\"If there is something you need, just spit it out, Oberlin.\" Thorn's tone was even.\"Look, I know you have turned me down a bunch of times, but I really need your help,\" Oberlin pleaded, clenching his fists tightly and taking a deep breath. \"A while ago I fell in with a really bad crowd, and they will not let me go. You are the only person I know who might be able to do something about them.\"\"You want me to kill them?\"\"What? No, no. Do I look like someone who would ask you to kill people?!\"\"Yes.\"\"I mean, if you wanted to, I wouldn't stop you.\" Seeing Thorn's frown, Oberlin waved his hands and changed tactics. \"Look, that isn't what I am asking for. I just need someone big and threatening who can help me have a reasonable conversation with them. You fit both the requirements, and most importantly, I know you are not going to sell me out.\"\"Where are they?\"\"They have contact points all over the place. The nearest is a small town called Vermin. It is south east of here.\"\"Vermin? Like, rats?\"\"Yup. It is one of the red towns. Wait, don't tell me you don't know what a red town is?\" Oberlin shook his head at Thorn's blank stare. \"Sometimes I wonder if you grew up under a rock. Players in old MMOs used to get red names if they killed other players. A red named player could be killed by other players without penalty, and it also meant that the guards would attack them on sight. Players with red names either had to wait for a certain amount of time so their name would fade or go to specially designated towns where criminals and player killers were welcome.\"Nova Terra is way more nuanced than that, so it does not use the whole red name thing. But the concept of towns specifically for criminals has carried over. Vermin is, as you can imagine from the name, one of those towns. No matter how bad your record, you can still get services in the town. People buy and sell stolen goods, set up bounties and gangs, and just generally do whatever they want.\"As you can imagine, it is not an environment conducive to one's health. Especially for a thief like me. I'd feel a lot better about going if you came along. Plus, once I am out from under these guys, I can come with you and help you with your quest. You know, finding that castle and doing whatever you need.\" Oberlin's hopeful face was almost enough to make Thorn agree on the spot but, taking a deep breath, he suppressed the feeling. The last time he helped out with a another person's quest, it had ended poorly.\"What are you not telling me? There is no way it is as simple as walking in and telling them that you are no longer working for them. If it was, you would have done it already and would not need me.\" Just as Oberlin was about to rush to explain himself, Thorn held up a hand. \"Think this through. You only have one chance to explain.\"Lapsing into silence, Oberlin bit one of his fingers. It was quickly becoming obvious to him that Thorn was not as naive as he looked. Thorn did not rush the thief, just watched calmly as he paced back and forth.\"Okay, fine. I'll spill the whole thing. I signed a contract with a specific secret society to provide intelligence. You know about Avalon, right? Just like them, except secret. I thought I was signing on to give them market prices and other economic information, but over the last year, the focus of the information they are asking me to gather has shifted into more serious stuff. Military intelligence and other things like that. I did not like the way the relationship was headed, so I decided to leave. Unfortunately, they did not take kindly to my intentions, and I've been hiding ever since.\"The situation is further complicated by the type of contract I signed. Instead of a paper contract, I had to drip some blood on a statue, and now I'm plagued every night with terrible nightmares that sap my willpower. I think they are trying to control me. My quest says that I need to break the statue in order to reclaim my soul. A bit melodramatic, I know, but that's how quests work. I was in a really desperate place when I agreed to join them, and if I don't find a way to break the statue, I'll never be free. I have a plan for getting the statue away from them, but I don't have the confidence to do it myself. With you there, my chances of success increase quite a bit.\"\"So you want me to upset a powerful secret society so you can sleep well at night?\" Thorn asked, his gaze heavy.\"No, look. I mean, yes. But it is more than that. You would also be doing a great service for the empire since I am almost positive that the organization comes from the south. The far south.\"\"Demonkin?\"\"Yes. From the research I've done, their methods are the same as the spirit magic that Demonkin use. I don't have direct confirmation of that, since my main point of contact is human, but I am 90% sure that the organization is based out of the Southern continent. Most of the information they were after was pertaining to military matters along the border.\"\"All the more reason for me to stay out of it, right?\"\"No, you don't get it. Your quest is to become the lord of some castle, right? Greymane Keep? That means that as soon as a war starts, you'll be dragged in. The situation has been escalating by the day, and with the Demonkin side digging for military secrets, war is inevitable. One of the requirements of being a lord is supporting the Empire when wars start, so there is next to no chance that you will not be part of the conflict. Not only is this a great chance to strike a preemptive blow against your eventual enemies, but you will be helping me out.\"Look, not only am I willing to help you with your quests once I'm free, but I'll give you the six chests we took from Ragnarok and help you open them. Each chest is worth a fortune. If that is not enough, just tell me, and I'll think of a way to make it work.\"Watching Oberlin plead with him, Thorn's heart was moved. It was obvious how much the thief valued freedom, a feeling that Thorn was in tune with. His main motivation for playing Nova Terra was freedom, so seeing Oberlin in this situation sparked Thorn's sympathy. Plus, if what Oberlin was saying was true, it was highly likely that war was on his horizon. Even Thorn's aunt had mentioned the increased activity near the capital during one of their casual conversations.\"The six chests, opening them, and everything you know about the organization,\" Thorn stated his terms.\"Are you serious?!\" Oberlin looked up, excitement plain on his face. \"Of course. Thank you!\"\"Let's talk about your plan as we move. The sooner we get there, the sooner we are done.", "A wretched hive of scum and villainy, at least, that is how the forums described the town of Vermin. A decaying slum or cramped, dirty, squatter's camp would undoubtedly be the terms most would use to categorize the sight in front of Thorn. The town was a tangled mess of buildings, linked together with no semblance of order. The lack of unified planning had led to a rotting maze of streets, many simply ending where someone decided to put up a building.The closer Thorn and Oberlin got to Vermin, the more visibly agitated Oberlin became. Seeing Thorn's concerned look, the thief smiled wanly as they stood on a ridge overlooking the town. \"See that one story building? The one on the edge of town there?\" Oberlin pointed at a small shack on the western side of the town. \"That is the entrance to the shrine. For this plan to work, I need to get in there. But there is no way to get passed, the guards so I need you to create a distraction.\" \"Your plan is to have me create a ruckus in the middle of town, and then you will go in to steal the statue?\"\"Pretty much. It is simple, but it should work. You're big enough to create a ruckus, and I'm good enough to get in and out quickly.\"\"That seems a lot like stealing.\"\"Are you serious? Why are you so worried about this? It is the same as looting a mob!\" Oberlin half yelled at Thorn.\"Hey, calm down. It's not like I won't help, I just think your plan is silly.\" Thorn remained unperturbed in the face of Oberlin's outburst. \"First, if I make a scene in the middle of town, I'll attract way too many people's attention, which is a good way for me to get killed. Plus, what are the chances that the guards in the shrine will leave? Pretty much zero.\"Second, if you could have snuck in, you would have done it already. That tells me that you are not nearly as confident as you are letting on. I'm guessing that is because they have some means of detecting your stealth or determining your location. Chances are, whatever is letting you identify where the statue is acts as a two-way tether. This means it is almost impossible that they are not expecting you, making it even more unlikely that the guards will leave the shrine.\"Third, from what you said, the statue is not going to be easily accessible, which means your plan is probably to destroy it on location, since you can't steal it away. But doing that will alert the guards, making it unlikely for you to escape. Yeah, you could just die, but you have not embarked on a suicide mission previously, which means there is something keeping you from doing it. Do I need to keep going?\"\"No.\" Sighing, and shaking his head, Oberlin shared a quest screen with Thorn. \"You know, you are way smarter than you look. I mean, it isn't like you look stupid per se, but no one expects critical thinking out of someone with the constitution of an elephant. The reason I am so concerned about this is that I cannot die before completing the quest.\"\"See,\" Thorn smiled widely, \"you should have just started from here. This is a class upgrade quest? Interesting, I've never seen one before. Okay, why don't you start at the beginning?\"\"Fine. You might want to sit down.\" Oberlin crouched, his eyes never leaving the town. \"When I first entered the game, I thought I would get a clean break from my real life. I had money, nothing drastic, but enough to live comfortably while I played Nova Terra full time. I was hoping for a change of pace, something different. Unfortunately, life had other plans, and the first four classes I picked did not work out. I dabbled as a caster for a while and then switched to an agility-based fighter. I even tried being a chef after I realized I was unsuited for combat, and when that was too boring, I fell back on my old real-life profession, thi...er...Locksmith.\"I had no desire to ever get into that again. I mean, I started playing Nova Terra to get away from my past. But it is the only thing I know, and I am good at it, really good at it. Good to the point that it took me less than a month to master the class and upgrade to Master Locksmith. I scraped out a living in the capital city opening locks for other players. All legal stuff. You know, chests and dungeons and stuff like that.\"Everything was fine, if a bit boring, when one day, one of my customers brought in a box for me to open. That was pretty normal, but the box ended up being cursed. To make a long, complicated story short, in order to remove the curse, I pledged myself to serve the Ordo Serpentes. That is the group we are about to go up against. I thought they were a group that dealt in intelligence, like the Children of Avalon, but it turned out that they are an offshoot of the Demonkin Empire's intelligence bureau.\"The bit of my soul they extracted was the part that carried the curse, but they soon started giving me outrageous requests, so I have been on the run from them for almost a year now. You were right about the statue though. As long as we are within a certain distance, the statue can sense my general location, and vice-versa. I am sick and tired of being chased around, and even though my combat strength is zero, I have to try this.\"\"But it is not all bad, right?\" Thorn patted the downcast thief on the shoulder lightly. \"You have a quest for a triple class upgrade, right? And it is a natural upgrade, so it is even stronger than an Ancient Inheritance, right?\"\"Sure, but I have to live to enjoy it.\"\"No problem. Come on, let's go.\" Standing and brushing his pants off, Thorn set off down the hill, his long strides carrying him down quickly.\"Wait, what about our plan?\" Oberlin scrambled to his feet and ran after him.\"First, we'll go talk to them. Then we'll break the statue. Last, we'll leave. I've got to get to Berum to meet someone and then find this castle.\"\"Are you crazy? We are just walking right in? Does that even work? Don't I have to sneak in for the quest?\"\"Why would you have to sneak in?\"\"The quest says I have to steal my soul back.\"\"There are lots of ways to steal stuff.\" Thorn stopped and looked at Oberlin squarely. \"Every lock has a key, and all the keys are different. You wouldn't try and open every lock with the same approach, why would you assume that your quest has one approach? Genghis Khan stole lots of stuff, and he never snuck anywhere.\"\"So we're going to burn the place to the ground, after murdering everyone in the town?\"\"Okay, so it was a bad comparison.\" Thorn rolled his eyes and continued walking. \"My point is that you are too caught up in your identity as a thief. I'm assuming that has something to do with your past, but you do not have to live your life that way. Just because you did that in the past, doesn't mean you have to do that now. Right now, in this moment, you are a locksmith, a great locksmith. And it just so happens that you found the right key for this situation. Me.\"Stunned, Oberlin could only stare at Thorn's back as he walked confidently into town. Vermin was occupied by players and natives who lived on the wrong side of the law. Murder and theft were common here, and the law of the jungle was in full effect.  When Thorn and Oberlin first appeared on the edge of town, many eyes turned toward them. After all, fresh meat was rare in Vermin.Yet, those same eyes quickly went back to their own business after seeing Thorn's size and massive weapon. Most of the players here made their living preying on their fellow man, but as cruel as they were, few of them were stupid. Thorn's confident stride, his shining armor, the large tetsubo resting on his shoulder, and the glinting claws on his fingers all combined with his excessive height to intimidate the fight right out of the townsfolk.Parting like water in front of him, the crowds hurried to the side, allowing Thorn to walk through the maze of streets to the building that Oberlin had pointed out. While it did not look like much on the surface, Oberlin had explained that it was only the entrance to an underground temple compound. Seeing no guards, Thorn pushed open the door and ducked inside.The whole building was a single room, empty except for a small shrine and a priest in a shimmering green, scaled robe, who was meditating to the side, his eyes closed. Thorn looked at Oberlin, who stepped into the building behind him. \"Entrance is under the shrine,\" Oberlin whispered. \"If we are really negotiating, we need to talk to the High Priest.\"\"Excuse me. I'd like to talk to the High Priest.\" Thorn walked confidently up to the priest and looked down at him.\"The High Priest doesn't see...Uh...okay.\" Halfway through his refusal, the priest opened his eyes and immediately thought better of it. \"Let me ask if he is available.\"\"Thanks.\" Thorn smiled widely, turning to Oberlin. \"See, sometimes you just need to ask.\"\"And be twice their height.\"\"Sure, that can help.\"\"Um, sir? The High Priest will see you. Please wait while I open the passage. You'll want to head down the hall and take your first right.\" The priest was very respectful as he pushed a button, and the altar slid to the side, revealing a large passage down into the earth.\"Thank you. Come on, Oberlin.\" Thorn began walking down the passage, pulling Oberlin along with him.\"Are you sure about this, Thorn? This seems like a really bad idea.\"\"Relax, it will be fine. All we are doing is asking for a bit of your soul back.\"The passage they traveled down was smooth, reminding Thorn of the skin of a snake. After winding through the earth for a while, a passage opened up on the right, so Thorn and Oberlin turned and found themselves facing a large door. Without a sound, the door slid open, hiding itself in the wall. Passed the door was a vast hall lit by flickering candlelight. At one end there was a large altar, covered in small statues of a half-human, half-snake Naga. Each statue held a flickering pearl in outstretched hands. To the left and right were larger statues of snake people, armed with a variety of weapons, creating a sinister atmosphere. A robed figure stood waiting in the center of the hall, leaning on a snake head cane. \"Come in. I've been expecting you.\" The robed figure had a bizarre voice, it's cold tones seeming to slither uncomfortably around the room. \"No doubt you are here in a futile attempt to reclaim yourself.\"*ding*Curious, Thorn opened the notification he had just received, a wide grin stretching across his face as he read it. Agitated at being ignored, the robed figure stepped forward aggressively, lifting its staff.\"Whoa, hold up.\" Thorn raised a hand to stop the High Priest as he dismissed the notification. Stepping forward, he came to a stop in front of the robed figure, unaffected by the creepiness of the room. \"Why don't we drop the good guy, bad guy act and talk this through? I'm sure we can come to some sort of agreement. My name is Thorn, and I will be representing Oberlin. Our goal today is to retrieve the statue that contains a piece of his soul. How should I address you?\"The High Priest froze. After a moment had passed, the hood flipped down with a deep sigh, revealing long chestnut hair and a stunning face.\"My name is Josephine, High Priestess of the Ordo Serpentes. Please have a seat.\" With a brilliant smile, she gestured to the side, where a couple of carved stone seats were placed along the wall.\"Thank you, but I don't think that would go well for your chairs.\" Thorn smirked. Following Josephine over to the seats, Thorn squatted down as Oberlin took a seat.\"Now, you said that you want to negotiate for a soul piece? What makes you so confident that we will consider your offer?\" Crossing one shapely leg over the other, Josephine propped her chin in her palm and stared intently at Thorn.\"You would not have met us without a guard, otherwise.\" Thorn's advanced sense of smell had failed to pick up any other people in the room when he walked in.\"Hah. I don't know if it is a pleasure to talk to an intelligent person or if it is annoying. Since we are being straight-forward, why don't you lay your cards on the table? What can you offer for the statue?\"\"Honestly, I'm not sure. I haven't really thought that far ahead.\"\"You are trying to tell me you walked in here expecting us to just give you the statue? Don't insult me.\"\u00a0", "The sinister air of the Temple grew heavier as Josephine's words echoed around the room. Her voice took on the slithering quality that it had when they first walked in. The flickering torch light seemed to splutter and dim as the deep pools of inky black shadow deepened. Shivering slightly, Oberlin shrank back in his seat, throwing a frightened glance at Thorn who still looked calm.This was not what he had in mind when he had recruited Thorn for the quest, and he was quickly becoming worried that the situation was getting out of control. About to try and mediate, he had barely gotten his mouth open when Thorn spoke again.\"Actually, not only do I expect you to give me the statue, I'm pretty sure you'll give it to me for free.\" Without standing, Thorn reached out his hand to one of the stone chairs and squeezed the armrest.*BANG*Under his incredible strength, the armrest exploded into a cloud of dust, startling Oberlin badly. Josephine's eyes widened momentarily  in surprise, but her expression smoothedl so fast Thorn almost missed it.\"Ah, you are threatening me,\" the Head Priestess stated flatly, no change in her tone.\"Think of it less as a threat and more as encouragement. A fight wouldn't be in either of our interests. What would be better is if you just gave Oberlin here his cursed soul back. He has done some work for you, you've hunted him up and down the region, seems fair to call everything square and let it go at that.\"\"Surely you have more than that. There is no way you would walk in here without something else to rely on.\" Josephine uncrossed her legs and stood, looking mockingly down at Thorn. Or rather, she tried to. It was difficult to look down on someone who, crouching, was at eye level.\"You were not joking about being straightforward, were you? Do you really want me to lay everything out? Okay.\" Thorn rose to his feet, stretching out to his full 8' 9\" height and gazing down on the robed High Priestess. \"The truth is, I have a quest to crush your altar and all the statues.\"\"Ah ha, the truth comes out. I thought I felt a familiar aura on you.\" A wide smile spread across Josephine's pretty face as she backed up to get out of Thorn's reach.\"Can someone please explain what is going on?\" Oberlin complained. When the other two ignored him, he sighed and got up as well, moving to the side of the room. The air grew thicker as Thorn and Josephine confronted each other. Without warning, both turned and walked out to the middle of the large hall, as if they were of one mind. Summoning his tetsubo, Thorn planted the end in front of him.\"Why don't we start this over.\" Josephine spoke calmly, lifting her snake head cane.\"I am Thorn, Avatar of Hati, the Moon Wolf.\" \"Greetings, Thorn.\" Josephine gave a slight bow, her left hand on her chest and her cane held up. \"I am Josephine, Avatar of Salliish, the Shadow Serpent. Is this your first time participating in an Avatar challenge?\"\"Yes.\" Thorn was frank. \"Would you mind explaining how this is supposed to work? I get the feeling that killing you is not the point.\"\"That is correct.\" Josephine eyed Thorn's massive figure. \"Thankfully, this is not a duel to the death. While some Avatars do go that far, an Avatar challenge is more of a duel for supremacy. Contrary to the commonly held understanding, the gods never left, instead hiding themselves for reasons unknown. Yet they never truly stopped their grand game. Ever since the first era, Avatars have continued to seek each other out to compete against each other.\"Challenges can come in all shapes and sizes, the only constant is that they are triggered when two or more avatars find themselves near each other. Avatars must state their challenge to activate it, and will be penalized or rewarded with the favor of their sponsoring deity based on failure or success. You can think of favor like a currency that unlocks reward tiers from the deity. When you walked in, I was notified that you were an Avatar and that I was to challenge you to a contest of strength. Since you are here for your friend's soul, why don't we make this simple? If you can beat me, you get his soul. On the other hand, if I win, you have to do something for me.\"Thorn shook his head, \"I don't agree to unspecified favors.\"\"Then what do you suggest?\"\"Since we are dealing in souls, why not keep the currency consistent? If I win, you let him go. If you win, you let him go, but I'll join your organization.\"\"What!? No way!\" Oberlin shouted from the side.\"Now that is a deal I like the sound of.\" Josephine spoke at the same time as Oberlin, as if afraid that Thorn would take back his words. \"You for him. The battle will go until someone admits defeat. What I mean to say is, make sure you give up before you die!\" As her last word rang out, Josephine lifted her cane and thrust it forward.With lightning speed the cane stretched out, the snake head on the end growing larger and coming to life.Thankfully, Thorn had been watching closely, so he was able to get his weapon up in time to deflect the thrust. Still, the snap of the snake head's mouth next to his shoulder made him sweat.Seeing her attack fail, Josephine jumped backwards and raised her hands high overhead, a purple glow gathering in the mouth of the serpent head. Loud chants began to roll out of her mouth as the purple light grew stronger and stronger, bathing the room in strange slithering shadows.Tightening his grip on the handle of his weapon, Thorn was about to charge forward when warning bells started going off in his head. Shifting his momentum, Thorn threw himself to the side, dodging just as the tail of a giant snake landed where he had stood moments before. The marble floor cracked under the impact of the blow, chips of stone flying through the air.Focusing on this new enemy, Thorn faced the massive snake squarely. Almost fifty feet long, the snake was as thick as a barrel, with jagged black and purple scales running along its sides. Wicked fangs were visible as it hissed toward Thorn, its cold, yellow eyes staring unblinking at him. As the purple light fell on the snake's skin, it seemed to fade in and out of existence, melding with the dark shadows.Josephine stayed still, her hands raised, continuing her chant. Seeing how the snake seemed to fade out as it left Josephine's purple light, Thorn narrowed his eyes. As if feeling Thorn's glance at Josephine, the giant serpent shifted slightly to put itself between them, defending Josephine from a possible attack, further reinforcing Thorn's assumption. \"Let's test the theory,\" Thorn thought, and stepped forward.Lashing out with his tetsubo, Thorn aimed for the snake's side with a light probing strike. *tink*The hardened purple scales deflected the blow with ease. Thorn, borrowing the momentum, swung his weapon again. And again, the blow was deflected. Undeterred, Thorn continued to lash out with increasing speed. Unable to react to the speed of the strikes, the giant snake stayed curled up, weathering the storm of blows.In between the tiny gaps in the coils, Thorn could see the snake's eyes watching for the slightest break in his rhythm. Its attention was entirely fixed on Thorn. Just as Thorn and the snake locked eyes, its head shot out from between its coils, forcing Thorn to abandon his latest attack and block in front of his chest.With a crash, the serpent rammed into Thorn, sending him flying backwards into one of the Naga statues. Coughing, Thorn scrambled to his feet. As he did, the snake struck again, this time biting at Thorn and forcing him to tumble out of the way. Missing by less than an inch, the snake did not pursue Thorn, instead withdrawing back into the protection of its coils.Staggering up, Thorn wove on his feet as he got his bearings. The snake was still in between him and Josephine, who was watching the fight with much glee, her staff still shedding purple light on the fight.\"Haha, how do you like my pet? She is pretty strong, isn't she?\" Josephine gloated. \"Eh, not too bad.\" Rolling his shoulders, Thorn did not seem overly impressed. \"Let's start round two.\" Charging forward, Thorn once again threw out a storm of attacks. His weapon flew through the air, raining down blow after blow on the scaly skin of the giant snake to little effect. To the side, Oberlin stared at Thorn, a huge frown on his face. He had never intended for Thorn to get so enmeshed in his issue, and he felt terrible that Thorn was fighting on his behalf. As he continued to watch, his breath caught. Once again, Thorn had been sent flying into the wall, this time bringing down a bow-wielding Naga statue.Yet, as this cycle continued, Oberlin's frown turned to confusion. Over and over again, Thorn was struck, flying through the air to smash into the wall, destroying the room spectacularly. However, what was strange was that Thorn always seemed to hit a new statue each time he went flying. Soon, it wasn't just Oberlin who was confused.Josephine seemed to have caught on that something was wrong. Thorn was flying around like a human bowling ball, smashing into everything. Yet each time he hit the wall, he bounced back up, no worse for wear. His attacks were just as persistent and quick, as if he was using up no energy. Growing frustrated, Josephine bit her bottom lip before shouting a command to the giant snake. Quickly uncoiling, the snake slithered back, wrapping itself around her. \"What are you playing at? I can't believe an Avatar would be so weak. Especially an Avatar of the god of night. You should know that failing a challenge brings serious penalties,\" Josephine warned Thorn.\"But I'm not failing. I only have the altar left.\" Thorn pointed at the altar behind Josephine.\"What?\" Looking around, realization mixed with a sense of horror dawned on Josephine's face. \"You tricked me.\"\"I told you I had a quest to crush your altar and all the statues.\" Thorn smiled slightly. \"According to the rules you listed, an Avatar must state their quest and give their opponent a fair chance to prevent them from achieving it. I did that. I told you that I had to smash the altar and all the statues.\"\"And I assumed you were talking about the statues on the altar. Very tricky.\" The High Priestess narrowed her eyes as she glared at Thorn. \"Well, I'm afraid you'll pay for that.\" Whispering an arcane word, the purple orb in the mouth of her cane flashed brightly, forcing Thorn to squint. When the light cleared, the giant snake was gone. Instead, Josephine rose in the air, her body growing larger, a snake tail replacing her body from the waist down just like the Naga statues.\"No one can trick me and get away with it! The glory of Salliish, the Shadow Serpent cannot be maligned!\" As she grew, her robe fell away, revealing tight fitting armor that grew with her. Jagged claws grew from her fingers and her hair began to wave as if it were alive. Her eyes pulsed with purple light, and she roared, shaking the room. Flecks of stone and little bits of dust and dirt fell from the ceiling.Her eyes fixed on Thorn, Josephine shot forward, her snake tail sending her sliding around the floor as she advanced. Her unpredictable movement made her hard to pin down, but Thorn was not particularly worried. To Oberlin's surprise, Thorn even put away his tetsubo and stepped back heavily, his feet hitting the stone floor so hard they left cracks in it. Spreading his hands, Thorn dropped into a martial arts stance, a wide grin spreading across his face.\"Haha, I'm finally facing something I can use my training on!\" Thorn thought joyfully to himself. Every single fight he had participated in to this point was with people or creatures much smaller than himself. Josephine's Naga form was much more his size. In fact, with her tail extended, she was taller than he was. Plus, her upper body had grown larger to account for the tail, so she was the perfect target for Thorn to use to practice his taijiquan.With a piercing scream, Josephine lunged forward, her large claws outstretched. Rather than bracing himself, Thorn casually stepped forward, his front foot sliding across the floor smoothly as his hands came up to intercept the attack. With a twist of his torso, he deflected the attacking Naga, tossing her to the side.Furious, she tried to knock Thorn back with her flailing tail, only for Thorn to accept the blow head on. Her tail hit Thorn's solid figure and bounced off, unable to move him in the slightest. With a screech of pain, Josephine slid backwards, out of Thorn's reach. \"What did you do?\" Her pretty eyes were aflame with anger as she glared at Thorn.\"What do you mean? I'm not sure I am following.\"\"Why can't I knock you back? My summon could throw you all over the place!\"\"Oh, that. Yeah, I'm not jumping anymore.\" Thorn shrugged. \"I'm pretty heavy, so I am not easy to move. However, I've noticed that the game compensates for my weight when I jump, otherwise I'd never be able to get off the ground. So, as long as I intend to jump right before something hits me, I'll move. But I don't have any more statues to smash, so there isn't a reason to let you toss me around.\"\"This is stupid! How am I supposed to beat you in a contest of strength! You're as dense as a mountain!\"\"So are we done?\"\"In your dreams!\" Chanting, a purple mist gathered in Josephine's hands, quickly solidifying into a bow. Hissing, she drew back the string and a purple arrow with a two-pronged head appeared, aimed at Thorn. \"Die,\" she hissed, releasing the arrow straight at Thorn's heart.For a brief second, Thorn considered trying to block the arrow, but seeing how fast it was coming, he gave up that thought immediately and dove to the side. Too fast to completely dodge, the arrow cut into Thorn's side, punching its way straight through his armor and ripping a gash along his ribs. Grunting in pain, Thorn dashed behind a pillar, barely dodging the second arrow. Feeling the burning of the wound, Thorn looked down to see the edges of the cut slowly taking on a purple tinge. Poison. He needed to end this fight fast.", "Darkness dominated the edges of the room, allowing even Thorn to hide. Torchlight cast long shadows against the walls of the underground temple. The stone floor was cold to the touch, and the pillar at his back was hard. Despite the chill, Thorn was happy to have solid stone between him and Josephine's poison arrows.The arrows themselves were not that dangerous. Thorn's massive body was much too dense for serious damage from them, despite their sting. The purple poison coating her arrows was an entirely different matter. Thorn could feel the poison numbing him and slowly draining his health. He did not know if it would fade over time or if his health would continue to drain until he died, and he was not about to risk his life experimenting with them now.About to peek out from behind the pillar, instinct made him jerk his head back just in time to avoid another arrow. That same instinct prompted him to dive away from the pillar as Josephine's massive snake tail smashed through it, showering him with fragments of stone.Scrambling behind another pillar, arrows clipping at his heels, Thorn thought frantically, \"I need to close the distance, but those poison arrows are no joke.\"\"Ha, not so tough now, are you?\" Near the altar, Josephine's Naga form swayed from side to side as she released arrows at Thorn's hiding place. \"That's right. Keep hiding! Just like that craven god of yours!\"At Josephine's words, something in Thorn's chest began to burn, sending hot adrenaline straight up into his brain. Without thinking about the consequences, Thorn grabbed a large chunk of stone from one of the pillars that Josephine had smashed and stepped out from behind his cover. His eyes burning intently, Thorn glared at the Naga, his teeth clenched in visible rage.*ding* Dismissing the notification without reading it, Thorn's gaze was firmly fixed on Salliish's Avatar. Gone was the gentle, unassuming aura that Thorn normally projected. Under the effect of [Wolf's Rage] Thorn resembled a smoking volcano more than a peaceful mountain. His tightened muscles seemed to stretch his chainmail to the edge of breaking, as if it were containing a monstrous pressure just waiting to rip free.Something about the titan's gaze pierced Josephine's soul, unnerving her. Sneering to hide her discomfort, she pointed an arrow directly at his heart.\"You think you are the only one with powerful abilities? My poison won't take long to bring you down, so no matter what you do, you are toast. Why don't you just give up this pointless struggle? Salliish crushed Hati in the past, and no matter how you struggle, you cannot escape the coils of the god of Shadow.\"\"Coil around this.\" Taking a sudden step forward, Thorn wound up and threw the large chunk of pillar that he had picked up with as much force as he could muster. With a tremendous ripping sound, the stone cut through the air toward Josephine. Horrified by the force and speed of the rock, Josephine froze, forgetting to release the arrow she was pointing at Thorn. Blurring through the air, the stone passed Josephine's head, the force of its passing ripping out a few strands of her waving hair as it went. Cursing his lack of practice throwing things, Thorn stormed forward, protecting his head with one arm while getting ready to smash out with his tetsubo. It took Josephine half a second to snap out of her shock, and when she did, Thorn had already crossed half of the distance between them. With a hiss of fury, she slid back on her giant snake tail, shooting a poisoned arrow at the advancing titan. Not even bothering to dodge, Thorn took the shot directly in his chest. Feeling the sting as the arrow sunk into his chest, Thorn ignored it and continued pushing forward, focusing exclusively on getting into melee range. Continuing to kite backwards, Josephine was able to release one more arrow before her back hit a pillar. In her haste, the arrow cut past Thorn's shoulder, disappearing into the darkness behind him. Seeing that Thorn was only a few steps away, she turned and curled her body around the pillar, slithering up it as she readied another arrow. Undeterred by her escape, Thorn drew back his tetsubo and, with a tremendous bellow, smashed at the pillar.  *BOOM*Massive chunks of stone rained down, pelting the floor and walls as the pillar exploded. With a terrified shriek, Josephine lost her grip, falling down to the rubble-littered floor. Having lost her concentration, the bow she had summoned disintegrated into purple mist. Reaching through the scattering mist, Thorn grabbed Josephine and lifted her into the air.\"Concede, or I'll crush you,\" Thorn growled through clenched teeth.\"Hah.\" Regaining some of her wits, Josephine wrapped her giant tail around Thorn, squeezing for all she was worth. His eyes narrowing, Thorn stood unmoving as the coils tried in vain to crush him. The fury in his chest built, and it was all Thorn could do to not smash Josephine into the floor. Controlling himself with effort, he wrapped a large hand around her tail and pulled, separating himself from her coils.\"Enough, lets be done with this, or so help me, I will end it.\" For a moment, Josephine was silent. Finally, she sighed and her body shrank, separating from the giant snake who faded into the shadows.\"Yes, we are done. I concede.\"*ding* Looking at the quest popup, Thorn confirmed that his quest had completed. His rage still had not faded, but keeping it tightly under control, he put Josephine down.\"Do you have an antidote for this poison?\"\"Yes.\" Sullenly she pulled a vial out of her inventory and handed it to him.\"Thank you.\" Gulping down the antidote, Thorn felt the burning sensation fade from his wounds.  Josephine stared, completely dumbfounded as he, without flinching, pulled the two arrows that were stuck in his chest out, ignoring the spurt of blood that accompanied each one. The red hot fury in his chest was starting to fade, leaving behind an empty, tired feeling. Looking around at the utter ruin around him, Thorn could not help but wince. He had always been a careful, controlled person who tried his best not to break or hurt anything, but that seemed to have flown out the window after coming into Nova Terra. He was not the only one looking about the room in dismay.\"You are like a human wrecking ball!\" The Avatar of Salliish was ready to pull her hair out over the state of the underground temple. Rubble from the broken statues and demolished pillars littered the room, and only a few torches had survived the frenzied struggle.With a smile, Thorn turned to Oberlin, who was still cautiously waiting to the side, and gestured him over.\"You can go ahead and get your statue.\"\"Uh, that's okay. I might stay over here.\" Oberlin shook his head while he nervously patted his belt pouch, not wanting to get anywhere near Josephine, who had resumed her High Priestess look, cloak and all. \"No problem. I can get it for you.\" Thorn looked back at the altar. \"Which one is it?\"\"I think it is one of the ones on the front corner.\"\"You mean one of these?\" Thorn walked forward toward the altar while pointing. \"Wait a second, would you consider taking a different prize?\" Josephine stepped in front of Thorn, blocking him from the table.\"What are you trying to do?\" Thorn's eyes narrowed. \"I can provide you with all manner of things that are better than a silly statue. After all, the statue is of no use to you. It is only useful to the cowardly thief over there. Salliish has informed me that he thinks highly of you and is willing to give you magic items or wealth, even a high position in our organization if you are willing to give up on the statue.\" \"The Order of Snakes, or something, right?\"\"Ordo Serpentes.\" \"Right, that. I wouldn't have to pledge myself to Salliish, would I?\"\"No, serving Salliish is not required. Though, the Shadow Serpent is a gracious Lord and would surely bless you greatly if you wished to submit to him.\"\"Nah, not interested.\" Thorn waved his hand dismissively.\"Don't be so quick to turn me down, Thorn. Even if you do not want to serve Salliish, there is room for you in the Ordo Serpentes. The benefits are fantastic and the pay is generous. Especially for someone with talents like yours.\"\"Isn't the whole point of the Snake Order to sneak around? You know, shadows and stuff?\"\"It's the Ordo Serpentes!\" Struggling to put a lid on her temper, Josephine's eyes narrowed. \"The Order does have covert operations, but that is only a small part of the greater Order. While we have an intelligence organization that rivals even that of Avalon, our force can be compared to the largest of guilds.\"\"Hmm. Then why haven't I heard about you before?\"\"For one, the majority of our forces are focused in the southern continent. While we gather intelligence in the north, we are short staffed among the human lands. If you were willing to join us, it isn't impossible that you could grow to control an entire army here in the northern continent. Imagine, a full army of players who would jump to obey your every word!\"\"Players?\" Thorn's eyebrows rose in surprise. \"The Ordo Serpentes is a player organization?\"\"Like most of the larger organizations in the game, it is mixed. We have countless natives that support us, but players make up the majority of the foot soldiers in the Order.\"\"This all sounds interesting, but really restrictive. Plus, I don't think Hati likes your god so much.\"\"Please, what does that matter? They don't have to like each other for us to work together.\" Josephine rolled her eyes. \"What is important is what you can get out of it.\"\"So far, you have not actually told me what I can get out of joining you. And don't give me that talk about becoming a leader in the north. There is no way that you would just hand me an army.\"\"As I said earlier, it is nice talking to intelligent people,\" Josephine giggled. \"Of course, like any title or class, you would have to work for authority. But the Order does have a number of classes and titles available. There are even triple category classes that you can trade merit for. In the shorter term, you would gain access to the information network, supply points all over the northern and southern continent, access to specially crafted gear, and much more.\"\"And what would I have to do for all of these things?\"\"You would be assigned a quest every two months. The rest of your time is yours to do what you want. Additionally, if a war were to break out, you would have to participate. Oh, did I mention that you would get paid?\"\"You pay?\"\"Of course. It is a fairly standard non-disclosure, employment contract. You would be hired as a professional player, and we provide a generous compensation package based on your level in the organization. With your raw power, it would not surprise me if you were making six figures soon.\"\"That is a very kind offer, but I think I'm good. I'll take the statue now.\" Thorn shook his head.\"You really are dense. The statue is useless. Why not take the...\"In the middle of Josephine's question, Thorn's eyes flickered and, without waiting for her to finish, he took a large step forward, his massive hand shooting out and pushing her to the side. With a short scream, the High Priestess flew through the air, tumbling to the ground when she landed. Two long steps brought Thorn to the altar where he saw some of the statutes had lost their glow. More and more of the glowing orbs held by the statues were fading out by the second, leaving dim, lifeless orbs behind.Gritting his teeth angrily, Thorn pulled his tetsubo and swung hard, smashing straight through the still glowing statues. The blow crushed the statues into pieces, sending shards of stone flying through the air. As each statue broke, the glowing orb in its hand dissipated, a sigh rising up into the air. The first blow cleared three quarters of the table, and the reverse swing cleared the rest. Many of the statues along the edge of the table had already gone dark when Thorn attacked, the orbs simply shattering along with the statues. The statue that Oberlin had pointed out fractured and broke, the pieces scattering across the floor. Furious, Thorn turned to glare at Josephine, who was staggering to her feet, white faced. The now broken statues lay scattered across the floor.\"That was not part of the deal.\" Her voice trembling slightly, Josephine faced Thorn. \"Neither was whatever you were doing,\" Thorn growled. \"Pulling the souls out of the statues before we retrieve his is not playing fair.\"\"I'm sorry, I don't have any control over what Salliish does.\" Josephine couldn't help but take a step back under Thorn's glare. \"But you do have control over what you do.\" Thorn's anger burned hot in his chest, and he forcefully restrained it. \"The thing I hate most is people lying to me or trying to trick me.\"Furious, Thorn turned back to glare at the altar. Reliefs along its sides showed a giant serpent that seemed to be moving in the flickering light. The shadows danced, growing larger and larger. Behind Thorn, Josephine gasped.With a whoosh the few flickering torches flared brighter, the rising flames causing the shadows in the room to jump. Streaming together, the shadows intertwined, forming dark, twisted cords, meeting over the altar. As Thorn looked closely, he could see glittering scales forming as the pillar of shadows grew.\"Um, Thorn, something is happening, and I don't think that it's good.\" Oberlin pointed nervously at the shadows gathering on top of the altar.", "Grim-faced, Thorn watched the growing shadows as they solidified into the form of a massive snake. Even larger than the snake that Josephine had summoned previously, this snake was black as night, it's dark scales seeming to absorb the last remaining light in the room.[FOOLISH MORTAL] boomed a voice, seeming to come from nowhere and everywhere. [CROSSING ME WAS THE WORS...].*BANG*The voice cut off abruptly as Thorn stepped forward and slammed a fist into the altar, sending a massive vibration through the room. With a tremendous cracking sound, the altar split straight down the middle. Josephine froze, shock painted on her features. She watched in growing horror as Thorn kicked one of the halves of the altar away, grabbing the other and hoisting it over his head with a grunt.  She flinched as Thorn smashed it into the ground, sending shards of black stone flying across the floor.As the echo reverberated around the chamber, Thorn stood for a moment, his breathing calming. After a moment, he turned, all signs of anger gone from his face. Ignoring Josephine, Thorn looked toward the side of the room where a figure detached itself from the shadows and gave him a grin, patting the belt pouch at its waist.\"Big enough distraction for you?\" Thorn asked Oberlin, while brushing shards of black stone from his greaves. \"Yes, sir.\" Oberlin's grin widened. \"I don't think I've ever seen a better one. Seriously though, how freakishly strong are you? Those snakes were huge!\"Thorn ignored the question, turning to look at Josephine, who was still in shock. He gave her a slight bow.\"It was very nice to meet you, Josephine. Thank you for explaining how the Avatar challenges work and for entertaining us all this time. We have to get going now and cannot help to clean up, but I'm sure we'll run across each other again.\"\"Yeah, I'm sure we will,\" Josephine said, her bright eyes fixed on Thorn.Slightly uncomfortable being stared at like that, Thorn waved to Oberlin, and they quickly left the underground temple. As they made their way up to the surface, Thorn heard a notification. Taken aback, Thorn hesitated for a moment before he hit the accept button. At his side, Oberlin chatted away, obviously in a good mood. Pushing the door to the outside open, the thief froze. Standing in front of the building was a half circle of rough looking players, all staring at the door. Thorn, seeing Oberlin stop, frowned slightly and moved him aside, stepping past him to face the other players.\"Excuse me, do you mind moving? We are headed out of town.\"\"Oh, are you?\" At Thorn's words, a tough looking human with a scar running across his lips stepped forward. \"You haven't paid the tax though. How are you going to come into our town and not pay the tax?\"\"Tax? For coming into town? Are you serious?\"\"Do I look like I am joking?\" Despite facing Thorn's imposing bulk, the scarred man spat on the ground in front of his feet. \"It doesn't matter how big you are, if you don't want to die, you better pay up.\"\"And how much is the tax?\"\"Haha, that is a better attitude,\" growled the scarred man. \"Five gold for the thief, ten gold for you since you are oversized.\"\"And if I don't pay?\"\"Then you can enjoy some time in Fantasia. And when you come back, we can have this conversation again.\"Feeling a tug on his arm, Thorn looked down at Oberlin.\"We'll respawn here, since this is the last town we've visited.\"\"Oh,\" realization dawned on Thorn's face. \"So if we don't pay the tax, they'll kill us and then keep killing us when we respawn.\"\"Yup. That is why most people don't visit red towns.\" Oberlin nodded, not seeming worried.\"Huh, I can see why.\"Annoyed that he was being ignored, the scarred thug stepped forward threateningly. Unfortunately, that brought him closer to Thorn, making the difference in their size more pronounced. He quickly took a step back.\"Fork over the gold or face the consequences!\"\"Oberlin, you said that there are no town guards?\"\"No, there are guards, but they don't really come out. And if they do, it's only to extort people. They are always absent when a player breaks a rule that would get them locked up in another town. But the benefit is that they will not stop you, so long as you don't mess with the native in charge of the town.\"\"Good.\" His voice turning flat, Thorn's eyes locked onto the scarred thug. Stepping forward, his hand shot out like lightning, swatting away a vain attempt to block and grabbing him firmly by his chest armor. Lifting the thug, whose face had paled, Thorn turned slightly and launched him with all of his strength.*BOOOM*A nearby building, unable to withstand the force of a human smashing through its walls, collapsed in a storm of splinters and plaster.The rest of the thugs, who were in the middle of drawing their weapons, paused. As one, their eyes fixed on the now collapsed building that Thorn had just thrown their leader through. They looked at Thorn, then at the building, then back at Thorn. With a clang, they put their weapons back in their sheaths and turned to walk away.\"Hey!\" Thorn had barely gotten a single word out when the bandits broke into a mad dash, disappearing before he could get his second word out. \"Aren't... Okay, I guess not.\" Thorn looked at Oberlin, who shrugged. Shaking his head, Thorn walked out of Vermin.\"You know, Thorn, you could make a pretty awesome warlord,\" Oberlin suddenly announced as they walked.\"Sorry, not interested.\" Thorn shook his head, changing the subject. \"Did you get your soul back?\"\"Yes, thanks to you keeping the High Priestess busy.\" Oberlin pulled a glowing orb out of his inventory.\"Wow. I have to say, that is really impressive. I did not see you take it, and I was staring at the table pretty much the whole time.\"\"There is a reason my class has 'Master' attached.\"\"Did you get your new class?\"\"Yup, [Infinite Key Master]. Makes me even better at opening locks. There are a couple other bonuses, but it is pretty focused on getting into things other people want to keep you out of.\"\"Well, I know who to call if I lose my keys. Does this make you the only person in the game to have mastered a dual category class?\"\"Possibly.\" Oberlin was not as excited as Thorn imagined. \"Honestly, it is pretty much impossible to know. There are a lot of players that don't talk about their game time. Unless you are getting the information from Eve herself, I would take everything you hear with a grain of salt. For example, I have no idea what that business about avatars was about. I thought all the gods fell to the dragons. Everyone has their own secrets.\"\"What are your plans now that you have gotten your soul back? You're free to go anywhere now, right?\"\"Helping you, of course. I only got the orb back because you helped me. There is no way I would have managed to sneak it out otherwise. For now, you're stuck with me.\" Oberlin grinned, looking happier than he ever had. \"I am still working on the chests; it seems like the locks require specific quest items to open. As soon as I figure out what we need to find, I'll let you know. Until then, I am going to walk around behind you, since you make just about the best shield there is. You threw that guy through a building. Isn't that cheating or something?\"Continuing to chat, they made their way toward Berum. Nova Terra had no fast travel system, so Thorn fully expected it to take a couple days to make the trek. If he had been by himself, he could have run, shortening the distance considerably, but Oberlin lacked Thorn's stamina, so he set the pace.As they camped that night, Thorn spent some time looking through his messages, replying to his aunt and a note sent by his sifu. Mina had gotten back to him as well, setting up a time and place to meet, her excitement and nervousness obvious by the tangled tone of the message. Thorn was still not sure what he was going to do when he met with Mina and Velin, but he felt that he should at least try to restore the relationship.As he stared up at the stars, Thorn knew that they were fake and yet, he could not help but marvel at their grandeur. There was a feeling of freedom in his heart as he lay under the stars that Thorn had never experienced before. Beneath the dark expanse of space, how small he felt, and how wonderful that was. As his appreciation of the beauty of the night sky grew, the problems in his heart melted away. It took two days for Thorn and Oberlin to arrive at Berum. Oberlin was so happy that they were done walking that he nearly cried. Ignoring him, Thorn nodded to the city guards, who were looking at him with suspicion. Though completing the [Trouble at Embersplit Mine] quest had cleared the [Criminal] title, the last memory the guards in Berum had of him was trying to find chains that would fit around his massive wrists.Much like regular people, the natives of Nova Terra had long memories. Just because he had been cleared of his crime, they did not forget that they had thrown him in jail not too long ago. Already nervous when they had to arrest Thorn, they were even more nervous now that he had gotten out and returned to Berum. Thorn, on the other hand, barely thought about it at all. He walked past them into the city, leaving Oberlin sitting on the ground where he had collapsed dramatically.\"Hey, wait up.\" Oberlin dragged himself off the ground and chased after Thorn's massive back. \"You are meeting up with some of your old party members, right? When do you meet them?\"\"Tonight. We are meeting at a bar near the courthouse at six. Still a couple hours, so I am going to get something to eat.\"\"Sheesh, do you ever stop eating? You were eating almost all morning as we walked.\"\"There is a lot of me to keep up with.\"\"Fair point.\"The last time he had been in Berum, Thorn had been a regular at an inn called the Speckled Hen. As he walked in that familiar direction, Thorn began to realize that the townsfolk were staring at him. Every time he turned down a street, the players would move out of his way, but otherwise ignore him. On the other hand, the natives were much more concerned about him, pointing and whispering to each other.\"You are pretty popular.\" The attention was so obvious that even Oberlin noticed. \"I'm not sure why. Last time I was here, no one paid any attention to me.\"\"Sure, but you also were not a violent criminal. Killing someone in town is not common. And who knows when you'll snap and kill someone else. Haha,\" Oberlin laughed at his own joke. \"But seriously, the last thing the townsfolk remember about you is that you were arrested. Your size makes you easy to remember. Don't be surprised if your reception is less than friendly.\"Arriving at the Speckled Hen, Thorn ducked through the door, Oberlin following him. Thorn had originally picked this inn because of the tall ceilings that let him stand freely. As they entered, the innkeeper hurried up, a big smile on his face.\"Thorn! It is great to see you! It has been a long time. Were your charges cleared? There were some terrible rumors going around about you, but I know you. There is no way that could have been true.\"\"Hello, Gerald.\" Thorn smirked at Oberlin, who was standing next to him, his mouth hanging open in shock. \"Yeah, I was able to get the confusion cleared up. Is Elsie still cooking lunch? I know I'm a bit late, but I'm starving.\"\"Of course, of course. You go get a seat, and I'll let her know you are here!\" Gerald pointed them to an open table in the corner that had a large tree stump instead of a chair and bustled off toward the kitchen.\"What was that?\" Oberlin was still confused as he pulled up a chair to the table. \"Are you related to him? He treated you like his long lost son.\"\"Haha. No, this is where I ate when I stayed in Berum last time.\" Thorn, waved at one of the waitresses who recognized him.\"So? I eat at lots of place...oh.\" Realization dawned on Oberlin's face. \"You mean this is the only place you ate? And they are still in business? Your appetite must have been smaller back then.\"\"Yeah, my meals generally cost me about a gold a day. Half a gold on days I am getting food to go.\"\"Sheesh. No wonder he likes you. Just shows the power of gold.\"Soon steaming plates of food arrived, filling up the table and half of another table that Gerald pulled up. Watching the food rapidly disappear into the bottomless pit that was Thorn's stomach, Oberlin could only shake his head and do his best to snatch some food before it was gone.Once the food was gone, Oberlin leaned back and looked at Thorn.\"What next? You said you need to do some research to try to find the location of a castle, right?\"\"Yes. Greymane Keep. I need to meet someone tonight who, depending on how the meeting goes, may be able to give us a hand figuring out the right location. If not, I was planning on digging through the library to see if I can find any references.\"\"Library is good. There are some groups that specialize in-game knowledge, but that can get expensive fast.\"\"Money won't be an issue,\" Thorn stated with certainty.\"In that case, we'll want to talk to Avalon. They have the deepest understanding of Nova Terra. Most expensive, of course, but if you have the coin, there is almost nothing they can't find.\"\"How do we get in contact with them?\"\"You'll need a referral.\" Oberlin fished around in his pouch for a minute, pulling out a silver-bordered card with a large embossed A. \"They have people all over. Look for a shop with this symbol on the sign, and then have a former customer introduce you. I've picked up info from them before, so I can make the introduction.\"\"Shops?\" \"Yeah, The Children of Avalon are one of the biggest merchant guilds in Nova Terra, though their primary business is information.\"\"Alright. Then I'll rely on you if this meeting doesn't work out.\" Thorn nodded and rose to his feet, dropping a gold coin on the table. A few hours later, he found himself standing in front of the bar where he was going to meet Mina and Velin. All day he had been able to remain calm, but now, faced with the reality of having to see them again, his stomach was in knots. Oberlin had noticed how tense Thorn was getting as the time for the meeting approached and had slipped away, leaving Thorn alone. Taking a deep breath, he pushed the door open.", "The interior of the bar was bustling, filled with players and natives drinking and talking. In contrast to the rowdy atmosphere, the table where Mina and Velin sat was quiet. Velin was as expressionless as ever, though there was a tension beneath her calm exterior. Mina, on the other hand, could not stop fidgeting nervously.\"Do you think he will come?\" Mina clenched her cup.\"Probably.\"\"But what if he is still mad?\"\"We'll have to see.\"\"I want to apologize, but I don't know how I am supposed to face him.\"\"Mina, I'm sure it will be fine.\" The two lapsed into momentary silence.\"But what if he doesn't forgive us?\"Not bothering to respond, Velin closed her eyes. Mina had been a bundle of nerves ever since she got Thorn's short response. And Mina was not the only one. While it might not show on the outside, Velin could feel the tension in her shoulders. They had done something terrible and she could feel the weight of it. And who knew if Thorn was going to forgive them.Her eyes still closed, Velin could feel the moment Thorn walked into the room. The general hubbub died down as people glanced over at the sound of the door, their voices pausing at the sight of the giant. Taking a deep breath, Velin opened her eyes, looking first at Mina, who was so nervous she had forgotten to breathe.Thorn crossed the room, his big strides putting him in front of the table within a few steps. Moving the extra chair out of the way, he gestured to the table.\"Mind if I squat here?\" Despite his initial butterflies, Thorn found it as easy to interact with the girls as before.\"P... Please do.\" Mina obviously did not.\"Thanks.\" Thorn pulled a large rock from his inventory and sat down on it. As he did, so Velin pulled out a small pyramid and activated it, creating a bubble around the group. For a moment the three of them sat in silence, looking at each other.\"Thorn...\" Mina's courage evaporated as Thorn's eye's turned to her, and her voice died out. Panicking, she looked at Velin, who took a deep breath.\"Thorn, what we did was terrible and unkind and cruel. They say that there is no medicine for regret, but both Mina and I deeply regret our actions, and we hope that you will someday forgive us. If there is anything we can do to make it up to you, please do not hesitate to say.\"Time seemed to pause for Thorn as his mind and emotions raced. His chest was a giant ball of conflicting feelings, and it took him a moment to gather his thoughts. He had rehearsed this conversation so many times in his head, but he was still not prepared. Now that he was faced with his betrayers, his mind was a jumbled mess.Velin and Mina had both abused and abandoned him once; what guarantee did he have that they would not do it again? They had tossed him aside for profit, yet here they were asking for forgiveness. All the raw emotion that Thorn had worked so hard to get under control during his time in the mine threatened to bubble up, and it took a few moments before he was able to get it under control.Thorn's head grew clear and his emotions calmed. They did not deserve his forgiveness, but that did not mean he couldn't forgive them anyway. As Thorn examined his heart, he found a desire for reconciliation. His goal in playing Nova Terra was to be free, and if he allowed himself to be bound by what they had done, he would never reach it. Others might see his choice as weakness, but he thought differently.\"Let's make one thing clear.\"Hearing his solemn tone, Mina paled.\"I forgive you.\"\"What?\" Both Mina and Velin exclaimed at the same time, unable to believe their ears.\"I forgive you,\" Thorn breathed out, his chest feeling much lighter. \"I've thought a lot about this, and I am going to make the choice to forgive you. What you did sucked, and it hurt me and don't you dare do something like that again, but I am not going to let it define who I am and what I do. If we can, I would love to restore our relationship. I'm sure there was more to the situation than I realized and, on some level, I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"You did not do me any permanent harm, so let's move past it. I'm not saying that everything will magically go back to normal, because it won't. But I think we can work on it. I would enjoy questing with you, and I think that, with time and effort, we can repair what has been broken.\"\"But we stole your destiny points!\"\"Sure, I understand.\" Thorn nodded at Mina, who was almost hyperventilating. \"But destiny points are not necessary for playing the game. And I still think you are my friends, otherwise you would not have sent me that message last week.\"\"Thorn, I'm sorry. I was the one who came up with the plan.\" Velin, who had been quiet, suddenly spoke.\"It's fine.\"\"No, it's not. It is kind and generous of you to extend forgiveness, but I need to take responsibility for my part. I am sorry for hurting you, and I will try my best to see that it doesn't happen again.\"\"Yeah, me too,\" agreed Mina, nodding her head. \"I'm sorry that I killed you like that.\"\"Thank you for your apology; you are forgiven. And Mina, I didn't die.\"\"What do you mean, you didn't die?\"\"You only knocked me out. Due to a technical issue, the game did not recognize me as dead, so once you left, and combat ended, my body healed, and I woke up.\"\"Oh, wow. I thought since you met Jorge on the stairs to the temple that you had respawned. He was going there to check if you logged back in.\"\"Ah, yeah. I was there to be healed. We had some words.\"\"I don't think 'had some words' covers it. He has barely logged in since then. What did you do?\" Velin asked, her eyes narrowed.\"Um. Well, I got a bit angry and might have thrown him at the wall.\"\"You threw a player at the wall so hard you had to go to jail for multiple weeks? So that means he died? How did you get past the damage reduction?\"\"Damage reduction?\"\"In towns, all players have pretty severe damage reduction applied to them. This is to prevent accidents and make it hard to assassinate other people. The most that should have happened is that his health would have dropped, and you would be fined by the guards.\"\"Ah, I did not know about that.\" Thorn smiled. \"No wonder everyone looked at me like I was a monster while I was in jail. As for how it happened?\" Thorn reached over and picked up Mina's metal mug, tossing it in his hand a couple of times. Then, without any effort, he crushed it into a little ball and dropped it on the table. \"I'm pretty strong.\"\"Well, no wonder he has not logged back in. I imagine that was quite a traumatizing death. Plus, I imagine that he is worried he might meet you again.\"\"If you talk to him, you can tell him I don't hold it against him. Oh, and I'm sorry for killing him. If he is willing to call it even, I can let it go.\"For a moment, the table lapsed into silence.\"What happened with Ouroboros? Where is he?\"\"I don't know.\" Mina looked upset thinking about the former party leader. \"Ever since he got his new class, he has been totally different. I don't like him anymore. We are not speaking!\"\"Our group broke up.\" Velin looked down at the table, her voice low. \"Something about his class, Exalted Devil Blood Berserker, has brought out the coldness in him. I'm not sure what it is, but he has become much more ruthless than he was in the past. Even with us. He has returned to Ragnarok to fight for a position in the leadership. I'm afraid I had a part to play in goading him into it.\" Velin looked down.\"Maybe, but you are not responsible for his actions. We all have to make our own decisions, and it sounds like he is making poor ones.\"\"Yes,\" Velin sighed, \"but I understand why he is making those choices. He is under a lot of pressure from his family to succeed, and the person who controls Ragnarok will have incredible power, authority, and wealth. The temptation to run over everyone or everything that gets in your way is strong when so much is on the line. Still, we did not come here to talk about Ouroboros. We are here to find out how we can make up for our own poor decisions.\"\"I told you, I forgive you. There isn't anything you need to do.\" Thorn waved dismissively. \"I do have a quest that I would love help with, but I won't have any hard feelings if you don't join me.\"\"No, we'll do it!\" Mina slapped the table and declared before Velin could say anything.\"Of course we will.\" Velin nodded. \"What do you need?\"\"Okay. In that case, let me call our other team member. Once he gets here, we'll set up our plan of attack.\"Oberlin must have been hanging out right outside the bar, because almost as soon as Thorn sent him a message, he popped up next to the table.\"Velin, Mina, this is Oberlin. I met him before I got to know you, and we got re-acquainted over the last couple weeks. Oberlin, Velin and Mina.\" Thorn made the introductions.After a round of hellos, the group got down to business. Thorn explained that he had to find Greymane Keep for his quest but that it did not appear on any map that he had seen. The information that he obtained from the Pathfinder in Narthil had not contained any hints either.\"Hmmm. It is rare that a quest would not give any supplementary details. Can you describe the process through which you obtained the quest?\" Velin asked.\"I actually got it after I woke up in Hati's Ascent. I have to free the castle from werewolves.\"\"Ah, that helps quite a bit.\" Seeing the others' confused looks, Velin pulled out her notebook and flipped open to a blank page. Writing as she spoke, she began to explain. \"One of the basic rules of Nova Terra is that everything is connected. In fact, it is speculated that, if an individual makes a connection that is false, the game might create the connection so as to give players a heightened sense of achievement. Eve is smart enough to make this impossible to abuse, but it means that there are connections everywhere.\"What that means for us is that everything surrounding a quest is a clue. Take, for example, the place where the quest was activated. Hati's Ascent was a temple to the god of the night, Hati, the Moon Wolf. Hati was worshiped by those corrupted wolfkin that we fought in the dungeon. We also ran into regular wolfkin before we got to the dungeon. They were trying to gain access, just like us.\"Based on the composition of their group and the fact that we had never encountered that sort of creature, we can tell that they came from a good distance away. They did not have any pack animals though, and none of them were players, so they could not have come from too far away. This puts them between two and five days away.\"\"Wait, why do pack animals matter?\" Mina cut in, confused.\"No inventories,\" Oberlin and Thorn said at the same time.\"Exactly. Since they were natives, they did not have inventories, which means that they had to carry everything in packs. They had no tents, which means that all their pack space was probably food and other vital supplies. That means that they probably traveled for less than a week. Which would also make sense considering the shape their clothing was in. They would have been much rattier looking if they had been traveling for a long time.\"So, that gives us two pieces of information. First, the wolfkin at the temple that fell became werewolves, and the castle is in the hands of werewolves. Second, wolfkin that had not fallen were trying to get to the temple. This means that it is unlikely that the wolfkin came from the area around Greymane Keep. They may know where it is, however, so let's keep that in the back of our minds. Next, we know that the temple was situated in a wolfkin city. So it is likely that there is information in the city regarding the location of Greymane Keep.\"\"Oh no.\" Mina put her head in her hands.\"What is wrong?\"\"That whole area is under Ragnarok's control right now. One of the leaders has taken over that area to loot. Getting in and finding the right information will be difficult, if not impossible,\" Velin spoke calmly.\"Aren't you part of Ragnarok?\" Oberlin asked.\"We were. Suffice it to say, we are no longer part of the guild. So we may have some trouble. Angdrin, the officer in charge of this area, is not known for being helpful.\"\"Angdrin? Is he..?\" Thorn looked at Oberlin, who was nodding his head.\"Yeah. That is the guy from the mine. Haha, small world. Thorn fought him and his red-armored goons two days ago. And we swiped a bunch of stuff from them. So, I'm pretty sure that they will be even less helpful if they see us.\"\"Granted, that makes the situation easier, right? We can bust in and not worry about it. Since we're already enemies, I mean.\" Thorn smiled.\"I don't think that is a good idea.\" Mina frowned. \"The Crimson Snakes are really tough.\"\"Haha, they did not look that tough. Thorn killed six or seven of them in their last fight. He probably would have killed all of them if he hadn't tried to break a magic bubble with his bare hands.\"\"You what?\" Flabbergasted, Mina stared at Thorn. Angdrin's personal guard, while not being the absolute best of Ragnarok's fighters, were elite players. It was inconceivable that someone could wipe out so many of them, especially fighting all of them at once.\"Did I say that he tried to break a magic bubble? That's wrong. He did break a magic bubble with his bare hands. Cracked it open like an egg. You should have seen Angdrin's face, Haha! Anyway, he also crushed five of them with a large carriage full of ore,\" Oberlin bragged.\"Alright, I get the picture.\" Mina shook her head. \"To hear you brag, I almost thought that you were the one to fight them.\"\"Nah, I don't do that direct confrontation stuff. But I did pick up six boxes that looked pretty important while everyone was distracted.\" Oberlin smiled smugly.\"Alright, let's focus. Avoiding conflict is a smarter bet, since there are more of them than there are of us. What other avenues do we have for getting information, Velin?\" Thorn waved for Mina and Oberlin to be quiet.\"We have the library here in town. We may be able to find a reference somewhere if we look through ancient legends. Because the quest is tied to the era of the gods, our chances are best if we find a story about the wolfkin specifically. We could also look for old maps and compare them to our current world map. That is how we found the entrance to Davyos' Fall, the city where Hati's Ascent was. That is time-consuming, though. We could also go talk to Avalon. Are you familiar with how they work?\"\"Yes, Oberlin introduced me.\"\"Really, if we can't access the library from the city where we found the temple, our best option is to go find the wolfkin and see if they have any information. Unfortunately, they were hostile the last time we encountered them.\"\"Okay, then it looks like we're going to have to contend with Angdrin and the Crimson Snakes.\" Thorn picked up the balled-up cup.", "As the early morning light broke over the horizon, the forest awoke. A curious wren landed on a branch, its head cocking as it looked down at Thorn's prone figure. Stretched out along a hill, Thorn peeked over the top, looking down at the entrance to the canyon leading to Davyos' Fall. Even in the early morning hours, two red-armored players stood guard, watching for anyone who might disrupt their guild's operations.\"Do they really just stand there? What a strange way to play a game.\" Thorn spoke quietly to avoid alerting the guards.\"To them it isn't a game. It is a job. They play Nova Terra for a living, so it is the same as another job. They get benefits, get paid by the hour, it really is just like any other job. So, if their employer tells them to spend some time standing guard, they stand guard.\" Velin lay next to Thorn, looking down toward the canyon. \"They might be elite players, but they are on the low end of the totem pole.\"\"I guess that makes sense.\"\"When you two are finished chatting, can we get started?\" Oberlin's voice drifted over from somewhere nearby. Thorn could not, for the life of him, tell where Oberlin actually was, but he knew he was in the vicinity.\"Yeah, let's get going.\" Thorn scooted back down the hill far enough that his head would not be visible over the top when he stood up. \"Everyone remember the plan? We don't have much room for error here. Once they are alerted, it will be much harder for us to get through, so no messing around, okay?\"\"What? Why are you looking at me?\" Mina complained, adjusting her pointy hat. \"I'm an elite player, I know what to do.\"\"Great.\" Thorn ignored Mina's pouting. \"Velin, when you are ready.\"Nodding, the elven War Priestess pulled her staff out and walked over the hill toward the Crimson Snake guards, Mina by her side. As they came down the hill, the two guards perked up, lifting their swords and shields. After a moment of staring at the approaching girls, the guard on the left, a middle-aged man with a mustache, motioned for the other guard to put down his weapons when the two girls got closer.\"Miss Velin.\" Mustache bowed respectfully as they got closer.\"Morning. Do you know me?\" Velin greeted him, her face impassive.\"Yes, Miss. I worked a shift at headquarters last year and saw you with Lord Ouroboros. Congratulations on his advancement.\"\"Mmhm. Why are you on duty here?\"\"Lord Angdrin ordered that we guard this location to prevent anyone from other guilds from exploring beyond this point. There is an abandoned city and a dungeon in the canyon!\" The younger guard chimed in, excited to be talking to someone as famous as Velin. He lapsed into silence as he caught a glare from mustache.\"My apologies, miss, but you can't go beyond this point,\" Mustache said, tightening his grip on his sword and shield. \"The order is that the location is completely locked down. So no one can get in.\"\"Even if I'm just doing research in the tunnel? There is a magic door that I wanted to examine in more detail.\" Velin's cold face did not change expression at the guard's refusal.\"I'm sorry, orders are orders.\" Mustache shook his head, suppressing a shiver. He had always heard that Velin was cold, but he could swear that the actual temperature had dropped.\"Hmm. Shame.\" Velin shook her head and stepped to the side, revealing Mina with a silly smile on her face and a fully charged wand in her hands.\"[Avalanche]!\" Mina shouted, causing a massive flurry of snow to appear, burying the two guards before they could move. Stunned for a moment, they could not respond as a giant crossbow bolt flew down the hill, instantly sending the younger guard out of the game. Before the stunned state had worn off, Velin channeled a beam of pure energy into her staff, shooting it through Mustache's chest. He did not even have time for his expression to register his shock before he turned into motes of light.With both guards gone, Thorn hurried down the hill to the canyon entrance, meeting Oberlin, Velin, and Mina outside the tunnel that led to Davyos' Fall.\"Okay, that could have gone better, but we did account for the possibility of having to kill the guards. This means we are on a clock. We probably have less than an hour before we start seeing reinforcements. So we cannot waste time if we meet other guards inside,\" Velin said. The War Priestess was all business, hurrying them into the tunnel.Not worrying about stealth, the group burst into the room with the magical door just in time to see it click shut. Someone from the other side must have been alerted by the players that died and closed the door. At the sight of the closed door and active runes, Mina paled.\"It took us an hour and forty-five minutes to open it last time.\" Mina shook her head. \"There is no way we'll be able to get through.\"\"Hah, are you serious? For this thing?\" Oberlin materialized in front of the large bronze doors.\"What? You think you can do better?\"Oberlin just smirked as his hands began flying, tapping here and there on the runic lock. Seeing his actions, Velin's eyebrows rose. She looked at Thorn for confirmation and, seeing him readying his arbalest, she gave a small smile.\"Mina, get ready for another Avalanche. We need to make sure anyone on the other side of the door doesn't have a chance to run.\"\"Got it.\" Still slightly doubtful, Mina charged her wand.For a moment, the only sound in the tunnel was Oberlin's tapping hands. Everyone else stood silently as they got ready for whatever was on the other side of the door. In just three minutes the runic lock began to warp, finally dispersing with Oberlin's last tap.\"There you go,\" said the thief with a flourish.\"Thank you.\" Thorn stepped past him and pushed the door open violently, his arbalest leveled.On the other side of the door stood three more guards in the red armor of the Crimson Snakes. Two held swords and shields while one had a bow on his back. With a start, they scrambled to get into position, but it was too little too late. Almost by reflex, Thorn sent his bolt at the archer, who instantly exploded into motes of light, while Mina dropped her icy stun on the two shield-bearing warriors.Whether by luck or simply chance, the flurry of snow only caught one of them, the other managing to dive to the side. Yelling a war cry, the warrior who escaped the snow rolled forward, his shield in front of him as he attacked. Sadly for him, it did not go well. As he rose from the ground to approach Thorn, a massive foot lashed out, kicking the center of his shield.[CRACK]With a tremendous sound, the shield snapped in half, and the dumbfounded warrior was launched backwards, tumbling head over heels until he came to a stop almost twenty feet away. For a brief moment his body lay still and then peacefully faded. The stunned warrior fared no better and soon joined his companions in Fantasia.\"It will take us ten minutes to get to the city if we run, so let's get going.\" Velin did not dwell on the fight, instead moving the party along.To her surprise, Thorn put his arbalest away and scooped her and Mina up, one in each hand. Telling Oberlin to climb onto his back and hold on, Thorn began running, his strides growing longer as he sped up. Perched up on Thorn's broad shoulder, Mina giggled with glee at the landscape flying past.\"Who said this game doesn't have fast travel?\" she joked. Velin ignored her, holding on tightly.Each pounding footstep sent Thorn almost a dozen feet forward. Within less than a minute, the city came into clear view and, within three, they were at its edge. With a smile, Thorn let the ladies down as Oberlin jumped down from where he had been holding on to Thorn's armor.\"That works, too.\" Velin took a moment to fix her hair that had blown out of place during the mad dash. \"Let's look for the library. We are aiming for speed over stealth. Oberlin, you are in charge of keeping an eye out. Thorn, you'll be in charge of blocking anyone we come across with Mina. I'll find the library and look for our information.\"Sure enough, three blocks in Oberlin sent a message saying that there was a group of five red-armored players heading for them. Nodding to Velin, Thorn and Mina split off from the War Priestess and went to meet them head on. At first Mina wanted to try and ambush them, but after remembering the way Thorn manhandled the previous group, she just shrugged and followed behind him.The two groups met at a crossroads and immediately closed for combat. One of the Crimson Snakes had bows and one was wielding a staff. The other three held the familiar scimitar and round shield that Thorn had seen on the others. Charging forward, Thorn lifted his gauntlets to protect his head and neck.Seeing a giant thundering toward them, the shield-wielding Crimson Snakes paled. The message they had gotten only said that someone had breached the large doors to the valley; it said nothing about a giant.Two of the shield bearers braced for impact. The third, wanting no part of Thorn's charge, jumped aside. Lowering his body, Thorn sent two palm strikes into the center of the shields, blasting both players back. Not slowing at all, he continued to close on the archer who had just started shooting arrows. Lifting his hands, Thorn knocked the first out of the air but missed the second, grunting slightly as it punched through his paldron.Next to the archer, the staff-wielding caster was chanting, crimson mist spilling from her lips. Just as she started to raise her staff toward Thorn, a long, eerie howl rang out, echoing off of the surrounding buildings.[Wolf Lord's Howl]Taking advantage of the caster's momentary pause, Thorn suddenly accelerated, crossing the last few steps and ramming into her with his shoulder. With a sharp crack, her staff broke as she tumbled backwards. As he charged, Thorn had pulled out his tetsubo which he smashed sideways into the archer. Both of the ranged fighters dealt with, Thorn turned to the remaining Crimson Snakes.The warrior who had dodged Thorn's charge quickly found himself on the wrong end of a cold, sharp ice spike, leaving the two that Thorn had knocked aside scrambling to their feet, their pale faces a testament to how hard the palm strikes had been. Seeing that they were the last of their group alive, one of the warriors gritted his teeth and, holding his shield up to stop the icy spikes raining down on him, charged forward.\"Get backup!\" The warrior yelled over his shoulder as he swung his sword, trying to claim Thorn's attention.\"Nice try.\" Thorn grinned, appreciating his opponent's bravery. But appreciation did not stop him from backhanding him into a nearby wall. Dashing forward, Thorn was about to crush the last warrior with a strike from his tetsubo when the temperature suddenly plummeted. Shifting his weight to the side, Thorn threw himself forward in a roll, tumbling across the ground and smashing into some rotting barrels.\"[Sub Zero]!\" Mina shoutedBehind him, the Crimson Snake warrior who had been fleeing froze solid and a flurry of ice spikes quickly ended the fight. Getting to his feet, Thorn glared at the short witch.\"Careful where you throw your spells!\"\"It's area of effect, it's not my fault you are so big that pretty much everything hits you.\" Mina rolled her eyes as she moved to loot the bodies.\"I thought you were supposed to be an elite player. Friendly fire is not elite player behavior.\"\"It didn't hit you, did it?\"\"Yeah, but only because I jumped out of the way.\"\"Oh, stop complaining. You sound like a big baby. A really, really, really huge baby. Like, ginormous baby.\"\"Alright, I get it.\" Thorn shook his head, opening a message from Oberlin. \"What's up?\"\"More enemies incoming. Looks like the main force. Twenty-three Crimson Snakes, a mix of all sorts of classes. Angdrin is with them, along with the other two you nearly killed last time. We should probably leave soon.\"\"Alright, sit tight. Let me check in with Velin.\" Switching the message to hold, Thorn added Velin to the call. \"Hey, Velin, I have Oberlin on the line. He says we have the main group of Crimson Snakes, including Angdrin, on the way. What is your time frame?\"\"I'm not sure. I have not found anything yet.\" Velin's voice was laden with frustration. \"I'm trying a different building next to the library, and then I will be back.\"Surprised at the rare emotion, Thorn's brow furrowed.\"What is wrong? It sounds like you ran into a problem.\"\"Problem? I'd say. I went to the library, but it is gone. Completely gone. The books, I mean, the building is still here. It looks like a group recently moved the entire library. All of the shelves are completely cleared out. They did not leave a single book. Even the scroll racks have been cleared. Which means we probably have no chance of finding out what we need to know.\"\"Wait. All the books are missing?\" Thorn asked, his voice slow.\"Yeah. Who would waste their time moving so many books? Most of them are probably useless anyway, so it is just a ton of dead weight hanging out in their inventory. But whoever did it ruined any chance we have of getting a clue from here. I'm doing one last check to see if I can scrounge up anything of value.\" Velin paused, hearing only deep silence from the other side. \"Thorn? Thorn? Is everything okay?\"\"Hahahaha!\" Mina's laughter came over the call. \"Velin, you have got to see this!\"Standing in the middle of the street, a mortified giant was standing next to a large stack of books that he had just pulled from his inventory.", "\"You did what?\"\"Um.\" Carefully watching the glaring elven War Priestess with one eye, while shooting a glare of his own at Mina who was still doubled over laughing, Thorn tried to choose his words carefully. \"I picked up some books when we came through here the first time. You know how we split up? Well... I ended up at the library, so I thought I would take some books with me.\"\"Some books?\"\"Well, I sorta just kept putting them in my inventory. And my inventory is pretty big, so...\"\"Oh my goodness.\" Velin put her hand on her face, defeated. \"You have been carrying an entire library around with you this whole time? How are you still walking? Don't you know that weight decreases your movement speed and reaction time?\"\"Ah, no wonder I've been feeling so sluggish.\" Realization dawned on Thorn's large face. \"That makes a lot of sense.\"\"Forget it, let's figure out how we are going to get out of here.\" \"Right, we can go through the books later.\" Picking up the stacks of books he had pulled from his inventory, Thorn put them away and opened up his messenger. \"Oberlin, what is the situation?\"\"You have been walking around with an entire library in your inventory? No wonder.\" \"What?\"\"Back in prison, I tried to pickpocket you a bunch of times to see what you had, but I only ever got books. I thought I just had the worst luck ever. But it would make sense if you had thousands of books.\"\"You tried to rob me?\"\"Yeah, but don't worry about it. We're friends now. Anyway.\" Oberlin coughed and changed the subject. \"They're about two minutes away from the city. I'm on a rooftop at the southern end of the city. If you make your way over here, we might be able to slip by. Wait, no, nevermind. They are leaving guards to watch the path back to the tunnel. We are not going to get out of this without a fight.\"\"Okay, that is fine.\"\"Fine? What do you mean fine?\" Oberlin protested. \"I can't throw people through walls or shoot lasers like some people in this group.\"\"Just let me know where they are going once they get into the city, and we'll handle it from there.\" Thorn turned to look at Velin and Mina. \"You ladies up for a brawl?\"On the edge of the city twenty red-armored players moved forward in formation. In the center of the group, Angdrin looked around at the abandoned surroundings moodily. Ever since his encounter with that giant freak in Embersplit, his luck had been horrible. It had only been a couple of days, but nothing seemed to be going his way. \"Telis, have you figured out who is messing with us here?\"\"No, sir,\" Telis responded very carefully, trying not to anger her boss any further. \"Our teams have been going down too fast. We are estimating that there is a team of at least seven assassins, if not more.\"\"What is the last count of our losses?\"\"Ten. Two at the canyon, three at the door, five in the city,\" Korith reported gruffly, his eyes never stopping as he scanned the quiet surroundings.\"Ten?\" Angdrin could feel his temples throbbing from the stress. He had enough to deal with ever since that upstart Ouroboros had gone back to the guild headquarters. The last thing he needed was his Crimson Snakes being picked off in his own backyard. \"Find out who is doing this, and bring me their heads!\"\"Yes, sir!\" Shouting together, the group picked up speed, heading in toward the street where their dead members reported contact.The long streets were silent apart from the well-ordered footsteps of the Crimson Snakes and the muted jingle of their equipment. The closer they got to the location of the reported fight the tenser the group got. A group of assassins could hurt anyone quite badly if they got the drop. With well-trained precision, the Crimson Snakes spread out, creating space for Angdrin and his lieutenants to examine the scene of the fight, along with the help of a ranger.\"What is wrong?\" Angdrin, watching the ranger scouting the area like a hawk, caught the faint frown on his face.\"Sir, it doesn't look like the work of assassins. It looks more like they got run over by a truck.\"\"What do you mean?\" \"The traces show none of the blood splatter that you would expect from assassination techniques. However, we can see where multiple people went flying as if they were hit by a charge.\" The ranger knelt and pointed to some disturbed ground. \"See, this is where someone in red armor struggled back to their feet. You can see the flecks of paint on these stones where they slid along the ground.\"\"So we are dealing with two groups?\"Opening his mouth, the ranger hesitated for a moment, taking another look around. Before he could speak, a loud sound rang out, and a barrage of ice spikes shot from an alleyway, driving an unprepared Crimson Snake to the ground. Immediately shouts erupted from the rest of the groups, and they swiftly formed ranks facing the mouth of the alley. \"Shields up!\" Korith bellowed, while beside him, Telis stepped in front of Angdrin. Within seconds the group had formed a defensive half ring in the street, their backs to a building. Angdrin stood in the middle, flanked by Telis and Korith, glaring at the alleyway. Thanks to the quick response by his men, no one else had gotten injured by the ice spikes that continued to fly toward them.\"Squad 2, advance!\"Their shields up, a group of four Crimson Snake warriors left the protection of the half circle, dashing forward to the mouth of the alley where they split, two going to each side.\"Breach!\"Shouting a battle cry, the four warriors charged into the alleyway. After a moment, the ice spikes stopped, and everything went quiet. For a second, everyone froze, their eyes fixed on the mouth of the alley.BOOOOM!Without warning, the stillness was shattered by a tremendous sound as the wall behind the Crimson Snake formation exploded into pieces, chunks of brick and mortar flying through the air. Eyes wide at the sight, the leader of the Crimson Snakes stared at the debris flying past his shoulder. A sudden fear bloomed in his heart.[Wolf Lord's Howl] Before he could react, an unearthly howl rang through the streets, stunning everyone who heard it. The long howl seemed to echo in Angdrin's soul, shaking his confidence and causing him to lose control of the spell he had just started casting. A titanic hand, its sharp claws gleaming, gripped Angdrin's shoulder as he stood, frozen, the last echos of the wolf howl reverberating in his ears. The sharp prick of the claws as they punched through his armor shook him from his stupor, and he tried to begin a chant.\"I told you we'd try this again,\" Thorn's deep voice sounded by his ear, making him choke on his words.Under the horrified gazes of the Crimson Snakes, Thorn casually lifted Angdrin into the air and smashed him onto the stone street, instantly killing him. Picking up the odds and ends that dropped, Thorn looked at the rest of the Crimson Snakes who were staring at him in shock. Flexing his fingers, Thorn grinned.\"So, are we going to do this or what?\"With a roar of rage, Korith dashed toward Thorn, his shield up in front of him. Warding him away with a palm strike, Thorn drew his tetsubo with his other hand and charged forward, laying about himself with abandon. The commotion had drawn the whole group's attention, a mistake that they paid dearly for when the furious barrage of ice spikes resumed. No slouches in their own right, the Crimson Snakes sprang furiously into action. The melee fighters advanced, their swords swinging while the casters behind them began to pepper Thorn with all sorts of spells. Enraged by having lost their leader right off the bat, they threw themselves at Thorn with wild abandon. Telis and Korith were particularly troublesome opponents. Both were highly skilled and coordinated their attacks well with the casters. Using their shields to protect themselves, they would dash towards him at the same time, creating openings for the casters to launch their spells at Thorn. Finally, annoyed by their pestering, Thorn abandoned his defenses and latched on to Telis' shield, using his tetsubo to deliver a hard strike that sent her out of the game. Feeling the bite of Korith's blade, Thorn gritted his teeth and snapped a kick sideways, sending the warrior flying once again. This time though, Thorn drew his arbalest, finishing the job with a massive bolt that pinned the Crimson Snake lieutenant to a nearby building.As the fight continued, Thorn could feel his health rapidly dropping. Though his pain tolerance was significantly higher than the average person's and his endurance was monstrous, the game corrected for it to prevent him from being an unkillable monster. That did not stop him from being a regular monster, however, and in less than ten seconds he had already sent four Crimson Snakes out of the game. A fiercely burning fireball impacted on his side, sharp pain lancing through his ribs. Gritting his teeth, Thorn tried to ignore it, but he could feel his control starting to slip away. There were simply too many stabbing blades and arcane attacks. Just as his vision started to darken around the edges, a warm light fell on him and strength surged through him! Roaring with glee, Thorn turned and jumped, landing directly in front of the mage who cast the fireball, smashing him into motes of light with his tetsubo.\"He's got a healer!\" Panicked cries rang out from the Crimson Snakes. \"Find them! Take down the healer!\"Unfortunately for them, Velin was well hidden in a second story room, peeking from a crack in the shuttered windows. Since she was only casting healing spells on Thorn, who was rampaging below, it was nearly impossible for the Crimson Snakes to find her, and by the time they gave up, another six of them had fallen to Thorn's tetsubo or the vicious ice spikes that continued to pour out of the alley.Every time Thorn's health got low, light would burst around him, healing his wounds and filling him with energy. Unable to find the healer or bring Thorn down, the Crimson Snakes soon fell into complete disarray. It took only a few more moments for Thorn to finish them off, and soon he stood, panting, in the middle of an empty street.\"Wow, that was crazy!\" Mina came running out of the alley where she had hidden as she cast her ice spikes. \"You took on all of them by yourself!\"\"No, you helped. And Velin helped a lot too. I almost died twice.\" Thorn sighed and patted his chest. \"That was pretty scary for a second.\"\"Still, you killed Angdrin like it was nothing. I bet he is super mad right now. Probably breaking everything in sight. Hahaha, serves him right.\"\"You know Angdrin?\"\"Yeah, he is a total jerk. The Crimson Snakes were our primary opponents in Ragnarok. He is slippery and deceitful, but the Crimson Snakes are considered one of the stronger groups. Seeing you smash him into the ground like that was really satisfying!\"Watching Mina chat happily as she busied herself with picking up the odds and ends that the Crimson Snakes had dropped, Thorn could not help but smile. The strangeness between them had started to fade, and he was relieved to see her going back to her old behavior around him. After a few moments, he saw Velin coming out of the building where she had been hiding.\"Thanks for the healing. That was really clutch.\"\"Of course, that is what I'm here for.\" Velin smiled, her eyes bright. \"Once we've picked everything up, let's get back to Berum. Without a doubt Angdrin is calling for backup at this moment. He will try to trap us here until he can log back in.\"\"Alright,\" Thorn grinned widely as he flexed his fingers again. \"I think Oberlin said there were some guards at the gate, so we might have to rush through.\"Thorn's excitement at the prospect of getting to fight more Crimson Snakes was infectious, causing the girls to laugh as he swept them both up and took off running. As Thorn charged through the city, Oberlin sent him directions, guiding him to the spot where the thief was hiding. About to put the girls down, Thorn felt Mina smack his head in excitement. \"I just had the greatest idea! Why don't you just run past the bad guys and I'll shoot them with my spells? It will be like a tank!\"\"Or a two headed Ogre!\" Oberlin chimed in from a nearby balcony. With a jump, he landed lightly beside Thorn and skillfully scrambled up onto Thorn's massive back.\"Who are you calling an ogre?\"\"Thorn, of course,\" Oberlin shifted smoothly, ignoring Mina's pointed look. \"The Crimson Snakes that were left to watch the entrance are in a straight line from here to the door. Mina's idea is actually a good one, though. If you just run by, she can freeze them. We only need to delay them long enough to make it through the door.\"\"Alright, let's give it a try.\" Thorn nodded and crouched slightly as he got ready to charge. With a boom, he shot forward, his tree-trunk-sized legs carving divots in the ground as he launched himself forward. Each step sent him hurtling faster, his speed increasing quickly. The others held on tightly as he ran, afraid of being shaken off by his jarring steps.As they approached the first of the watching Crimson Snakes, Mina cast her spell.\"[Sub Zero]!\"Instantly, the horrified face of the guard froze solid as he stopped in place. Thorn, unable to stop his momentum barreled right over the Crimson Snake warrior, smashing into him like a freight train. As the unfortunate warrior dispersed into twinkling lights, Thorn nearly tripped and fell on his face, barely catching himself with one of his hands.\"Oh wow. That was... uh...\" Mina stared, wide eyed, at the spot where the warrior had stood.\"Yeah, maybe lets not do that again.\" Oberlin's voice was weak.Agreeing on a slower approach, the four players made their way out of the hidden valley, soon emerging in the canyon. As they left the cave, they could see evidence of a massive fight littering the canyon floor.\"It looks like the kobolds came back and attacked whoever was guarding here. They must have cleared out the rest of the Crimson Snakes.\"\"Well, let's get going. We don't want to get caught up in any unnecessary fights. Besides,\" Velin glared at Thorn, \"we still have to go dig through a library.\"\"Haha, yeah. Sorry about that.\" Thorn avoided her gaze sheepishly. He really had forgotten that he had looted the library the first time he went to the hidden city. His inventory was so big that he honestly just threw things in and forgot about them. As the group made its way back to Berum, Thorn made a mental note to go through everything he had and organize it.", "With a long sigh, Thorn stared at the massive piles of random loot heaped on the floor of the room he was renting. Over in the corner, Velin was poring over a stack of books that Thorn had pulled out of his inventory. While retrieving the books that he had picked from the library in Davyos' Fall, Thorn realized that he had never dealt with the various things he had picked up in the dungeon where he had met Hati. He continued to pull books, skins, gems, weapons, and other random loot that he had stored when he was a porter from his inventory, causing both Oberlin and Mina to stare in utter astonishment. Mina knew that his inventory was large, but the endless stream of loot was almost too much.\"Alright, let's sort all of this stuff,\" Thorn said, looking around at the haphazard piles, \"and then we'll see what we can sell.\"\"What are we doing with the books?\" Oberlin asked, gingerly running his hand across the top of a stack of books almost as tall as he was.\"\"Keeping them. We can store them in the bank,\" Velin called out from the desk, her eyes never leaving the page she was translating. \"But the rest of the stuff can go.\" After a few hours of sorting, the floor had reappeared, and Thorn's inventory was organized into neat sections. A trip to the bank and a couple different merchants' shops made a massive dent in his pile of junk and added a nice weight to his wallet.On the way back to the inn where Mina and Velin were waiting, Thorn was lost in thought. Following him, Oberlin stuck to Thorn's shadow. The crowded city streets were normally hard to push through, but Thorn's massive figure seemed to have a magical effect on the crowds who naturally made a path for him.A couple blocks from the inn, Thorn slowed to a stop and crouched in the shade of a building. Seeing him stop, Oberlin stood close, waiting as Thorn continued to think quietly.\"How would you feel about helping me out with something?\" Thorn's deep voice rumbled like thunder, even when he was trying to speak softly.\"You name it. I can't tell you how grateful I am for your help with the Ordo Serpentes.\"\"Don't worry about that. It turned out to be something good for me too. I want to hire you to do something. The job will be for at least a year, maybe longer.\"\"You want to hire me?\"\"Yeah, formal employment. I'm thinking about building a team, and I could use someone who understands how to find information.\"\"Well, I can certainly help with that. But I don't know if you realize the extent of what is required for building an official team. You have to pay the members of the team. And not just with in-game stuff, but with real money. And you have to provide health care and pay taxes and all sorts of other things.\"\"Yeah, I read a guide.\"\"It is a cool idea, but unless you have a sponsor, you'll go broke trying to get the funds together.  I don't mean to be a downer, but putting together an official team is very costly and a lot of work.\" Oberlin shook his head. \"I'd be happy to put together an informal team with you, but I don't know how realistic it is to expect anything of it.\"\"We have a sponsor.\" Thorn watched the crowded street as he waited for his words to register.\"Getting a sponsor is the hardest... What?!\"\"We have a sponsor.\" Thorn repeated his words dully, pretending that he wasn't thoroughly enjoying Oberlin's shock. \"How did you find a sponsor? How big a team are they willing to finance? Are they willing to build a full guild? How much are they offering?\" Excited, Oberlin blurted out a whole string of questions before his expression turned puzzled. \"Who are they?\"\"Atlas.\" \"Atlas? Atlas Energy?!\"Opening his interface, Thorn sent Oberlin a message with a document attached.\"That is the employment contract. If you are interested, you'll be hired for a term of one year. While there are no specific roles in the contract, I currently envision your role being something similar to an intelligence officer. I am looking for someone who can assist me in collecting, sorting, and ranking intelligence while also helping me make contacts.\"I'm realizing that Nova Terra is way larger and more complex than I originally understood. This world is not a game, at least in the normal sense, and I think it is time to stop treating it as such. I have a quest that could potentially lead to controlling a region, and I want to capitalize on it by putting a team together that will eventually transition into a guild that will use that region as a base. I don't know the specifics of where I am going to end up, but I can guarantee that I'm going to leave my mark on this world, and I would love to have you join me.\"For a moment, Oberlin was silent, his eyes growing wider and wider as he read the document that Thorn had sent over to him. Seeing the official letterhead of Atlas, the thief's heart nearly stopped. As soon as he finished reading it, he signed it and sent it back to Thorn.\"Sounds good, boss. You got yourself an employee.\"\"Thanks. I know all of this is sudden, but we've got a lot to do. For your first task, I'd like you to head south to make some specific connections. I'll send you the exact details when you are on the road.\"Saying goodbye, Thorn watched Oberlin vanish into the crowd. He sat in the shade of the wall for a few more minutes, watching people pass by. His whole life he had been an observer, and it was finally time that he stood up and began to take control of his life for himself. Rising, Thorn smiled. He had a feeling that the next few years of his life in-game were going to be eventful. Laughing happily to himself, Thorn joined the crowds.The girls were sitting together in the room when Thorn got back. Velin had finished examining the books and maps that Thorn had looted from the library and compiled all of the new information into notes.\"Did you find out where the keep is located?\" Thorn sat on the floor by the table.\"I did. It looks to be about three days east of here. The history of the region is quite complicated. We will need to tread carefully, as the enemies will most likely be quite dangerous. May I ask how you got the quest?\"\"It triggered after I got a title. Is that important?\"\" Absolutely. Rather, it would be more accurate to say that it is highly likely that it is important. Almost everything in this game is important. I'll try to do a bit more research to see if it will influence our approach. If all you have to do is clear the keep, we should be okay, but complicated areas like this one tend to generate a lot of quests, which could put us into conflict with other players. High density quest areas like this will be fiercely contested if there are any teams or guilds involved.\"\"I'm sure we'll be able to handle it.\" Hearing a knock on the door, Thorn paused. \"That will be the food. Let's eat and chat about all this after dinner.\"Opening the door revealed four waiters straining under massive trays of food. On his way up to the room, Thorn had ordered enough food to feed an army. Or just himself.After the four servers carried the gargantuan trays of food into the room, Thorn, Mina, and Velin ate their fill. As the girls chatted quietly, Thorn carried the mound of plates and bowls down to the kitchen. As he returned, he heard the conversation die down. Ever since his transformation into the Avatar of the Moon Wolf, his senses had gotten much sharper, and while he could not tell exactly what the girls had been talking about, he knew that it wasn't a happy conversation.Ducking through the door, Thorn saw Mina looking glumly at the floor. Velin's expression was neutral, but that did not mean anything since she almost always looked like that. Sitting down on the floor, Thorn organized his thoughts for a moment before he began to speak.\"I think it is time we had a serious talk.\" \"A...about what?\" Mina looked up, the frustration on her face replaced with nervousness.\"About what we are going to do next.\" Thorn tried to smile reassuringly. \"You can't just follow me around while I do quests. I think that we need to define our working relationship. No, wait, hear me out before you say anything.\" Holding up his hand to prevent Mina from speaking, Thorn took a deep breath.\"I've been thinking a lot about Nova Terra and what I am hoping to achieve in this world. I won't pretend that I have everything figured out, but recent events have started making my path clearer. I want to lay out my thoughts and then hear yours. No matter what conclusion we come to, I want to remain friends, but that does not necessarily mean that we have to quest together. That said, I'd love to stay together. Sorry, I'm getting scattered.\"My eventual goal is to carve out a piece of Nova Terra for myself. I've been thinking about this a lot ever since we faced off against the Crimson Snakes. The way they play is very intriguing to me. Building up a territory, leading other people, growing influence. All of these parts of the game really appeal to me, but I am not naive enough to think that I can do all this by myself. \"I want to start a team. An official team like Ouroboros had before. Actually, I've already started a team, and Oberlin has joined it. I'd love to have you two join the team as well. I have a sponsor already, and I'm working out the details for it, but I think it would be really awesome for both of you to join.\"\"We'd lo...\" Before Mina could finish her statement, Velin quickly covered her mouth.\"Thank you for your offer, Thorn. We would love to hear more details about this.\" Velin kept her hand over her short friend's mouth.\"Haha, sure. I've just sent you the employment contracts. The team sponsor is Atlas Energy, and the budget is generous. I'm not one hundred percent set on what the team's primary goal is at this point. Why don't you take a moment to read through the contract, and I can try to answer any questions you have?\"For a few moments, silence reigned as Mina and Velin read through the file that Thorn sent them. At first, Mina looked over it casually, but the contents soon left her mouth hanging open in shock. Velin had brought out her notebook to write down her questions, but it lay forgotten at her side as her eyes widened in surprise. Neither girl said a word until they had finished reading over the document. Even after they finished, they simply stared at each other for a moment.\"Is this real?\" Velin's voice was quiet.\"Yeah.\" Thorn frowned. \"Why wouldn't it be?\"\"You expect me to believe that Atlas is offering us a contract on their official team?!\" Mina shouted.\"Ah, yeah. I know someone in the company.\" Thorn's face broke into a smile. \"I mean, I think the conditions are pretty good.\"\"Pretty good is not even close. Generous pay, paid relocation, a ridiculous benefits package that includes housing and a state-of-the-art pod for long term immersion? Team share options and living space in Fantasia? All attached to a self-defined contract period and a severance package? This is an offer straight out of a fantasy for a professional player.\" Velin's voice was flat.\"Ah,\" Thorn scratched his head. He had asked his aunt for a standard elite player's contract and had polished up a few of the areas he felt were not quite up to scratch to try and make it more attractive. On further reflection, maybe he had made it a bit too attractive.\"Honestly, this looks outstanding.\" Velin looked squarely at Thorn. \"But it is only fair to tell you that we don't come without issue.\" Glancing at Mina, whose frown had returned, Velin smiled bleakly. \"Ever since we got out of Hati's Ascent, things have gone terribly for us. At first it was just strained relationships inside the group, but over the last couple weeks, it has gotten worse. A lot worse.\"When you met us, Mina and I were professional players registered to Ragnarok's third team, led by Ouroboros. That team was disbanded and our contracts, along with Jorge's, were terminated. On top of that, our housing contract was terminated, as well, and all of our accounts were frozen, citing a criminal investigation.\"\"They said the building was being used for trafficking illegal substances.\" Mina's tone was hollow.\"Who said that?\"\"The city inspectors who came to notify us that our building was being condemned. We've been living in an Internet Cafe for the last two days, but I think we are about to get kicked out.\" Velin sighed again. \"So much has happened all in a row that it is pretty obvious that someone has it out for us. Someone with a lot of pull. I don't know if they are targeting us because of Ragnarok or just because we were close to Ouroboros, but I don't want to bring trouble to you.\"\"This all started two weeks ago?\"\"Two weeks in game, two days real time.\"\"Ah, right.\" Thorn nodded. Since he spent all his time in game, it was easy to forget that time in the real world passed differently. \"You don't need to worry about it, I am not afraid of trouble.\"\"This is serious, Thorn. Whoever it is has serious connections in our city government. I don't want to drag you into our mess. We have already ruined your life enough.\"\"I'm serious as well. Atlas is not afraid of anyone, no matter how many connections they have. You can have confidence that Atlas will have your back. I'm happy to add a protection clause, if it will help.\"There was something magnetic about Thorn's deep, calm voice that caused Mina to believe him completely. Without waiting for Velin, she signed the contract and sent it back to Thorn. Velin only took a couple more quiet moments before she signed it as well.\"Welcome to the party.\" Grinning, Thorn stood up. \"I've got to make a call, but I'll be right back. Our first order of business will be to come up with a concrete plan for our current quest. Excuse me one second.\"Leaving the room, Thorn's grin changed to a frown. Mina and Velin's rapidly escalating situation was too coincidental. He walked down the stairs and asked one of the waiters for a private room. Though the furniture was too small for him to sit down, it was quiet and, most importantly, sound-proofed. \"Hey, kid!\" Julia popped up on his messenger app almost as soon as he hit the call button.\"Aunt, did you do something to that party I was with?\" \"Uh, um. No?\" Julia's eyes shifted for a moment until, unable to stand Thorn's stare, she threw up her hands in defeat. \"Okay, maybe. I might have dropped a couple hints here and there. But they deserved it. As far as I am concerned, they are getting off easy!\"", "Frustrated, Thorn could only glare at his aunt. With the amount of power available at her fingertips, it was silly to expect that she would not leverage it to get what she wanted. It was even sillier for Thorn to pretend that he was not tempted to do the same. While he had ambitions of crafting his destiny with his own hands, he was not foolish enough to ignore the advantage that Atlas afforded to him.Still, he was uncomfortable using the weight of the company to squash those that displeased him. \"I thought I told you that I would deal with it.\" Thorn sighed, rubbing the back of his head.\"How could you deal with it?\" Even thinking about what had happened to Thorn got Julia steamed. \"What they did was unacceptable, and there is no way I can let them off scott-free. No one is allowed to hurt you like that.\"Seeing that Julia was in full mom mode, Thorn held his tongue and let her vent for a few minutes. After it sounded like she had gotten most of the venom out of her system, Thorn smiled.\"Aunt, I understand what you are saying, but I would like it if you could let me handle this. Actually, I've been questing with two of them recently, and I was thinking of recruiting them to my team.\"\"The girls, right?\" Julia's eyes narrowed dangerously. \"Yes. Mina and Velin are their names. Look, I feel loved knowing you have my back, but I don't want to make a big deal about what happened. I've thought a lot about this, and I think it would be best to just get it behind me. At least, as much as I can.\"\"You are just forgiving them? That's it? I don't know that I can support that. Just because they are girls, it doesn't mean you have to let them get away with murder. They tried to kill you and stole from you. I say you should make them pay.\"\"Honestly, I would have agreed with you a couple weeks ago.\" Thorn sighed, rubbing his nose. \"But then I started thinking about what I actually want from life, and being consumed by anger isn't it. I know it sounds crazy, but when I started planning my revenge, that is all I could think about. It took over my thoughts and made me angry all of the time. That is not the type of person you raised me to be.\"Look, it isn't like I am happy that they threw me under the bus, but I can't deny that it helped me grow up. At least a little bit. My first foray into having friends of my own ended terribly, but I don't have to let that define me, right? I am more than my pain, I am more than my body. You taught me that. My body bends to my will, not I to it.\" Pausing to gather his thoughts, Thorn stared down at his hands as Julia waited quietly, watching him from other side of the call.\"At the end of the day, my feelings are like my pain. They are like my body. Sometimes terrible things happen. And sometimes I'm an idiot and don't see them coming. Or maybe I willfully ignore them because I really want friends. But I don't have to let my feelings pick my path. I don't know. I guess I'm saying that I want to try it again, but on my own terms. Believe me,\" he said, lifting his head and looking his aunt squarely in the eyes, his voice taking on a hint of steel. \"I will not let something like that happen again.\"\"Alright, alright. I understand. I will take the pressure off.\" Julia waved her hand, smiling fondly at Thorn. \"Oh, wait. What about that Ouroboros guy. He got a four-category class at your expense. He is well protected by his family, but I was about to start putting the screw to them.\" \"I'll deal with Ouroboros myself.\" Thorn shook his head. \"I owe him at least a punch, but after that, I'm going to play it by ear. Besides, you can't afford to be involved in this sort of stuff, Aunt. Atlas doesn't need bad press.\"\"Haha. You are cute. I've been doing this sort of thing for years, kid. I know what I can and can't do.\"\"I'll send you the contracts Mina and Velin signed. Can I trouble you with registering my team?\"\"One sec.\" Julia scrolled through her contacts and sent one over to Thorn. \"This is your lawyer's Fantasia avatar. Just send them to him with a note, and he can do everything you need. Have you decided on a name?\"\"I'm thinking Titan or something like that.\"\"Titan is already taken. Honestly, most of the good names are taken.\" Julia looked at her nephew fondly. \"You know, kid? I just want to tell you how much I love you and how proud I am of you.\"\"Thanks, Aunt Julia. I love you, too.\"After the call ended, and Thorn had sent Oberlin, Velin, and Mina's contracts to his lawyer with a note, he sat for a couple moments in silence. Meeting Josephine, the  Avatar of Salliish, and butting heads with Angdrin of Ragnarok's Crimson Snakes had started an idea brewing in Thorn's head. Seeing other players treating Nova Terra as a world to be explored and conquered, he could not help but feel the bite of adventure.If others could take over areas, why shouldn't he? If others could set up massive, far-reaching, secret societies, why couldn't Thorn? He was not one hundred percent clear on what it was that he wanted to build, but the more he learned about the quest he was on, the clearer his path became.\"One thing at a time,\" Thorn reminded himself before standing and heading back upstairs.In the room, Mina was chatting away, a glimmer of hope shining in her eyes. The recent events in the real world had dampened her natural enthusiasm, but she was bouncing back quickly. Velin, on the other hand, remained somber as she racked her brain for a solution to the issues that were plaguing her and Mina in the real world. Despite the fact that she had signed the contract, she did not want to involve Thorn if she did not have to.*ding*Mina froze, her face turning white as she looked at Velin. Seeing a message in her inbox from the bank, she opened it, the slight trembling in her hands betraying her nervousness. The longer she read, the wider her eyes became as color came rushing back into her face.\"Ahhhhh! Velin, look at this! Look at this! The bank unfroze my account?! And they deposited the signing bonus! That means we don't have to stay at the cafe anymore!\"*ding*\"Wait, here is another message. It's from the city inspection office! Our apartment has been unsealed! We can go home! Or buy a new home!\" Mina was so excited she was nearly panting. \"Can you believe how quickly things turned around? I mean, we just signed the contract, like, twenty minutes ago! What a crazy coincidence for the inspection to be over too.\"\"Yeah,\" Velin could not suppress a sigh of relief. \"Quite the coincidence. Mina, we will need to do our best in our new jobs, okay? No messing around.\"\"Ha, when do I ever mess around?\" Mina spun around as the door opened. Seeing Thorn's large figure, she pounced forward and hugged his waist as best she could. Taken aback, Thorn looked to the Elven War Priestess, who just smiled and shrugged. \"Thorn! You wouldn't believe what happened! I'm so happy. Our accounts were unfrozen and our apartment building opened back up! We don't have to stay in the cafe anymore! Ahhh!\" Letting go of him, Mina danced around the room in excitement before collapsing on the bed that had been pushed against the wall.\"Thorn, thank you.\" Once Mina had calmed down, Velin stood up and bowed slightly.\"No problem.\" Thorn waved his hand. \"Not a big deal. I'm happy to help.\"\"We have both discussed it, and we are going to take up the offer of relocation, so we'll be out of the game for a while. It should only take a day or so to move with a moving company, but we will not be able to log in during that time.\"\"Yeah, it will be good to move to a new place.\" Mina chimed in.\"Since you'll be out of the game for a week or so, I thought I could go ahead and scout the valley out. Oberlin will be meeting us there, as he has a couple things to do in the south.\" Thorn scratched his head. The whole time dilation thing made it awkward for him since he was permanently logged in.\"Alright.\" Velin closed her eyes for a moment and took a deep breath. \"Why don't we talk about the quest.\"\"What did you find out?\"\"As I mentioned before, the area is about three days from here to the east. From the few records I could find, it seems that there is some sort of corruption that has established itself in the valley, making it relatively inhospitable. My recommendation is that you proceed with caution. Your quest aside, I think there is a high possibility that if we search the valley, we might be able to find an inheritance quest. In fact, I would not be surprised if your quest is the introduction to a chain inheritance quest. I found six reported quests that match this schema.\"\"Schema?\"\"Yes, since all the quests in Nova Terra are unique, it is impossible to find an exact match. However, over time, players have noticed patterns in the way quests are given, structured, and completed. This fits the bill for an inheritance quest, but it is distinct in that it is not a class quest but a title quest. Most inheritance quests revolve around inheriting a class or a treasure associated with a quest. The six specific quests I found in Ragnarok's database that matched this were also based on a title, and every one of them had to do with inheriting a place rather than a thing.\"\"You mean, like a castle?\" Mina asked, sitting up on the bed.\"Yes. Though none of them gained anything bigger than a shop in the capital.\" \"How do you have access to Ragnarok's database?\" Thorn asked. \"I thought you left the guild?\"\"I built the database.\" Velin flashed a sly smile. \"Even without being in the guild, they have no chance of keeping me out without rebuilding the whole thing. Plus, I have my own backups, just in case they do rebuild it.\"\"Ah. Gotcha. Sorry for interrupting.\"\"No problem. As I was saying, the largest gain from the quests was a sizable shop in the capital, and renting it out has made the player who completed the quest a millionaire in real life. In fact, all six of the players or groups who finished these quests have gained substantial wealth from their quest rewards. Owning property in Nova Terra is rare, and even rarer if we ignore the guild halls that cities make available to the guilds.\"\"We're going to get a castle!\" Mina cheered.\"Well, we don't know if this quest will actually lead to owning property, so we need to make sure that we find the quest that does when we are in the valley. Additionally, we have to find it before anyone else does.\"\"Do you think there are other players in the valley?\"\"Probably not at this point. The area is pretty rural, but I'm worried about the Crimson Snakes. Angdrin is one of the three major power players in Ragnarok and is in control of this whole region. The top three forces in Ragnarok are currently fighting over the guild master's seat. Angdrin controls the Crimson Snakes while Sylith, a Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight, leads a faction called the Silver Guard.\"Ouroboros has joined the fight recently by establishing the Blood Guard using the class change stones that he gained from Karrandras. All three of the groups are competing for the guild leader's seat by comparing their gains in the game. All that to say, Angdrin is going to be on the lookout for any new area opening up. If he can add it to his territory, he will gain a huge advantage over the other two.\"This means that he has scouts checking out every possible new area that they can find. I'm guessing that he already has a hint about it, which would explain why he was locking down Davyos' Fall. He should be looking for the quest that will grant ownership of land in the valley, and, if he gets it, we'll have a serious fight on our hands.\"\"You keep talking about how controlling an area is really good. Can you talk me through the benefits?\" Thorn felt like he was still struggling to grasp the whole picture.\"Of course. Let's say that we've formed a guild, and we are going to set up shop here in Berum. Our first option is to rent a space from the city. That costs us money, and while we can recoup those losses and even turn a profit if we are smart, we will always have the cost of rent to worry about. However, if we owned some land in the city, we would be able to build whatever we wanted, zoning permitting. Without having to worry about the rent payment, or having a landlord, we would have a lot more control and profit.\"Now, imagine that we owned the city of Berum. Not only could we turn it into anything we wanted, but we could also rent out the land to other guilds or groups who wanted to develop businesses in the city. When you start to factor in things like respawn fees, taxes on the citizens, tariffs on goods being brought into the city, and licenses for hunting or gathering material it can pile up quickly.\" \"Ouroboros used to say that if you controlled the castle, you controlled the people.\" Mina got off the bed and walked to the window.\"He was right.\" Velin nodded. \"The biggest advantage of ownership in Nova Terra is the relationship it gives you with the natives. For whatever reason, natives pay a lot more attention to players who have a stake in their community or authority granted by the game.\"\"So, owning property sort of legitimizes your existence to the natives?\" Thorn mused.\"That is exactly right. And if we can get ownership in the valley, we will have a large advantage over other teams and can maybe look at setting up a guild.\"\"What is the difference? I thought guilds were just large teams?\"\"Not really. There are a number of different official organizations that the game recognizes. Each has a different function. Teams allow players to jointly accept any non-solo quest. Normal guilds are technically collections of teams that own a piece of property. Mercenary Corps are specialized guilds that takes part in player generated requests as well as native requests. Armies are a guild that works for a native who holds power. Finally, there are Merchant Groups, which are guilds based around trading, and Orders, which are guilds that focus on a particular set of rules. They could be religiously based or just social. With just four of us, we'd be considered a team. We'll need to add more players or natives to our organization to make a guild.\"\"Natives can join guilds?\"\"Yup. That is how Velin got her class.\" Mina nodded. \"It was passed down from the Holy Crimson Cardinal that Ragnarok recruited. He is a native that teaches players related classes. He lives at the headquarters.\"\"Interesting. So what about an organization like the Order Serpentes?\"\"Secret societies could be a native organization, or they could be a player guild. The game does a good job of blending them, so it can be hard to tell if a guild is owned by players or has been generated by the game.\"\"Huh.\" Thorn looked up at the ceiling for a moment, occupied with his thoughts. \"If we want to build a guild, then we'll need more people.\"\"Not just that.\" Velin sent Thorn a file. \"Guilds need three things. People, Purpose, and Prosperity.\"\"Prosperity?\"\"She means money. But money doesn't start with a 'P'.\" Mina chuckled.\"Prosperity is more than money,\" Velin protested, giving Mina a reproving glance. \"Guilds need success in what they do. They have to motivate their members, or they will fall apart. People and purpose are self-explanatory, but prosperity is probably the most important piece of the puzzle. Prosperity attracts new members while purpose will come as those players take on tasks in Nova Terra and begin to shape the world around them.\"\"Hmm. I'll have to think about this.\"\"There is no rush. As our group grows, I'm sure these things will become clear.\" Velin closed her notebook with a snap as she stood. \"Now, we should log out and start our move. The sooner we move to our new place, the sooner we can be back to help clear the keep.\"", "\"Whew.\" Thorn wiped imaginary sweat from his brow as he looked back over the trees that stretched to the horizon. The forest was eerily silent, causing the sound of his footsteps to seem unnaturally loud. Ever since he had gotten within fifteen miles of the valley, the unnatural silence had settled as the sounds of insects and small animals disappeared. Even the wind seemed scared to approach, causing an unsettling stillness in the air. Glancing around at the trees that had been his only company for the last three days, Thorn couldn't help but miss Mina and Oberlin's constant chatter. Even Velin's stoicism would be better than this oppressive silence. He had almost started talking to himself to break the strange feeling that crawled up his spine.The party had split up in Berum three days ago after their adventure in the abandoned city and their conflict with the Crimson Snakes. To save time, Thorn traveled toward the keep while Mina and Velin logged out to change their housing arrangements. Agreeing to meet up once they were back in game, they said their goodbyes and Thorn forged on ahead, arriving at this silent forest. The terrain had been steadily rising for the last day, and he could see that he was quickly approaching a large mountain range. If Velin's conjectures were correct, then Greymane Keep was located in the valley on the other side of the mountains.Breaking out into a jog, he began to cover ground quickly and, feeling no drain on his stamina, kicked his speed up a notch. Soon Thorn was practically flying up the mountain, each stride carrying him almost a dozen feet. Trees flew by in a blur of greens and browns as his speed slowly increased. Within half an hour, he had covered most of the distance to the peak of the mountain and could see the snow-capped summit sticking up over the trees. Unfortunately, catching a glimpse of the snow peeking above the trees distracted Thorn enough that he wasn't watching his footing and, stepping into a small dip in the ground, he lost his balance. He hit the ground rolling, smashing straight into a large tree so hard that it fell to the ground with a thunderous crash, its trunk directly broken off.Groaning in pain and clutching his back, Thorn tried to stand to his feet only to hear an odd chittering sound coming from under the tree that he had just knocked over. Squeaks of anger and pain poured out from under the tree in an unrelenting torrent and, worried that he had hurt someone, Thorn pushed the pain in his back out of his mind, grabbed the tree trunk, and lifted it up with one hand.Greeting him was an absolutely furious little, furry creature. It didn't look to be injured, but it was certainly angry, a fact it reinforced by jumping at Thorn with its teeth and claws bared. Despite being startled at the sudden attack, Thorn managed to catch the little creature with one hand where it scratched and bit furiously. Unsure at this sudden turn of events, Thorn was about to try and throw the creature off when he realized that the little monster wasn't actually hurting him, as its teeth couldn't pierce his skin. It was also quite cute, like a small red panda with multiple tails. A pretty pattern made up of three diamonds on its forehead made it look like it was wearing a small crown. Right now it was doing its best to chew through Thorn's gauntleted fingers. Afraid it would hurt itself, Thorn quickly unsummoned his gloves, allowing the small creature to gnaw on his fingers to its heart's content.When it became apparent that its efforts to remove Thorn's fingers were futile, the creature abandoned the attempt, instead climbing up onto Thorn's shoulder and shaking its little fist at his face while it scolded him. Moving carefully, Thorn pulled an apple out of his inventory and offered it. Snatching it quickly and holding it in its mouth, the creature scampered down Thorn's tall body, jumping onto one of the trees he had uprooted in his tumble.Sitting on its hind legs, it used its front paws to hold the apple while it munched on it, still grumbling in between bites while throwing Thorn dirty looks. Amused, Thorn brought out more food and sat down as well. Opening up his messaging system, Thorn looked for someone who was online, finally settling on Mina's icon.\"Hey, Thorn, did you find the castle yet? I just logged in, and I am waiting for Velin before we come your way. Oberlin said he would be a couple more days. Did he tell you?\"\"Yeah, we talked. Hey, I have a question. Do you know what this is?\" Thorn flipped the camera forward facing, revealing the grumpy creature which had finished the apple and was now eating the rest of Thorn's food as if it was the most natural thing in the world.\"Oh, you found an ailuridae. An uncommon, royal ailuridae at that!\"\"Royal ailuridae?\"\"Yeah, it's like a red panda. But you can tell how rare it is by its number of tails. One tail is common, two is uncommon, three is rare. Do you see the symbol on its face? That is how you can tell it is a royal creature. You should bind it as a pet and then give it to me!\" Mina's eyes glowed as she gazed at the fluffy creature. \"It is so cute.\"Seeing that Thorn was looking over, the Ailuridae shook its fist at him again, obviously still mad.\"Haha, what did you do? It looks like it is mad at you. Look how cute it is!\"\"Yeah. I might have knocked over its home. How do I bind it as a pet?\"\"There are a couple ways to tame creatures, the simplest being to pay an Animal Trainer to do it for you. You can also use Pet Cards from the shop to tame creatures. They are considered vanity items, so they will appear in your inventory immediately. In theory, if you could make the animal like you enough, it will offer a contract on its own, but that is really rare. I would use a Pet Card, if I were you.\"Opening up the cash shop interface, Thorn searched around and clicked on the pet shop window. A semi-transparent screen covered Thorn's vision, asking him if he wanted to travel to the pet shop or open it in windowed mode. \"Mina, what does it mean about traveling to the pet shop?\"\"You've never used the shop?\" Mina's mouth dropped open in an exaggerated manner.\"No, I've never needed to.\" Thorn ignored her mockery.\"Well, if you are outside of combat, you can go to any of the vanity shops. It takes you there mentally, but your body stays where it is. But that way you can get your vanity items and equip them immediately.\"\"Isn't that dangerous? What if you get attacked or something?\"\"Not really. I mean, I guess it could be. Just don't use it while you are in danger. Plus, there is a little bell thingy that will let you know if something is happening in Nova Terra. The shops are in Fantasia, so if you are worried, you can just log out of the game and go there. Or open up in windowed mode. You're the size of a mountain, Thorn, don't be a sissy.\"\"Thanks, Mina.\" Ignoring her bantering, Thorn ended the call and clicked on the button to open the shop in windowed mode. The see-through window solidified, floating in front of Thorn like a virtual video screen. Inside, he could see the shop.At the moment, it was empty except for a middle aged woman sitting behind a glass case. Shelving covered the walls holding a massive amount of cards, each with the picture of a different creature on it and a colored border. There were red cards along the bottom of the wall, blue cards at about waist height, and a line of silver cards at head height. In the case in front of the woman were gold bordered cards and a couple black bordered cards. \"Hello, sir, how can I help you?\" asked the woman, smiling at Thorn through the screen.\"I have an animal here I would like to register as a battle pet.\" Thorn pointed at the Ailuridae, which was still muttering in between bites of food.\"Oh my,\" gasped the woman. \"That is an Ailuridae. A royal Ailuridae!\" Quickly, she stood and placed a thin block of wood on the counter. \"Put it in the containment field, quick!\" The block of wood lit up with a circle of blue runes which projected a glowing sphere into the air.Puzzled, Thorn looked at her through the screen and then looked at the small, furry creature. Seeing his confusion, the lady covered her mouth and laughed.\"Sir, you can just put it through the window.\"Curious, Thorn stuck his hand through the screen, almost immediately making contact with the wooden counter in the shop. Surprised, he pulled his hand back and stared at the window. It was like two completely different realities were superimposed on one another, with only this square hole connecting them. Shaking his head, he turned his attention back to the matter at hand, reaching out for the small creature. Catching it proved to be more of a challenge than he expected, however, and after a few fruitless minutes of trying and failing, Thorn stepped back. The furry creature, obviously pleased with itself, preened and managed to look down its tiny nose at Thorn, despite the incredible height difference.Smirking, Thorn pulled a pastry out of his inventory, crouching down to hold it out. Slowly he coaxed the furry creature closer, tempting it with the freshly baked smell. Once again, as he waited patiently for the ailuridae to take the bait, Thorn couldn't help but marvel at the convenience of an inventory. It stored his food in a perfectly preserved state, which meant that it came out as perfect as it had been when he put it in.Eventually, curiosity and greed won out, and the ailuridae slipped forward, jumping up onto Thorn's arm to snatch the sweet smelling pastry. Lighting up after the first bite, it devoured the rest of the pastry quickly and then held out a small paw, demanding more. Three pastries later, it was so preoccupied that it didn't notice when Thorn stuck it through the window into the pet shop.Thorn moved his hand into the field, feeling that the ailuridae ceased moving as it entered the area. Thorn took a moment to examine his hand but, seeing nothing strange, quickly looked back at the shopkeeper who was staring at the Ailuridae floating in the field.\"Wow, this is the first time I have ever seen an uncommon ailuridae!\" gushed the shopkeeper. \"And a royal one at that. Look, look, see the two tails? See the black stripes under its eyes? And the cute white cheeks? Ooooooh. It's just too cute!\"Thorn cleared his throat, reminding the shopkeeper that she had a customer. \"Oh, oh, please excuse me. I am Sondra, the Battle Pet Master of Fantasia. Did you want to trade in this pet for money?\"\"Actually, I'm not sure. Can you explain how this whole Battle Pet thing works?\" asked Thorn.\"Of course. Ehem. The Battle Pet system is one that allows travelers and natives of Nova Terra to tame wild animals and monsters and take them as companions. Each person can acquire one Battle Pet. As you grow, there are various ways to strengthen your Battle Pet. Every Battle Pet is ranked by color, with red being common, blue uncommon, silver rare, gold epic and black unique. Gold level pets are boss drops, and black level pets are one of a kind.\"\"What does it cost to get a pet?\"\"That depends on what color pet you want. All new pets are adjusted to match the progression of their owner so they can grow with them. The lower your progression when you get the pet, the cheaper it is, and the same is true for the color.\"\"What do you mean by progression? I thought Nova Terra didn't have a level mechanic?\"\"Oh, it doesn't. Progression refers to how close you are to mastering your current class. Battle Pets grow based on how they can support your class. So, in this case, because ailuridaes function as healers, as you progress through your class, your battle pet will gain skills that compliment you. That means they might develop offensive buffs if you are a melee fighter or defensive abilities if you are a caster.\"\"What if I don't have a class?\"\"You don't have a class? Oh, in that case, your Battle Pet will take their standard growth path, growing slowly over time until you get a class.\"\"You mentioned selling?\"\"Yes, you can sell animals you find so long as you tame them first or capture them in a Battle Pet trap. For example, an ailuridae is a silver ranked pet and can be sold for 100 gold, whereas a royal ailuridae is a gold ranked pet and goes for 500 gold per level.\"\"Hmmm,\" Thorn scratched his chin. \"What if I wanted to bind this Ailuridae as a battle pet? What would the cost be?\"\"Let me scan it and see.\" Sondra pulled a small crystal wand out from her robe and waved it over the suspended Ailuridae, and after a couple seconds a screen popped up. \"Whoa!\" gasped Sondra. \"This is a unique Ailuridae! Having a name and a title makes it a black ranked pet!\"\"And how do I bind it?\"\"Oh yes, yes. You bind a pet by paying a binding fee or by using an equally ranked card. So if you want to bind Akira here, you would need to pay me 10% of the sale price of a black ranked card, which would come to 1,500 gold.\"\"1,500 Gold? You mean that the normal price is 15,000 gold for a black ranked pet?\" Thorn was stunned at the price. \"That's incredible.\"\"I mean, each black ranked battle pet is one of a kind, after all. And a unique item or pet could be said to be priceless. In fact, you have really lucked out by finding a unique pet.\" Sondra looked enviously at the furry creature rotating slowly in the blue light.\"I think I want to have this pet bound to me,\" Thorn said, quickly converting a couple of UC in his Fantasia account into gold and pulling a stack of ten gold coins from his inventory. One of the perks of having wealth, he thought. Thorn's aunt had shown him how to deposit money into his Fantasia account. He had not tapped into it yet out of principle but now seemed like a good time to break his self-imposed restriction.\"Sure, give me a second.\" With more wand-waving, Sondra activated the wooden base, and with a twinkle, the Ailuridae disappeared, only to be replaced with a black-edged Battle Pet card. Handing it to Thorn, Sondra pointed at a small device on the counter with a needle. \"Please place a drop of blood on the card. This will bind your pet to you, and you will gain the ability to summon your pet by saying [Summon] and your pet's name. You can summon your pet for any length of time, but if it dies, you will have to wait at least 24 hours before you summon it again.\"Thanking Sondra for her help, Thorn did as she said, watching as the card disappeared, and a notification box popped up to let him know that he could now summon a pet. His mood high, Thorn activated it and grinned as a chittering ailuridae appeared on his shoulder. Different from before, the ailuridae now had three tails and a curious expression as it looked around at everything else.\"Akira Status.\" 'Master?! Master!' An excited voice rang out in Thorn's mind as Akira hopped up and down on his shoulder. 'Master, I'm Akira. I'm smart and soft and beautiful and the best! I can fight and hunt and do magic and tell people what to do, and I'm the best Ailuridae!'Bemused by the torrent of thoughts from his new pet, Thorn picked her off his shoulder and stroked her fur. \"It is nice to meet you, Akira, I am Thorn. Let's get along, okay?\"", "Later that day, Thorn stood under a large tree and looked down the length of a long valley. At the end he could barely make out a series of cliffs rising up to the grey blob that was Greymane Keep. Between him and the castle lay almost ten miles of thick woods broken by a meandering river. The relatively close forest he had been walking through seemed to give way to old growth in the valley, and tracks of large wolves quickly became common. Despite the tracks, he saw no wolves, and even Akira, who had been talking non-stop, sensed nothing. Sniffing at the tracks, Akira wrinkled her nose and jumped up on Thorn's shoulder. \"Master, those tracks smell awful. There is no way I would allow such big stinky creatures in my forest.\" Getting down, close to the ground, Thorn tried to pick up a scent. Ever since he had become an Avatar his senses had grown increasingly sharp, but he couldn't pick up any smell apart from the loamy smell of soil.\"Can you tell what sort of creature it is?\"\"It smells like a timber wolf, but really sour and bitter.\"\"Hmmm. Like this?\" Thorn pulled a corrupted wolf's tail from the depth of his inventory.\"Phew! Gross, gross, gross!\" Akira burrowed into the back of Thorn's shirt. \"Put it away! Bleh, bleh.\"\"Haha, okay, okay.\" Putting the tail away, Thorn walked down into the valley. The forest was still quiet, though Akira's mental muttering provided a break from the silence. Curious at the lack of creatures, Thorn could only assume that it was due to the presence of the corrupted wolves. He continued on his way until the forest began to thin out a bit. Akira had left his shirt and bounded ahead, zipping from tree to tree faster than Thorn's eyes could keep up, and now she ran back.\"Master, master! There are people ahead. It looks like they are hunters! Should I steal their food?! Can I?\"\"No, wait til I catch up. I want to talk to them, and stealing their food will make them mad.\" Akira pouted on his shoulder but begrudgingly pointed him toward the hunters. The group of hunters noticed Thorn about the same time that he saw them and warily readied their weapons. Dressed in rough leather and tattered fur armor, the human hunters were dirty and covered in grime, but despite their bedraggled appearance, it was evident by the amount of game at their feet that they had experienced a bit of luck in their hunt. Now, hard faced, they watched as Thorn walked forward until he was about 30 feet away, bows at the ready.\"Hold there, traveler. Who are you, and what business do you have in this forest?\" The lead hunter was obviously unsettled by Thorn's size, nervously resting his hand on his sword.\"Hello, I'm Thorn, a traveler, and I'm looking for Greymane Keep. Would you be able to direct me there?\"\"Greymane?\" the lead hunter's eyes narrowed, and he shot a glance at his companions. \"What business do you have there?\"\"I need to go there for a quest.\" \"I can direct you there, but I must warn you, it is infested with werewolves at the moment. Have you received the quest to recover the Statue of Hati?\"\"Is there a quest for that? I don't know anything about a Statue of Hati. No, I was heading there for a different reason, but I would love to get the quest, if it is available.\"\"Hmmm, I think you could get it at the town hall.\" The lead hunter relaxed his guard a bit. \"I'm Charles Mallard, Captain of the Watch in the town of Greymane. Follow us back, and you can pick up the quest.\"Walking back with the hunters took a couple hours, and while at first they watched Thorn closely, by the time the wooden palisade of the village came into sight, they seemed to have accepted that he was what he claimed. Akira was much to be thanked for this change as she lost no time in making herself acquainted with the hunters and, within a short amount of time, was trying to con them out of snacks.The village was a shabby affair, comprised of one main street with houses on either side. In the center of the village was an empty forge, a tavern covered in peeling paint, and a small building that housed the village leader's office and the jail, all arranged around a little town square. It looked like the village had been larger at one point, the broken remains of houses among the weeds silent testament.Charles brought Thorn into the center of town and stuck his head into the jail, calling, \"Thomas, we've got a traveler who wants to challenge the castle.\"\"Huh, another fool?\" responded a grumpy voice, and the door pushed open to reveal an old man leaning heavily on a cane. \"Ho, traveler. I am Thomas, head of this pile of excrement they call a village. Want to challenge the castle, eh? Can't say it is a smart idea, but we all have the right to choose our own death.\"Stomping over to Thorn, he pulled out a weathered piece of paper from his breast pocket and shoved it in Thorn's face, growling, \"Please, kind traveler, help our poor village. Our poor village has come under a curse because we lost the statue of Hati from our temple. Go to Greymane Keep and get it back from the evil werewolves that live there. I know it will be hard, but our lives depend on it. Blah blah blah.\"Hearing Thomas' totally out of character tone, Thorn couldn't help but chuckle. \"So, tell me. What do I get for clearing out the castle?\"\"Our eternal gratitude,\" responded Thomas, a mocking look in his eye.  After looking over the quest update that popped up in front of him, Thorn dismissed it and carefully considered his next course of action. According to the information that Velin had dug up on the area, Greymane was the only village in the valley, which made it strategically important. The village was located near the entrance to the valley, while the keep stood against the cliffs on the other side.While his current goal was to clear the keep and claim the throne of the Wolf Lord, Thorn did not know what to expect after that. Undoubtedly, this adventure wouldn't end with assuming the position of the Lord. Thorn had not shared the specifics of his quest with Velin and Mina, but the more he thought about it, the more likely it seemed that this was going to be a quest chain. After a moment of consideration, Thorn looked at the old man and held up his hand, showing the dark ring he had gotten off of Gargish. \"Thomas, I will not conceal my purpose from you. I defeated Gargish, the Blood Hunter, in battle and have come to claim the keep as my own. I can break the curse for you, but I need some information about the castle and the werewolves in it.\"\"Eh? You killed that monster?!\" gasped Thomas. A flame sprang into his eyes as he looked at Thorn intently. The longer he looked, the happier he got. \"Well, who knew? You might actually be able to do it, traveler. Talk to Charles. He has some supplies for dealing with the werewolves that might be helpful. And before you go, come talk to me.\"Charles was behind the faded inn, working with the other town guard to clean and dress the three deer they had brought back from their hunt. Seeing that one of the deer was still waiting to be processed, Thorn offered his help. After the work was done and everyone had washed the blood from their hands, Thorn brought up his objective of clearing the werewolves from the keep and retrieving the statue of Hati.\"That is quite the task you are taking on, traveler. Hold on one second, I might have something that will help you.\" Charles rummaged around in his bag, pulling out two colored bottles. Shaking the blue one, he said, \"This is a scent neutralizing potion. It should help you get close to the keep. You'll drink it, and it should last around four hours. This green potion is the opposite. It will attract all the werewolves in a certain area. You just pour a bit out on the ground, and they'll gather. Should be enough for five uses in there.\"\"Thanks. Can I get more of these potions? I have some friends who are coming to help me, and it would be nice to get some potions for them.\"\"Sure, we can make some more, but you'll have to collect the ingredients yourself. Here, let me write you a list. You'll need three Blue Bells, one Wolfsbane, and a Zimph root for each scent neutralization potion. The attraction potion is a bit harder to make. For that you'll have to find seven Silverleaf and one deer heart.\"\"Thanks.\" Thorn looked over the list he had been given. \"Would you be willing to sell the hearts from the deer you brought back today? I have three companions, four if you count Akira here. I'd be willing to pay well for them. Say, 10 silver per?\"\"I think that should be okay. Let me check with the others, but I don't see why that wouldn't work.\"\"Excellent. Just let me know.\" Just about to leave, Thorn turned back at the door. \"Oh, I wanted to ask, do you know where I can get a map of the area?\"\"Talk to Markus. He has the little general store at the end of the street.\" The next task was getting a room for the night, so after thanking Charles for his help, Thorn found his way to the front of the inn. The receptionist, a thin bespectacled elf, assigned him a room with the largest bed the inn had and invited him into the common room for a meal, where he found the locals enjoying their evening repast. The food was hearty, if plain, and Thorn was careful to control the amount he ate, lest he eat them out of house and home.After he finished his meal, Thorn retired to his room and sent a message to Velin, Mina, and Oberlin, letting them know that he had found the keep, and they should all gather here when they logged in. The trip from Berum took about two days, so he had plenty of time to look for potion materials.Thorn had a good sleep, despite the fact that he barely fit on the bed curled up, and woke refreshed. One of the things he appreciated the most about Nova Terra was that any sleep was good sleep. Unlike the real world, where he would often wake up throughout the night, he had never had a bad night's sleep in Nova Terra.Eating a quick breakfast of ten eggs, two loaves of bread and a giant bowl of oatmeal, Thorn decided to visit the general store as his first stop. The valley was pretty large, so a map would be helpful if he was going to be wandering all over. The general store was just as run down as the rest of the buildings, but as Thorn squeezed inside, he was surprised to find the small room meticulously cleaned and well organized. At the tinkling of the bell on the door, an older man limped out of a back room and took a seat on a stool.\"Afternoon, sir. What can I do for you?\" The old man eased his leg and scratched his grizzled chin.\"Hi, are you Markus? Charles sent me down here. I'm looking for a map of Greymane Keep, as well as one of the surrounding area,\" responded Thorn.\"Greymane Keep, huh? That is a pretty dangerous place. Quite a dangerous section of country in general. Try the second shelf up on the left. There should be a green scroll. Bring it here, would you?\" Finding the appropriate scroll, which seemed to be made out of dyed leather, Thorn brought it over to the shopkeeper, who spread it out on the table next to him. \"This is a map of the land around the castle, though you'll notice the castle isn't filled in. Never made it inside, you see. There is a ruined village right near there, about seven miles from here. The village was destroyed by the wicked werewolves who live in the castle. In fact, this whole area is dangerous because it's their hunting grounds, so I'd be careful if you have a quest over there. Maybe find a party before you go.\" Sniffing at the map and scratching his chin again, the shopkeeper continued. \"Anyway, if you want it, I can copy the map to you for 2 gold. Oh and 40 silver for a general map of the surrounding area between here and there.\"\"Yes, please.\" Thorn pulled the money out of his inventory. \"Did you make all these maps yourself? They have a ton of detail.\"\"Heh, you bet I did,\" replied Markus proudly. \"I was quite the famous cartographer before I took an ogre's mace to my left hip. But I don't regret it. Those were good times but certainly not comfortable times.\"After thanking the talkative shopkeeper again, Thorn took his leave and headed out of town. Finding a rock to sit on, Thorn pulled out his updated map and beckoned his battle pet over.\"Alright, Akira, let's make a plan. We need to find 12 Blue Bells, 4 Wolfsbane, 4 Zimph root, 28 Silverleaf, and one more deer heart. I'm going to rely on you to help me scout for this stuff, okay?\"\"Of course! I've got the best nose!\" Akira jumped up and down in excitement before leaping into the branches and bounding off.\"And...\" before Thorn could continue, she was gone, leaving him with his mouth open. With a shrug, he put away his map and stood up, dusting off his pants.*ding*Accepting Mina's call, Thorn walked after Akira while chatting.\"Hey, Thorn! We're on our way, so don't get too excited and run ahead without us! It is only Velin and me coming right now, Oberlin said he had something he had to do down to the south. Something about a deal with snakes? I don't know. He'll probably send you a message about it. Velin dug up some really interesting information about the keep; apparently it used to be something else? A temple? I don't know, I wasn't really paying attention. Haha. Here, let me add her, she can explain it to you.\"", "\"The whole situation is pretty complicated.\" Flashing a brief smile as a greeting, Velin immediately launched into her explanation when her image appeared next to Mina's in the video chat. \"I ran across a story that talked about a group called the Night Walkers. From what I could figure out, they were followers of Hati and were a monastic order based out of the area where you are currently. There was no mention of Greymane Keep, but there was a mention of the Temple of the Night, a monastery fortress from which the Night Walkers operated.\"The reason I say that this is complicated is because the leader of the fortress was also the Lord of the valley, and held a position of political importance. Anyway, what I want to say is that there may be an opportunity to pick up a class or something related to the Night Walkers, and more importantly, a class related to the Lord of the valley.\"\"Why would that be such a big deal?\" Thorn asked impassively, hiding his astonishment at Velin's conjecture. This lady was a bit too sharp sometimes.\"Land. Wolfkin are not currently a playable race, but we've seen this pattern before in Nova Terra. The game introduces a few players to the race, gives out a few quests specific to them, and then unlocks them as a playable race with a specific start area. There is huge economic advantage to controlling starter areas, especially starter areas that come with a unique race. It could turn into nothing, but if what I think is true, there are going to be a lot of guilds eyeing this area soon.\"\"Alright. Let's think of a plan. Mina said you are on your way, right?\"\"Yes. We should be there in three days.\"\"Cool, come to Greymane village when you get here. I bought a map that I'll send to you.\"Saying goodbye, Thorn could only shake his head. He had not told the elven War Priestess about his title or the content of his quest, but she had still dug up so much information it was scary. Even worse, if she could find it, it was likely that there were others who could do the same.Thorn had not given it much thought, but in the back of his mind he was worried about Angdrin and his Crimson Snakes. After two encounters that both turned out poorly for the member of Ragnarok, it seemed likely that Thorn had made an enemy. Combined with the fact that he was now running around with two former members of Ragnarok and a grudge against another one of their officers, Thorn could see himself getting into conflict with the powerful guild easily.While he had not done much research on the subject, Thorn had suspected that the quest he was on was going to end in opening up this territory for players. According to what Velin had said, the primary means of making money for guilds was controlling territory. If his instincts were correct, this path would paint a giant target on his already large back.Since all of this was only speculation at this point, Thorn put these things aside and continued his search for herbs. The forest was quiet, and Akira was staying ahead of him, jumping from branch to branch. Every once in awhile, Thorn would come across a plant that looked like an herb and would get out [The Complete Alchemist], a book that he had looted from the abandoned wolfkin city.Comparing the plant against the pictures, he would try and determine if it was worth anything. If it looked like an herb of any sort, he would carefully dig it out and store it in his inventory before continuing his search. After six hours of walking through the woods, Thorn had found 2 Wolfsbane and 3 Silverleaf. He had picked up a number of other plants that seemed valuable as well, but he was a far cry from what he needed for the potions. It was getting into the mid-afternoon, so he stopped to eat and then decided to venture a bit farther out. According to his book, both Zimph root and Blue Bells liked more sunlight, so he thought he would have better luck along the edge of the forest where the valley started to rise.The old timber of the forest was spread out enough that Thorn did not have any trouble weaving through the tall trees, allowing him to arrive at the eastern edge of the forest with plenty of daylight left. He scoured the edge of the forest, successfully digging out seven Zimph roots. Or at least, he assumed they were Zimph roots. While he had a book to compare to, he really had no experience with plants, so he was sort of guessing.As Thorn put away the last of the roots, Akira came zipping back, dashing from tree to tree until she was above Thorn's head.\"Master, master! There are big smelly wolves ahead! There are bunches of them! They have a gross cave and everything!\"\"Whoa, calm down Akira. Where are they?\"\"Up ahead, I can show you. You should bash them so they leave and stop making the forest smelly! Come on, come on!\" Turning on her heel, the furry ailuridae dashed off again, almost disappearing from sight as she rushed ahead.\"Hey, slow down. How am I supposed to follow you like that?\" \"Master, you are too slow! What if they leave? Then you can't bash them!\"Shaking his head, Thorn followed behind his battle pet. After walking for a few minutes, Thorn saw Akira crouched on a branch, peering around a tree. Trying to move as quietly as possible, Thorn moved up to the trunk of the tree, peeking his head around it. Ahead of him, three large, corrupted wolves lounged in front of a small cave carved into the side of the hill.Akira scampered down the tree, climbing out on Thorn's broad shoulder to whisper into his ear, \"Master, there are six smelly wolves.\" \"I only see three.\"\"I smell six different, gross smells. I have the best nose, so you can trust me.\" Akira patted Thorn's head comfortingly with her tiny claws.\"Okay, let's sneak up on them,\" Thorn whispered back, pulling his arbalest out of his inventory and loading it as quietly as he could.\"Uh, master, that doesn't seem like it is going to work.\"\"Why not? If we sneak up on them, we might be able to take a couple of them down before they can react.\"\"But, master, you are too loud.\"\"Huh?\"\"You sound like an earth dragon when you walk, master. Even when you tiptoe.\" Akira looked at Thorn innocently. \"Or, if not an earth dragon, then maybe a whole herd of big deer. Really big deer. Or moose.\"\"Wait, so they know we are here?\" Thorn planted his face into his hand. \"Then why are we whispering?\"\"I'm not sure, master, but you were doing it, so I did it too.\"\"But why are those three not responding to us? Oh, wait. It is so the others can flank us, right?\" Turning his head, Thorn could make out three large, corrupted wolves stalking silently through the trees behind him. \"Hah. Akira, in the future, if someone or something is trying to sneak up on us, please let me know.\"\"Okay, master, I can do that.\"Judging the distance, Thorn knew he would not get more than one shot with his arbalest, so he readied his tetsubo in his other hand. He had been debating the effectiveness of the mace-like weapon versus fighting unarmed and had found it better when dealing with multiple enemies, but now was not the time to debate that.The corrupted wolves, seeing him turn around, paused, the largest of the group taking an aggressive step forward to stare at him. Lifting its head, it barked out a sharp command, sending its two companions farther out to the side to flank Thorn's position.\"Master, the smelly dogs by the cave got up. I think they are coming over.\" Akira had jumped back up in the tree and was watching the wolves by the cave.\"Okay, I got it. Stay up in the tree and don't get near the fight, okay?\"Now completely surrounded, Thorn's eyes narrowed. This was the worst possible situation. These corrupted wolves were bigger than the ones he had fought outside of Berum by almost fifty percent. The spikes growing from their shoulders were heavier, their claws longer, and a faint rotting stench drifted from their panting mouths.It was obvious from their attempted ambush that these corrupted wolves were smarter, as well. They had neatly encircled Thorn, putting him at a serious disadvantage. Quickly considering his options, Thorn knew that he needed to break out. His body tensed as he glanced to each side. The wolves flanking him were both smaller than the leader by almost a foot, so Thorn decided to go left. Just as he was about to launch himself forward, a thought drifted into his mind, causing him to fix his eyes on the largest wolf.If he went left or right, the three wolves closing in from the cave would be able to attack him from the side, while the enormous wolf leader would attack him from the other, keeping him in his current situation. And if the wolf he targeted backed up or delayed him, he would still be completely surrounded. If that was the case, it might be better to just crush the biggest corrupted wolf in the pack; maybe that would intimidate the others. Settling on this new plan in a split second, Thorn launched himself forward, dashing straight toward the corrupted wolf leader. As he moved, his massive crossbow swung to the side and, with a loud hiss, the bolt blurred through the air, burying itself in the chest of the corrupted wolf on the left.Thorn's massive frame barreled forward, moving significantly faster than one would expect from something his size. The corrupted wolf leader, startled by Thorn's charge, was not interested in backing down and, with a howl, charged out to meet him, its fetid maw opened wide. The sharp howls of the four remaining wolves rang out behind Thorn, mixed with Akira's sharp chittering, but he ignored all of it, focusing all of his attention on the muscular bundle of razor sharp teeth and claws in front of him. Just before they smashed into each other, the giant corrupted wolf launched itself into the air, swinging wildly with its claws.Thorn planted himself, his left foot driving into the ground as he got ready to swing, hitting the ground so hard that his foot actually sank into the dirt. Thorn swung his tetsubo with all the strength he could muster, smashing it into the leaping wolf's shoulder and side. With a yelp, the corrupted wolf abruptly changed direction, pinballing through the forest, smashing into trees as Thorn's blow sent it flying.Using the follow through of his swing, Thorn turned around just in time to see another corrupted wolf jumping at him. With a roar, Thorn dropped his tetsubo and caught the wolf around the throat with his right hand, smashing it into the ground. He hissed in pain as the flailing claws of the creature dragged gouges up his arm, mentally cursing himself for not having equipped his armor.With no time to spare for his bleeding wounds, he grabbed his tetsubo from the ground and smashed the wolf's head in with the butt end, stepping over the corpse to meet the three approaching wolves. Despite Thorn's show of force, the corrupted wolves showed nothing but madness in their eyes as they charged him. Fury, excitement, anticipation, and a whole host of other feelings began to build in Thorn's chest as he readied himself. There was something in this bloody, dangerous conflict that he loved.Knowing that he was not going to get out of this fight unscathed, Thorn threw caution to the wind and thundered forward, his weapon swinging.  A few tense moments later, he had successfully crushed another corrupted wolf but at the price of a wicked-looking cut along his ribs and back. The last two corrupted wolves had learned nothing from their dead companions and lunged forward, their jaws snapping. Jumping to the side to avoid them, Thorn smashed through them, his tetsubo whirling as Master Sun had taught him. Locked in the deadly dance, Thorn focused on defending against the two corrupted wolves. Just as he had learned, he spun and blocked, smashing out with attacks when he was able.The wolves snapped at him, dodging back as best as they could. Not letting up, Thorn pressed forward, breaking the neck of one corrupted wolf with a smashing blow. The last corrupted wolf stood no chance on its own and, while it managed to maul Thorn's arm with its last desperate attack, it died soon after.Breathing out heavily, Thorn stood on the blood-splattered, torn up ground, his heart rate slowly calming down. The fight had been intense, but he had made it through mostly unscathed. Nothing that wouldn't heal with a bit of rest, at least. The corrupted wolves had been unexpectedly difficult to fight. They were stronger and bigger than the corrupted wolves he had fought before, and smarter as well.If it had not been for his conversation with Akira, they may have succeeded in their attempt to ambush Thorn, which would have been even more dangerous. \"Master! Watch out!\" Snapped out of his thoughts, Thorn felt a sharp, piercing pain as the corrupted wolf leader sank its teeth into his back!", "Grimacing at the pain, Thorn had never been more thankful for the game-like elements of Nova Terra. As the large teeth of the corrupted wolf leader sank into his back, Thorn twisted around, throwing an elbow behind him to try and dislodge the beast. Holding on with its massive jaws, the corrupted wolf leader ripped at his back and legs with its four paws, cutting deeply into his skin!After two blows, he finally managed to get a hand around one of its legs and, summoning his strength, Thorn ripped it from his back, throwing it away. Blood gushing from his body, Thorn fell to one knee, trying to prop himself up as his strength flagged. He could feel his health draining from his body, and the familiar darkness began to creep into the edge of his vision.Struggling to its feet, its eyes radiating madness and corruption, the wolf growled menacingly. Its left shoulder was smashed almost beyond recognition, a dark, jagged bone visible through the gash Thorn's tetsubo had left in its matted black fur. Yet it forced itself to stand and limped toward Thorn again, blood dripping from its slavering jaws. A deep red aura surrounded the monster, reminding him of Amis' enraged form. No wonder the first blow had not killed it.\"Whew, these guys are tougher than I thought.\" Not used to having an enemy survive a hit, Thorn had been complacent, forgetting about the threat of the corrupted wolf leader after he knocked it aside. As the corrupted wolf circled, Thorn could not help but notice that its footsteps were completely silent, explaining how it had gotten so close.A quick glance showed Thorn that his health was at less than 50%, and it was dropping fast. Understandable, considering the amount of blood he was leaving on the ground. Still, he estimated that he had at least six seconds before his health bottomed out. But that meant he had to figure out a way to muster up the strength to stand. The corrupted wolf, despite its drive for blood, had an uncanny awareness of his weakness and was staying just out of range, pacing slowly back and forth.\"Master, master! Are you okay?\" Akira's worried voice rang in Thorn's head.\"Not really. My health is dropping fast, so get ready to be unsummoned,\" Thorn responded keeping his eyes locked on the corrupted wolf leader.\"I should use my abilities to help you fight, master! Royal Grace!\" Akira squeaked.Startled, Thorn saw a royal purple light wrap around him as Akira finished activating her skill. Miraculously, his health stopped going down and even began to slowly fill back up as his wounds instantly ceased bleeding, his skin knitting itself back together. \"Akira, you can heal?\" \"Of course I can, master. Didn't I tell you that I am the best?\" \"Then why didn't you heal me earlier?\"\"Um, I didn't think you needed it. Plus you told me to stay out of the fight, master,\" Akira pouted.\"Ah, that is true. Next time you have my permission to heal me.\" Thorn flexed his fingers as strength rushed back into them.The corrupted wolf leader saw Thorn's expression perk up and immediately noticed that he was healing under his battle pet's spell. Furious, it howled with rage, lunging forward. Thorn met it head on, one hand clamping down on its throat, the other slamming into the side of its head, crushing its skull with an audible crack. Seeing that it was still twitching, Thorn threw the corpse down and stomped on the back of its spine, making sure that even if it was still alive, it would not be getting up again.The sudden reversal of fortune was welcome, but the fight had exhausted Thorn mentally. Still, it was not quite time to rest. After looting the corrupted wolves' bodies, Thorn made his way to the cave where the wolves made their den. While the cave entrance was more than big enough for even the corrupted wolf leader to walk in and out, there was no way Thorn was going to fit, so instead he sat down to rest while he sent Akira into the cave to scout around.A few moments later, she bounced out of the cave, a handful of colorful flowers clutched in her paws and perched on Thorn's knee.\"Master, the smelly wolves had a lot of flowers! Look, there was this shiny one and this purple one. There was this yellow and green one and an ugly brown whiskery thing that I didn't bring because it was gross! There was also this glowing rock thing that was very warm. It is stuck in the wall, and I couldn't get it out.\"Carefully examining the flowers, Thorn's eyes lit up. The shiny flower that Akira had brought out looked like the flower that grew on Silverleaf. The others were not the plants that he was looking for, but he was not about to turn down more herbs. Still, since there was no way he would be able to go in and get the flowers himself, Thorn marked the cave's location on his map and decided to wait for Mina to arrive.Finding some large logs, he blocked the entrance of the cave and continued his search for the plants he needed for the potions. Thorn had been thinking a lot about potions and their potential uses for him. He had noticed that fights in Nova Terra were much like fights in real life. Dangerous, painful, and above all, brief. There did not seem to be many dragged out fights. Still, his race and larger size did give him a better chance of staying up while wounded, so maybe carrying some health potions would be a good idea. Plus, Thorn had found [The Complete Alchemist], so he was confident that he could develop his own potions, if given time to practice. By the time night had fallen, Thorn had picked up his last deer heart, a couple more Zimph roots, and three Wolfsbane. According to Akira, there were way more than 25 Silverleaf in the cave, so Thorn only needed to find a spot with Blue Bells. Deciding to ask around Greymane, Thorn made his way back to town and curled up on his bed at the inn. The next morning, Thorn ate a big breakfast and resumed his search. He had asked various townsfolk if they knew a good place to find Blue Bells, and after encouraging a couple of people with a few silver, they marked some spots on his map. According to Akira, the corrupted wolves that he had killed were the only ones in the valley, so Thorn was able to relax his guard as he walked around.The day passed quietly as Thorn slowly wandered around the forest, collecting the Blue Bells he needed. Thankful for his map, Thorn added as many details as he could while he walked. After all, if he was really going to be assuming the role of Lord Greymane, it made sense to know his territory. A bit after dinner time, Thorn was sitting quietly on a hill outside of town, watching as smoke rose from the various homes and buildings, when he got a call from Oberlin. Accepting it, he saw Oberlin's face pop up. Other than a few streaks of dirt, the Infinite Key Master looked as dapper as ever.\"Hey, Thorn.\" Oberlin's eyes lit up with excitement when he saw Thorn's broad face. \"You guessed right. Everything is going according to plan so far. I will need to stay down here for at least another week or two but, after that, I should be able to rejoin you.\"\"Awesome. Let me know if you have any trouble or need any backup.\"\"Thanks. So far, it has been pretty smooth, but I will let you know.\"After chatting for a few more minutes, Thorn ended the call and leaned back in the grass. Slowly, ever so slowly, a vision for his future was starting to come into focus. Much of the specific detail would depend on the outcome of his quest, but the general shape of his future was becoming clear. Mina and Velin met Thorn the next day at the edge of town, both looking as neat as a pin, despite their two day journey. The lack of fast travel in Nova Terra had been a point of confusion to Thorn until he remembered the 1:7 time dilation ratio the game employed. After all, that made three full days of travel in game a few hours of real time. Of course, that did not stop Mina from complaining about it.\"Why is your quest so far out in the boonies, Thorn? We had to walk forever! It took us so long! We need to get mounts. I can't believe this stupid game has not made mounts for everyone yet. It isn't fair that you can only get them in the South. We need mounts, too.\"\"Go buy a battle pet.\" It was obvious from Velin's tone that she felt no sympathy.\"But they are so expensive!\" Mina's eyes lit up. \"Oh, that's right! Thorn, you just got a battle pet, right? An ailuridae, I think? Can you show us?\"\"Sure, hold on a second. She should be somewhere around here.\" Calling Akira back from wherever she was exploring, Thorn explained how he had found her by accidently knocking over the tree that she called home. After a few moments, Akira jumped out of a tree, landing on Thorn's shoulder. Shy, she half hid behind his head while peeking out at the girls.\"Try giving her some food.\" Thorn pulled out a few of Akira's favorite pastries and handed them to Mina, who was practically drooling at the sight of the furry little creature. \"Master, who are these people?\"\"These are friends, make sure you treat them well, okay? No stealing stuff from them.\"\"Come on, little cute furry creature, come to Mina.\" Holding out one of the pastries that Thorn had handed her, Mina tried to entice Akira off of Thorn's shoulder.\"You are so awkward that I am embarrassed for you.\" Velin covered her eyes with her hand. \"Let me show you how to do this.\"Watching the two girls play around as they competed for Akira's attention, Thorn couldn't help but smile. He could tell that the last bits of awkwardness in their relationship were disappearing, and the girls were starting to feel more comfortable around him, which was a big relief. Mina was back to her chatty self and even Velin was starting to relax a bit.After she had successfully coaxed Akira down from her perch, Velin left her playing with Mina and turned to Thorn, her expression becoming serious.\"I know we talked about it briefly before, but we need to do some digging before we take up any quests here. Because of the way Nova Terra is built, each quest you do has the potential to lock off other paths that could have been taken.\"\"Every choice has a consequence, right?\"\"Exactly. And if there are quests related to ownership of the valley, than we need to prioritize them.\"\"Okay, say that you are right and there are quests related to controlling the valley. How do we go about finding them? So far, all the quests I've gotten have been a bit random.\"\"Not random, focused. Every quest in the game is unique. Two quests could have the same overall goal, but how you get it, and the specifics of it, will always be tailored to the player or group that gets it. Take this situation, for example. You have a quest for clearing the keep and recovering the statue of Hati for the temple in Greymane, but even if I go and talk to the village leader, I will not be able to get the same quest. I could get a quest for finding the statue, but the reward might not be the same, and I will not be able to get it the same way.\"Where this gets complicated, is that any quest chain of significant value will generate contested quest lines. That means that, if what I suspect is true, there are probably multiple quest lines that lead to this area, and their ultimate prize has something to do with taking over the valley. Big guilds are always on the lookout for these sorts of quests lines. This means that, if you have the quest, we can pretty much guarantee that there are other people here or on the way.\"\"So you are saying that we are on a time limit?\" Thorn scratched his head.\"Yes. We need to find the proper quest line before anyone else does, and complete it before anyone else can progress in their competing quest line. And, to do that, we need to find out the true history of this area. What we have now is just pieced together from a few stories. I think we should start with Greymane and see if we can find anyone who knows the history of the valley. Hopefully, that will lead us to the right quest.\"As Velin spoke, Thorn's mind was working furiously. While he had forgiven her and Mina and even hired them to his team, there was still some hesitancy in his heart about sharing information with them. But, if he was really serious about repairing their relationship, then hiding things from them was counterproductive. Taking a deep breath, Thorn strengthened his resolve and crushed the vestiges of resistance in his chest.\"Do you mean a quest like this?\" Thorn opened his status window and shared his [Lord Greymane, the Moon Wolf] title. Her jaw dropping open as she read the title's description, Velin stared at Thorn in undisguised astonishment. \"How...\" the War Priestess' eyes grew even wider as she read it again. \"Wait, Chosen of Hati? You are an avatar?\"Nodding, Thorn sat down. \"Yeah, after I was stripped of my potential, I ended up fighting off Karandaras, the Betrayer, cleansing Hati's altar, meeting Hati, the Moon Wolf, and becoming an avatar.\"\"That sounds intense. But how did you end up with the Lord Greymane title?\"\"Ah, earlier I killed a native named Gargish, the Blood Hunter. He dropped a ring that gave me the title.\" Thorn held up his right hand, showing the silver ring. \"I mentioned it the first time we saw the wolfkin in the cave. He was part of a quest line called 'The Blood Moon' or something. This is the continuation of that.\"\"So you came here to try and claim the title? That makes more sense.\" Velin pondered for a moment. \"You said you also got a quest for retrieving the statue of Hati to revive the temple, right? And the keep you have to take back from the werewolves is potentially related to Hati, as well. We need more information, but I would say that there is high potential that finishing these quest lines will result in controlling this valley.\"\"Which means we need to expect to face some of the major guilds, right?\"\"Correct. I know for certain that Ragnarok is looking for the valley. One of my friends in the guild dropped a hint when I talked to her yesterday. I'm not sure if there are any other guilds involved. This quest puts us quite a ways ahead, as does the fact that you cleaned out the library at Davyos' Fall. Regardless, we should plan for a fight.\"", "\"You know, Thorn, I don't know that I have ever encountered someone as lucky as you in this game.\" Velin tucked a strand hair behind her pointy ear as she looked at Thorn's seated figure. \"Haha, I told you.\" Mina stood up from where she had been playing with Akira. \"Big guy has the best luck ever. And if we hang out with him, maybe some of it will rub off on us.\"\"That is not how it works.\"\"Says who? You told me that the gods were all dead, too. But he met one. And now he is an avatar. I bet he has a rare race, too.\"\"Unique, actually. I'm a Titan.\"\"What!\" Mina and Velin both yelled, startling Akira, who jumped up onto Thorn's head and squeaked angrily at them.\"Yeah, the system could not handle my size with any of the existing races, so it gave me a unique race.\"\"I take it back. I have certainly never encountered anyone as lucky as you,\" Velin gave a sigh of defeat.\"This is so awesome! I bet Ouroboros will be so jealous when he finds out!\" Mina danced around in excitement. \"We should call him and rub it in his face.\"\"That is a terrible idea, Mina. Thorn, I don't know if I can handle any more surprises, so if there is anything else, keep it to yourself for now.\" Velin cracked a rare joke.Laughing, Thorn led the girls to the cave where he had fought against the corrupted wolves. He had explained how Akira had found the last few ingredients that they needed for the potions, but he was simply too large to fit inside the cave to retrieve them. While this earned him endless mocking from Mina, Thorn did not mind. Her teasing was meant in good fun and did not bother him at all.Velin had shown an interested expression when Thorn brought up the glowing stone that Akira found, but declined to comment when he asked about it, saying that it would be better to see the stone first. When they got to the cave, Akira affirmed that the logs had not been disturbed, so Thorn lifted them out of the way, and the girls scrambled into the cave after Velin summoned a light. Standing outside, Thorn looked around at the quiet forest while he waited, thinking about the fights that were coming. His encounter with Gargish, the Blood Hunter, had given him a healthy respect for werewolves, and it had only been reinforced by the fight with Amis. While he was much more confident in his fighting ability than he had been back then, his fight with the corrupted wolves at this very spot made him very aware that he could not take anything for granted.Gargish had been one of the few things Thorn had encountered so far that was able to move him, and, combined with the werewolf's blistering speed, he had made for a nasty foe. Just thinking about a whole castle full of enemies like that made Thorn shiver.Mina and Velin took half an hour to collect all the Sliverleaf in the cave, before crawling back out to join Thorn. They had picked close to forty plants, giving them more than enough for the potions. Velin had also spent some time looking at the glowing stone that Akira had spotted. Unsure of what it was or how it worked, she left it in place.The three players made good time on their way back to Greymane, arriving mid-afternoon. After delivering the last of the herbs to Charles, the girls explored the town, while Thorn hung out with the alchemist. Since he had the books for it, Thorn figured that picking up some alchemy would not hurt. In reality, however, turned out to be much more difficult than he had anticipated. Charles settled down on a tall stool at his alchemist lab in the back room of the inn. He explained that, more often than not, alchemist labs would be hidden in a basement, or somewhere underground, but that the inn only had a cellar, and it was too small to use. Wiping away imaginary sweat from his brow, Thorn could only be grateful that he did not have to squeeze into a tiny space to watch.The initial steps of the potions seemed reasonable. Charles crushed the Blue Bells and, carefully separating the plant pulp out, poured the remaining liquid into little containers. The pulp was piled together in a large press that he used to squeeze out the last few drops of liquid. After clearing the press and washing all of his tools, Charles repeated the process for the Silverleaf and Wolfsbane. The Zimph root and the deer hearts were diced into tiny pieces, placed into separate pots, and set to simmer over a low flame. While waiting for the cooking mixtures to finish, Charles began to carefully portion out the Blue Bells, Wolfsbane, and Silverleaf liquids with a dropper. He paid special attention to the Wolfsbane, making sure to only get four drops in each container.Watching Charles use the tiny dropper to mix the potions, Thorn immediately gave up the idea of becoming an alchemist. The closer he looked, the more tiny implements he saw. There were tiny spoons, knives, droppers, mixers, glass beakers, and countless other apparatus that he had no desire to try and fiddle with. That dropper was half the size of his pinky, for goodness sake. Handling fragile glass like that? Forget it. At first, Thorn was disappointed that he would not be able to become an alchemist, but the more he thought about it, the less of an issue it seemed to be. From the detail and care Charles was applying to his tasks, it was obvious that alchemy was a tricky, detailed occupation, so it made much more sense for Thorn to hand the books to someone who would be able to focus on alchemy completely.After watching for a few more minutes, Thorn excused himself and went to look for Mina and Velin. He found them sitting in the shade across from the inn, drinking lemonade and eating some cakes that Mina had brought with her. \"Hey, Thorn,\" Mina waved as Thorn's large figure appeared.\"Find anything interesting?\" After a sceptical look at the bench they were sitting on, Thorn settled for squatting next to them.\"Nah, this town is pretty desolate. Everyone is really down. Velin thinks it is the curse you mentioned.\"\"Correct.\" Velin meticulously licked some remnants of frosting from her fingers. \"There is a curse over the whole village. I haven't worked out the exact details, but apart from making everyone depressed, it seems to lower the effectiveness of most actions by at least 30%. This village will bloom, should we be successful in returning the statue.\"\"What do you think about our chances of succeeding?\" Thorn asked, swallowing the food he had gotten out.\"100%.\"\"That high?\" Thorn raised an eyebrow at Velin's flat statement.\"Thorn, have you paid any attention to yourself recently?\" Mina jumped in. \"You are a walking boss. You beat an entire squad of Crimson Snakes to death with almost no effort. As long as you have a healer and someone to watch your back, there is no question about succeeding.\"\"Mina is correct. Our party composition is ideal. Though you are still classless, you can operate as both a tank and as our main damage. Mina and I can support through crowd control and healing while handling any rogues or stealth.\"\"And me! And me!\" Akira, mad at being left out, jumped up and down on Thorn's shoulder.\"And we cannot forget Akira, who can support all of us with healing,\" Velin smoothly continued, not missing a beat as she broke off a piece of her pastry and held it out. Akira, quite pleased, scampered down from Thorn's shoulder and took the piece of pastry in triumph. \"Once we have the potions, we should be able to mount ambushes on the werewolves, which will help us clear Greymane Keep. We will want to be cautious. The werewolves are pretty tough enemies.\"\"We burned through them pretty fast last time. What's the big deal?\"\"Those were not werewolves; they were wolfkin.\" Thorn shook his head at Mina. \"The difference is pretty substantial. Remember Amis? Imagine an army of him. After he hulked out.\"\"Okay, that might be scary. Are all werewolves that big?\"\"Actually, the first werewolf I faced was bigger. So I would assume that the current boss of the keep will be the biggest so far. We'll have to move carefully, so the potions will certainly help.\"As the three players hung out, chatting about their upcoming adventure, Charles emerged from the inn, looking tired.\"Hey, Thorn. Those potions are done, but they need to sit overnight otherwise they will not be as potent. They should be ready to go tomorrow morning.\"\"Thanks for your hard work, Charles.\"\"It's my pleasure, if you can wipe out those monsters in the keep. A couple things to note: the scent erasure potion works for you and anything you have equipped when you take it. If you get other things after that, it will not block their scents, so be careful what you pick up. Also, the attraction potion is quite potent, so only use a bit at a time. Just splash it on a wall or something.\" The tired alchemist waved a hand and walked off, calling back over his shoulder, \"Oh, if you haven't talked to Thomas, you should. He knows more about the keep than anyone.\"\"Thomas is?\" Velin asked Thorn, watching Charles' back.\"Hm? Oh, Thomas is the village elder. Old guy, big beard, hangs out in the mayor's office? Or jail. I think it is both.\"\"We should definitely go talk to him.\" Velin perked up at the prospect of getting more information. Half an hour later, the group sat around a table in the town's makeshift mayor's office. Thomas, as grumpy as always, seemed secretly delighted to have an audience and began chatting as soon as they sat down.\"So, you want  to know the history of the keep, do you?\" Pausing to take a swig from the bottle of wine that Thorn had handed him, he coughed and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \"It's a pretty dark tale. Not sure if your ears will bear the telling of it. Still, if you are going to go into that den of evil, you should know what you are getting yourself into. Let me think now. It has been about twenty years since the curse of the blood moon appeared, but to get to the true heart of the story, we must go back much farther.\"In the Era of Gods, this land was prosperous. The forest kept to the mountains, and the valley was filled with farms. Humans lived together with many other races here in Greymane. The land was peaceful, protected by the Temple of the Moon, a fortress monastery in the mountains. The warrior monks protected the valley, and in return were provided with food and other resources. Every generation, one of their numbers would be chosen to come down to the valley to lead the people of the valley, being named Lord Greymane. The other monks became Night Walkers, worshipers of Hati, the god who rules the night. The Night Walkers ranged far from the Temple, destroying evil wherever it was found.\"Yet, in time, a corruption set in. The Night Walkers grew stronger and fiercer, becoming a powerful force that many other gods feared. They ranged farther afield, leaving the valley defenseless. One day, the army of another god came, overrunning the valley and destroying the Temple of the Moon. Furious, the Lord of that generation, a wolfkin named Davyos, led the few remaining wolfkin monks in a terrible ritual, producing the blood moon curse. Their act plunged the land into chaos, and the valley was devastated.\"When the Night Walkers returned and saw what had become of the valley, they blamed Davyos and cast him from the valley. The few remaining Night Walkers appointed a Lord Greymane from the village and chased after Davyos. Where he went, no one knows. Nothing was heard from the Night Walkers, or Davyos' descendants, until twenty years ago, when a powerful werewolf returned, bringing with him the curse.\"Slaughtering his way into Greymane Keep, which had been built on top of the ruins of the Temple of the Moon, the werewolf turned the resident Lord Greymane, Gargish Moonclaw, into a beast like himself. Since then, the werewolves have ruled the valley with the aid of their corrupted wolves, treating those of us in the valley as nothing more than vermin. The curse deforms anyone who remains in the castle past nightfall into a werewolf and binds them to the property, except on the full moon, when they come out and scour the land.\"If you are able, travelers, I beg you to save us from this cursed life.\" Putting the bottle of wine on the table, Thomas stood unsteadily and bowed his head to the three players. \"The valley desperately needs a true lord, and if you can destroy the evil that plagues our land, we will willingly serve.\"*ding* \"Well, the good news is that we know how many werewolves we have to kill,\" Thorn said with a sigh, sharing the quest with the two girls. \"The bad news is that there are a lot of them.\"\"Sheesh. 100? No, 101. That is only a little bit terrifying.\" Mina paled as she read the quest. \"It is alright. We'll just take it slow. Thomas, do you have any advice for us?\"\"Hmm? Advice? For attacking the castle?\" Thomas sat down and took a long swig of wine. \"Go during the day? The werewolves seem to be more active during the night time, so maybe attacking during the day would be the best.\"\"Thank you. We will accept this quest and will break the curse over the valley.\" Nodding to the headman, Thorn and the girls left the building.\"Thorn, is Oberlin going to be joining us?\" Velin asked without lifting her head from her notepad, where she was writing something down as she walked.\"I am not sure that he will make it back in time, so it will probably just be us. We should plan that way, at least. Lets go get some sleep. We have a crazy day tomorrow.\"", "The morning sun rose in the valley, driving back the deep mist that blanketed the forest. Thorn watched with fascination as the mist retreated around him, melting under the warm rays of the sun. He looked over his shoulder at Velin and Mina. The elven War Priestess looked as unperturbed as always, pouring over something in her notebook. Mina, on the other hand, was grumbling under her breath about everything that her eyes fell on.Amused, Thorn turned back to look at the stone spire peeking over the trees ahead. They had left the inn before the sun was up at Velin's insistence. Thorn had been planning to sleep in, but Velin had argued that an earlier start would ensure that they would be able to complete their quest before nightfall. Truthfully, sleeping in was more of a habit than anything else, as the time-dilation in Nova Terra made it easy for players to stay up for multiple days at a time, so neither Thorn nor Velin took Mina's grumbles seriously.\"Summon Akira.\"With a blue flash, Thorn's furry battle pet appeared, chattering excitedly and jumping to his shoulder.\"Master, master! Where are we going today?\"\"Hey, Akira.\" Scratching behind her ears, Thorn stroked Akira's head. \"We've got a big day ahead of us and a lot of work for you to do, okay? You'll need to be at the top of your game, alright?\"\"Hah, of course.\" Akira wiggled her three tails in excitement. \"I am the best ailuridae, so of course I'll be amazing.\"Smiling, Thorn turned back to look at Velin, who was still going over her notes. Rather than bothering her, Thorn pulled out the rest of his breakfast and began to eat it in earnest. He had found a virtual shop in Fantasia that sold breakfast burritos, so he bought three hundred of them. Kept warm and fresh by his inventory, he had been enjoying them for breakfast over the last couple days.Watching Thorn eat a full burrito in two bites, Mina could only stare, her appetite disappearing. There was something off-putting about watching food being thrown into the bottomless pit that Thorn called a stomach. \"Don't you ever stop eating?\" Ignoring Mina, Thorn continued eating his breakfast burritos, only stopping after he had finished his tenth. Velin had finished what she was doing and walked up to stand beside him, her tall, slim figure only coming up to the bottom of his chest. \"This might be pretty tricky, but I think we have a good shot at completing this quest in one day, if we can focus. It will depend on a few things. First, is this a dungeon or just a field quest? A field quest is any normal quest. We can stop and start a field quest as we want, because the environment is not locked like a dungeon. If, on the other hand, this quest is in a dungeon, we will have to try and power through it in one go.\"Second, how strong are the basic werewolves? If they are all as dangerous as that Gargish you told us about then, we are in a lot of trouble. However, I believe that Gargish, the Blood Hunter, was actually Gargish Moonclaw, the former Lord Greymane. That would explain why you got the ring and quest from him. It would also indicate that we have some hope, as it is unlikely that the regular werewolves will be as strong as he was.\"Still, we are going to have to pay careful attention to how many werewolves we pull at one time. This leads us to the third and fourth points, the two potions that we picked up from Charles this morning. The scent erasure potion will last for four hours, while the attraction potions can each be used five times. We have five of each potion, so we will have to ration them wisely.\"\"So each use of an attraction potion needs to attract four werewolves on average? Are we going to be able to deal with four werewolves?\" Thorn asked, scratching his head.\"Given your track record so far, I don't think it will be an issue.\" Velin smiled. \"The larger concern is the density of the distribution of werewolves and the layout of the castle.\"\"Are you two done yet?\" From the side, Mina frowned unhappily at Thorn and Velin. \"Why do you have to over-plan everything? Thorn, just smash them while Velin heals you. I'll slow them down or shoot them full of holes. What's so hard? I mean, this is a game, right?\"\"Fair.\" Thorn shrugged. \"Mina has a good point. We are probably better off just rolling with whatever situations crop up.\"\"Agreed. I would, however, recommend that we use the scent erasing potion before we get any closer to the keep.\" Velin put away her notebook and withdrew four blue potions, handing one each to Mina and Thorn, and uncorking another for Akira.Looking at the glowing blue liquid in the vial, Thorn had the strangest impression that his life was never going to be the same again. For so long, his reality had plodded along, mostly unchanging. And now he was standing in a mist covered forest, about to drink a blue, glowing, magic potion before assaulting a castle full of werewolves in order to reclaim a giant wolf god's statue. How life changed.Grinning, Thorn downed the potion in a single gulp.*ding* \"Well. That sucks,\" Thorn muttered, reading the second notification again.\"What's wrong?\"\"I have natural resistance,\" Thorn sighed, sharing the second notification with the curious witch.\"Are you serious? Is that your racial trait? Gross.\" Mina shook her head. \"Velin, he has resistance to magic potions. Actually, it looks like he has resistance to most physical effects.\"\"I have resistance to mental effects, as well.\" Thorn smiled smugly, sharing his [Titan's Strength] racial trait.\"Literally disgusting.\" Mina rolled her eyes at his boasting.\"If that potion is only going to last for an hour, we better get moving.\" Velin started toward the keep, carefully writing down the descriptions of Thorn's racial traits as she walked.Within minutes of setting out, they approached the road leading up to the keep. Built on the ruins of the Temple of the Moon, Greymane Keep was perched on the side of a mountain, a single dirt road rising steeply from the forest up to the mist-shrouded castle. The keep was a gloomy, gothic-looking place, overgrown with ivy and in complete disrepair. Despite the bright morning sun, the mist surrounding the keep seemed to be a permanent fixture, lending it a spooky air.Climbing the rough switchback road, Thorn and the others soon found themselves in the shadow of its southern wall. Looking at the crumbling stone and weed-ridden gate, Mina could not help but shiver.\"Master, are you sure you want this place? It smells funny,\" said Akira, jumping down from Thorn's shoulder and sniffing the fallen rubble.\"Eh, even if I don't keep it, clearing out the werewolves will be good for the village. And who knows, something good might come of it.\"\"If you say so.\"The keep lacked a proper moat, but there was a deep pit at the edge of the wall running underneath an old wooden drawbridge that looked like it would snap in a stiff breeze. Nervous, Thorn tested it carefully before putting his full weight onto it. Though it groaned in protest, the bridge held, so Thorn whispered a quick prayer and tried to walk as lightly as he could.The four carefully crossed the rotting wooden drawbridge as a few shafts of sunlight broke through the heavy clouds, bathing the castle in a warm, golden glow. Almost instantly, Akira's mood brightened, and she began to frolic through the tall grass and overgrown shrubbery. Thorn watched her with an amused look. He had never had a pet before, so this was a completely novel experience for him. An experience that he was quite enjoying.While the sun did much to dispel the gloom of the castle, it was evident that the gloom wouldn't give up without a fight. Seeping from the castle was a dark grey miasma that seemed to actively battle the sunlight, preventing it from reaching inside. Thorn walked up to the castle's gate and looked at it curiously. Despite the age of the castle, the gate seemed in relatively good shape, not showing the same rot that the drawbridge did. Pushing hard on one of the doors, Thorn managed to get it open wide enough for the girls before the door caught on a rock.\"Hold on, let me see what it is caught on.\" Mina pushed Thorn to the side and squeezed in through the opening in the doors.\"Alright, but be careful. Yell if there are any enemies.\" After a moment of silence, Mina called back through the entrance in a quiet voice, \"Umm, we may have some trouble.\"\"What is going on? Mina?\" Not getting a response to her question, Velin squeezed through the small opening in the doors. Waiting outside, Thorn had no way of seeing what was happening in the courtyard of the keep. \"Watch out!\"Hearing Velin's yell, Thorn instantly sprang into action. Gripping the partially opened door, he heaved, the muscles in his shoulders and arms rippling as he exerted all his strength.*CRACK*With a thunderous sound, the thick, wooden castle gate splintered, shattering into pieces as Thorn ripped it from its hinges. Taking a long step past the ruined gate into the courtyard, Thorn saw a group of werewolves bounding across the yard of the keep toward Mina, who was desperately warding off a werewolf in a tattered blue uniform. Near her, Velin struggled with another, similarly dressed werewolf.At the sight of the werewolves, a deep, burning anger ignited in Thorn's chest, sending his brain into overdrive. Roaring a challenge, the titan crouched slightly and launched himself into the air, flying toward the charging werewolves. Easily clearing the struggling girls, Thorn summoned his [Avatar of the Wolf] ability. As he flew through the air, silver light rippled around him, flowing like quicksilver around his hands and chest. Landing with a bang, the stone courtyard cracked and crumbled under his tremendous weight.Still carrying a jagged piece of the keep's gate, Thorn roared out another challenge and threw the piece of the gate at the approaching werewolves. Dodging nimbly, the three werewolves all got past it without getting hit, but it still slowed them. Taking advantage of the drop in momentum, Thorn charged into them, his large, clawed gauntlet taking a chunk of flesh from a werewolf who was still in the air, unable to dodge his swipe. Growling, the werewolves launched themselves at Thorn, entirely fearless, tangling him up in a furious melee.\"Akira, support Velin and Mina!\" Thorn shouted.Behind him, Velin was still struggling with the werewolf that had ambushed her, while Mina blinked this way and that, leading the last werewolf on a nerve-wracking chase. Squeaking furiously, Akira ran around on the edge of the fight, making sure to stay clear of the struggling players and out of the werewolves' reach. Velin, dodging skillfully out of the way of a fierce strike, lifted her staff, chanting in an arcane language. A bright glow burst from her staff, temporarily robbing her attacker of sight. When the light faded, it revealed the elven War Priestess clothed in thick platemail, made entirely from burning light.No longer dodging, Velin accepted a strike from the enraged werewolf as she focused on the magic gathering at the tip of her staff. Sensing the growing danger, the werewolf attacked as furiously as it could, smashing against the glowing armor that surrounded Velin. Unable to cut through in time, the werewolf felt a sharp, burning pain rip through its stomach and looked down in horror, only to see its legs melting away under the intense light radiating from the end of Velin's staff.Across the yard, Mina was haphazardly dodging and teleporting, just barely staying ahead of the razor sharp claws and snapping teeth of the werewolf that had ambushed her. Her teleporting ability had a two second cooldown, so after teleporting, she would summon a trail of ice and slide along it, occasionally flicking out ice spikes that would jab into her attacker, leaving thin, bloody trails across his skin.Knowing she could not keep it up, Mina gritted her teeth and looked around, her eyes lighting up as she spotted Akira, who was squeaking at the side. Slipping closer, Mina yelled, \"Heal me!\" As an Ice Witch, the majority of Mina's spells were quick to cast but weaker in power and would be used in bulk to overwhelm her enemies. Unfortunately, in order to cast most of her offensive spells, she needed to activate her [Aspect of Winter] ability, which was going to be painful since she did not have the initiative in this fight. If she wanted to get her footing back, she would have to bleed a bit. Gritting her teeth and hoping that Thorn's battle pet could understand her, Mina abandoned her defense and readied her wand, a string of arcane syllables falling from her lips.Howling in triumph, the attacking werewolf ripped into her, sending her flying as its claws left bloody gouges across her chest. Gloating, it was about to pounce on her when the temperature dropped dangerously low, causing its motions to freeze up.\"Sub Zero.\" Her voice as bitterly cold as her spell, Mina rose to her feet, feeling the warm magic from Akira's Royal Grace ability closing her wounds. Finally ready to fight, Mina gripped her wand and pointed at the stunned werewolf. It was her turn.At first, Thorn was worried that the werewolves would be too much for their group to handle, but he quickly realized that they were quite similar to the five corrupted wolves he had fought in the valley a few days ago.Large, hunched, and shaggy, the werewolves looked like overgrown, feral wolfkin. Knotted muscles covered in scars and mangy fur dominated their frame, broken only by their sharp claws and teeth. They were neither as quick or as strong as Thorn remembered Gargish, the Blood Hunter, had been and they were not particularly clever, either. Despite the fact that he was facing off against three of them, Thorn quickly fell into a solid rhythm when he realized that he did not have to be afraid of their hits. Their claws had trouble with his armor, while his cut through them like a hot knife through butter. Growling furiously, one of the werewolves lunged forward, its maw opening wide. Sharp teeth glistened in the morning sunlight as its foul breath washed over Thorn.", "Expecting to sink his teeth into warm, soft flesh, the werewolf was stunned when, instead, it got a mouth full of hard metal. Hard metal with claws on the end. Thorn caught the lunging werewolf by the open mouth, large fingers wrapping around its head, his meaty hand preventing its jaws from being able to shut. Shocked at not being able to close its mouth, the werewolf struggled briefly until Thorn clenched his hand, ending its life. The two other attacking werewolves could not help but pause. While they were mostly fearless, watching the giant in front of them deal effortlessly with their companion put a damper on their aggression. Cautiously, they circled, unsure how they could hurt him.Sneering, Thorn threw the carcass in his hand at one werewolf while drawing his tetsubo from his inventory and lunging at the other. His weapon hummed through the air, smashing into the side of his target, sending the unfortunate monster flying through the air until the crumbling stone wall stopped it abruptly. The last werewolf, dodging out of the way of its companion's corpse, tried to take the opportunity to attack, only to feel an unstoppable pressure crushing down on its head. Not bothering to check if the last werewolf he just slapped down was still alive, Thorn turned to see how the girls were doing in time to see Velin burning the legs off her opponent. Wincing, Thorn reinforced his conviction to never get on the War Priestess' wrong side. Across the yard, Mina had just taken control of her fight, stunning the attacking werewolf with her [Sub Zero] spell.Seeing that Mina's ice spikes were not dealing a lot of damage, Thorn started over, only to see Mina wave her wand. The number of ice spikes abruptly increased, pounding down on the werewolf in an unending storm. Soon, the little that remained of the monster was buried under a pile of ice.\"You ladies alright?\"\"Yes, thanks to your quick response.\" Velin looked around carefully before dispelling her magic armor. Obviously exhausted, she sat down abruptly.\"What happened?\"\"When I first came in, I saw some werewolves come out of the keep.\" Mina walked over, carrying Akira. \"The three you fought. They did not see me, so I was going to try and get closer, but I was ambushed. Thankfully, Velin saw the two 'guards' as they jumped me and was able to pull one of them away. I'm sorry, I almost ruined everything because I wasn't prepared.\"\"Don't worry about it.\" Thorn waved a hand, wiping his other gauntlet off on one of the dead werewolves. Cleaning up the bodies while the girls rested from the adrenaline-packed fight, Thorn did not bother trying to skin the werewolves. Three of the werewolves had been crushed, burned, or ripped apart, and the other two were pretty badly damaged as well. After ten minutes, Velin had recovered, and they made their way into the keep itself. As they were resting, Thorn had kept a close watch on the entrance to the keep, assuming that the loud sound he made smashing the courtyard gate open would have drawn other enemies, but no beasts appeared, leading Velin to mention that the keep might actually be a dungeon.Sure enough, as they walked into the keep's entrance, Thorn got a popup.*ding* Curious, Thorn pulled up the quest that Thomas had given him. Noting that the five werewolves that they had killed in the courtyard counted toward the quest, Thorn nodded in satisfaction. The burning desire to wipe out the werewolves grew hotter, and he could not help but crack his knuckles.\"Whoa, slow down, big guy.\" Mina tugged on his arm ineffectually as he walked through the staging room at the dungeon entrance. \"We need to come up with some sort of plan.\"\"Weren't you the one who just wanted to deal with problems as they came up?\"Mina ignored his teasing, turning to look at Velin.\"Mina is right. We need a plan. We have the potions that will attract the werewolves, and it would be a complete waste to not use them with these narrow hallways.\"Following her pointing finger, Thorn took in the dark stone hallway at the end of the room. Wide enough for him to pass through if he ducked, Thorn immediately understood Velin's intention. It would be a relatively simple matter for him to block off the tunnel and deal with any werewolves that tried to attack him. Backed up by Velin and Akira's healing and Mina's ice spells and curses, Thorn was confident in being able to wipe out a thousand werewolves, let alone the 95 they needed to kill for the quest.\"Sounds good. But we will need to make sure we don't let any werewolves get behind us. We'll have to clear slowly.\" Lighting a torch, Thorn led the way, trying to stay as quiet as possible.The flickering torch light reflecting off of the dark grey stone that made up the walls of the keep set the tone of the dungeon expedition perfectly. As stealthily as possible, they moved down the dark hallway, until Akira remarked dryly, \"Master, you realize that sneaking around while holding a torch is pretty pointless, right?\"Blushing slightly at his stupidity, Thorn quickly put the torch out, explaining Akira's comment to Velin and Mina, causing them to chuckle. He continued to lead through the hallway, stepping over rubble and around deteriorating furniture. Quite soon, they came to a large room dominated by rotting tables and benches. The center of the hall featured a large fire pit, a rusty spit and roasting rack hanging over it. Moth-eaten tapestries hung from the vaulted ceiling, and place settings lay scattered on the floor. Chairs were overturned, and the sickening smell of rotten meat permeated the air. Thorn could only imagine how grand it had looked at one time. However, what really drew Thorn's attention were the four werewolves who had been ripping apart a human body that lay on one of the tables across the room. For a moment, Thorn and the four simply stared at each other, then with piercing howls, they threw away their meal and rushed him.Anticipating their movement, Thorn took a large step forward and hooked one of the tables with his foot. With a flick, the table tumbled through the air toward the oncoming werewolves, forcing them to dodge and granting Thorn and the girls a few more seconds. They bounded across the room, jumping over tables and passed chairs, their glistening teeth and claws straight out of a horror film. Motioning the girls back, Thorn retreated until he stood in the hallway, just outside the threshold of the great room.Within less than a second, the first werewolf reached him and pounced, when suddenly everything seemed to slow down, just like it had when Gargish jumped him. Feeling all of his senses sharpen exponentially, Thorn blinked in confusion at the slow motion pounce coming closer and closer. It was as if everything within the range of his senses came into sharp relief, categorized neatly in his head.He knew the number of chairs in the room, could count the stones in the wall to his left and was absolutely sure where the leap was going to take the werewolf. It wasn't until he was halfway through counting the werewolf's teeth that he remembered that the monster was trying to disembowel him, and the tetsubo in his hand shot forward in a straight stab.Calculating the werewolf's trajectory, Thorn pushed himself back slightly and then stabbed up as fast as he could. Everything sped back up, and the werewolf ran into the end of the tetsubo with a dull thud and a screech of pain. Rolling with it, Thorn stepped forward and thrust his tetsubo into the center of the werewolf's heart a second time.Blood dripped to the floor as the struggling monster was thrown off to the side. Crouching slightly, Thorn got ready to take on the others. He barely had time to take a defensive stance before the next one reached him, throwing a rapid series of slashes. Pushing into his opponent, Thorn managed to block most of the damage with his arms and shoulders but earned himself some deep lacerations for his efforts. Seeing the werewolf trying to back up, Thorn helped it along by snapping a kick into its stomach, watching it as it blasted backward, crushing a table before it hit the stone wall.Watching proved to be a mistake, as the third and fourth werewolves hit him at the same time, one trying to bite into his shoulder as the other tried to gouge out his side with wicked looking claws. A cold blast raced past Thorn's side as Mina jumped into the fight, stunning one of the werewolves. Seeing that the werewolf at his side had been dealt with, Thorn instinctively reached out and grabbed the head of the other werewolf and ripped it off his shoulder before throwing the startled monster at the wall so hard its skull shattered. As for the last werewolf, it only had time to gape in stunned astonishment before a fist smashed its head back, snapping its vertebrae like twigs.Now bleeding profusely from his shoulder and side, Thorn could feel the familiar weakness creeping in. Thankfully, Velin was quick with a healing spell and, in no time, warm energy filled him again.\"We seriously need to work on our coordination.\" Velin's voice was flat as she healed Thorn. \"And you need to pay more attention. I noticed you looking away in the middle of the fight. While you have a lot of advantages, lethal strikes will still kill you outright.\"As Thorn continued to heal up, Velin explained that, due to the realism of Nova Terra, attacks did not deal a set amount of damage, instead health represented the state of the individual's body. As damage accumulated, so did fatigue, making it harder to act the more damage a person took. This didn't mean that death would automatically come when an avatar's health hit zero, instead, it would come when the avatar succumbed to its fatigue. This allowed characters to launch devastating sneak attacks by targeting critical areas. A critical strike would overwhelm the target with a powerful burst of pain and fatigue, killing the player and logging them out of Nova Terra. The encounter that Thorn had with the four werewolves took only a few seconds, but it showcased exactly how lethal Nova Terra was. Not only were all four werewolves dead, but Thorn could easily have died as well. A bite to the shoulder was not that dangerous, but if the same attack had landed on his neck or head, it would have sent him out of the game instantly. \"Healing is strong, but my casts are not instant. If you get hit with a critical strike, you won't last long enough for me to get a healing spell off. Since you are not a traditional tank, we need to set up some better patterns, as my normal ways of handling damage are not going to work with you.\"\"Sure, what do you suggest?\"\"Give me a moment.\" Velin pulled out her notebook and started flipping through it while Thorn and Mina looted the bodies of the werewolves. After a few minutes, the elven Priestess snapped the book shut. \"Here is the plan. Thorn, we are going to forgo the normal means of tanking. The hallways are too tight for you to swing your club around.\"\"Tetsubo.\"\"Sure. The hallways are too tight for you to swing your tetsubo, so we need to stay in open spaces like this one. Additionally, since you are able to kill the werewolves with a solid hit, why not turn offense into defense? We are going to revisit our ambush strategy, using this hall. Using the attraction potions that we were given, we will draw the werewolves back here, and then we will hit them. Preferably with a table or something like that.\"\"Oooh, like a tower defense game!\" Mina's eyes glowed with excitement. \"Sort of. We want to lure the werewolves into the center of the room and then ambush them. There are five entrances to the hall. We can ignore the one we came through, leaving four, which means we either need to block off one, or someone has to handle two different hallways.\"\"How about Akira?\" Thorn scratched his head as he looked around the room. \"She could run down a hallway to attract the werewolves' attention.\"\"Can she outrun a werewolf?\"\"I'm honestly not sure.\" Calling his battle pet over, Thorn stroked her fur as he questioned her. \"Akira, can you outrun a werewolf?\"\"Of course I can!\" The little furry creature preened proudly. \"I am the fastest Ailauride ever!\"\"Uh huh. Well, she says she can.\" Thorn shrugged his massive shoulders at Velin. \"We can give it a try.\"\"We should not need to do much running, as the potion should do most of the work for us.\" Taking four of the potions out of her inventory, Velin handed them out. \"Alright, the plan is simple. We will each walk halfway down a hallway and drop a bit of the potion. Try to get it on the wall. We'll then wait to see who shows up. If no werewolves show up we will move to the 75% mark and repeat the process.\"Remember to retreat as soon as you apply it. We don't want to get seperated. As soon as you have applied the potion, come back to that entrance.\" Velin pointed to the doorway from which they had entered the great room. \"We'll stay in that hall until we see the werewolves, and then charge out to ambush them.\"\"Sounds good.\" Thorn nodded his head, holding a potion in his big hands. On a table, Akira crouched with a potion of her own.\"Haha, they won't know what hit them,\" Mina said, looking back at the others in excitement while she walked toward her hallway. Not paying attention, her foot caught on a rock, and she tripped, stumbling forward. Barely managing to get her feet under her, she finally stabilized, freezing as the glass bottle slipped from her hand and landed on the floor, shattering into a million pieces.An astringent, bitter smell rose into the air as the potion splattered onto Mina. A large puddle spread out on the ground as she stared in horror at the mess she had made. Hearing the shatter, Thorn and Velin looked at each other for a moment and began to run.", "\"Get back to the hallway!\" Thorn yelled, his deep voice booming through the great room. As quickly as possible, the three players ran back toward the hallway they had emerged from, Akira bounding ahead. Thomas had warned them to only use a bit of the attraction potion at a time since it was so potent, so Thorn could only imagine what dropping a whole bottle would do.It was not long before he found out. Shortly after they made it to the entrance of the great hall, Thorn picked up the faint howls. From all around the castle, the chilling sound echoed. Within moments, Thorn could make out the grunts and growls of the werewolves as they began to pour into the large hall. Werewolves bounded into the room from three of the four other entrances, their noses twitching. Dressed in a ragged collection of armor and uniforms, it was obvious that these werewolves had, at one point, been guards of Greymane Keep. Now twisted into monsters, the werewolves rushed into the great hall, sniffing the air as they came.Grey, black, and brown fur mixed together as the werewolves were drawn like magnets to the place Mina had tripped. Almost uncontrollably, they crowded around, pushing to be the closest to the puddle on the ground. Fangs and claws flashed in the light as the werewolves jostled for position.Not wanting to let this chance go to waste, Thorn knelt down and drew his arbalest, placing a pile of massive bolts against the wall next to him. The werewolves were so tightly clumped together that Thorn only had to aim in their general direction to guarantee that he would hit one. With a deep breath, he got ready to fire.The City Defender series looked normal in Thorn's hands, but standing next to it, Mina was once again struck by how absurdly large the siege crossbow was. Intended for use on a castle wall to defend against enemy siege weapons, the bolts were almost as tall as she was, and the metal bow was almost five inches thick at the center. Normally, it would take at least three men to handle it while it was mounted on the wall yet, Thorn handled it like a normal crossbow. Due to Thorn's modifications, the winch system was removed, making it impossible to draw without strength as insane as Thorn's.About to pull the trigger, Thorn felt a hand on his shoulder and paused. Velin walked forward quietly, muttering a spell subvocally as her long, elegant fingers brushed over the tips of the bolts, infusing them with a golden glow. Once she had finished casting her spell, she nodded at Thorn and stepped behind him again, readying a healing spell.With another deep breath, Thorn pulled the trigger on the City Defender, the powerful thrumm of the string rumbling in the hallway. Without looking to see if he hit anything, Thorn grabbed his next bolt and slid it into place, pulling back the metal string of the arbalest at the same time. Almost as soon as the bolt was in place, he steadied the massive crossbow and pulled the trigger again, at the same time reaching for the third bolt.Across the great hall, pandemonium reigned. The werewolves had not missed the loud noise of the arbalest firing, but none of them had immediately spotted Thorn and the girls in the entrance to the hall. Instead, they looked around in confusion for a split second. Their confusion did not last long though, as they soon felt the massive crossbow bolt that Thorn had fired ripping its way through their crowd.The first werewolf the bolt hit simply exploded into pieces as the force of the bolt hit its back. The second werewolf was luckier and only lost an arm and a chunk of skin from its side as the bolt deflected. Spinning with brutal force, the bolt smashed into another group of werewolves, breaking bones and throwing them to the floor. Furious howls of pain mixed with the cries of surprise as all of the werewolves fixed their eyes on the bolt that had shattered against the floor after slamming through the crowd.*WHUUMMM*The sound of a second bolt shocked the crowd of werewolves out of their stunned state, and they instantly began to scatter. Yet how could they be faster than the arbalest bolt? Two more unlucky werewolves were hit and died instantly. Not pausing, Thorn drew and fired the City Defender like a machine. So long as he aimed at a werewolf and pulled the trigger, the poor monster would vanish in a puff of red as the bolt passed through its location. Scrambling to get out of the way, the werewolves soon discovered Thorn's figure kneeling in the entrance to the great hall, and with furious howls, they began to charge.\"Mina!\" Velin shouted, pointing to a clump of werewolves charging over from the right side of the hall. \"[Avalanche],\" the witch commanded, summoning a massive swirl of snow and ice in the path of the charging werewolves. \"Thorn!\"Releasing one last bolt, Thorn put the arbalest in his inventory and drew his tetsubo, launching himself forward into the large hall. Like a freight train, he plowed over the werewolves who were leading the charge, his sheer weight smashing them to the side. Already, he could feel the warmth of Velin's healing spells landing on his back.Grinning ferociously, Thorn began to lay about with his tetsubo. With a whir, the large metal-studded club cut through the air so fast that it almost disappeared. Even grazing a werewolf proved enough to draw blood, and those that were unfortunate enough to be in the weapon's direct path simply ceased to exist. Cutting his way through the werewolves in front of the hall, Thorn checked quickly to make sure that the girls were alright before charging left with a roar. His glance had showed that the werewolves that Mina had tied up were struggling to get past her crowd control spells, giving him time to finish off the enemies on the other side.Mina was casting icy spell after icy spell, slowing the charging werewolves to a crawl. Next to her, the elven War Priestess cast healing spells in succession, making sure that Thorn's health was staying topped up. This freed Thorn to attack with abandon, trading hits with the werewolves. The muted pain settings made even the most vicious cut feel like a sting, so Thorn's intimate experience with suffering allowed him to ignore the attacks entirely.Within minutes, he had cleared two thirds of the room and turned to support, Mina who was beginning to struggle to keep the werewolves back. Thorn helped by picking up one of the long tables and lobbing it through the air at them, forcing them to dodge backwards. Charging forward, he smashed the last few werewolves apart and then walked back to where Mina and Velin were standing in the doorway. Akira, hanging on Mina's back, jumped up to Thorn's broad shoulder.\"Master! I helped the pointy hat lady!\"\"Thanks, Akira.\" Thorn scratched his battle pet behind the ears as he talked to Mina and Velin. \"How did it go on your end?\"\"Great! Akira was a big help. Her heal is a full restore, which allows me to cast without worrying about mana drain.\" Mina looked at Thorn's furry pet enviously. \"Are you sure you don't want to sell her?\"\"No way.\" Thorn shook his head as he fed Akira a treat. \"Velin, you were totally right. I'm much better at offense than I am at defense. It was helpful to not have to worry about defending while fighting.\"\"Yes, that went much better. We'll keep this pattern for now. The only thing we will need to worry about is if we get surrounded, but as long as we don't let enemies get behind us, we should be fine.\"After resting for a moment, Thorn and Mina sifted through the drops while Velin meditated. With Akira using her healing ability on Mina, and Velin keeping Thorn topped up, they did not have to do much resting between fights. Velin, on the other hand, was using mana like water and needed almost ten minutes before she was ready to go again.After picking up the drops, Thorn checked the hallways one by one, starting with the three hallways from which the werewolves had come. All three hallways led to empty rooms, abandoned in haste as the werewolves had picked up the smell of the potion. The last entrance had a thick, wooden door, so Thorn carefully eased the door open, revealing a hallway filled with cobwebs. From the undisturbed dust coating the floor, it was obvious that the hall hadn't been used in a long time, but soon the group came to a room with another werewolf in it. The monster raised its head as Thorn opened the door. Seeing each other at the same time, it started to turn toward him. Without hesitation, Thorn stepped up and, feet squared, jabbed out with his left hand as fast as he could, completely flattening the werewolf's snout and crushing its jaw. He followed up with wrapping his right hand around its neck, choking the rising howl of pain and then smashed his left fist into its head again, silencing the monster for good.It quickly evaporated into light, dropping a few coins, and Thorn examined his left gauntlet, which had been dented very slightly from the werewolf's teeth. Jabs worked quite well due to his absurd strength, but he didn't like the idea of harming his gear whenever he attacked an opponent. Shrugging, since there was nothing he could currently do, Thorn and the girls continued on their way. Apart from a close call when they walked around the corner into a three-werewolf patrol, Thorn didn't have too much trouble swiftly killing the werewolves they encountered. Mina would obstruct them, and Thorn would wade forward and stomp them into the ground, all the while healed by Velin. There were no more large fights on the first floor, and they had soon finished exploring it. Standing in front of the stairs to the second floor, Velin stopped the group. \"Before we go up to the second floor, we need to prepare. It has been three hours since we took our potions, which means Thorn's has run out, and ours have less than a quarter left. This means we need to prepare for waves of enemies, since they will be able to sniff us out. We can set up a trap, but we will have to be very careful that we don't attract the boss. Based on the size of the keep, it is unlikely that the dungeon is more than two floors, so we will probably be facing the boss on the next level, as well as all of the other werewolves.\"\"Do we need to change up our approach?\" Thorn asked, when Velin paused.\"No, I think we can maintain our current system, we just need to be ready to retreat if things start to go bad. These werewolves are not too dangerous because their defenses are weak. But if they do get hits in on me or Mina, we'll be in trouble.\"\"And this is why most people still run in the trinity formation,\" Mina chimed in.\"Trinity formation?\"\"Tank, heals, damage.\" Mina rolled her eyes at Thorn's question. \"There can be more than three in the group, but the roles are pretty locked when it comes to combat. On the other hand, we've got damage out the window, but not having someone to control aggro is a major weakness. A tank's role is less about taking damage, and more about controlling where enemies attack.\"\"That is true. Ouroboros was really good at that.\" Thorn nodded. More and more he was feeling the effect of not having a class. Even though he had abilities granted through his Avatar title, he was missing a lot of the basic abilities that came with even the standard classes.Resolving to make getting a class his priority, Thorn sat down with the girls and took a quick break. Getting out a few sandwiches that he had purchased in town and a large jug of iced tea, they ate and chatted. Thorn had gotten better at asking questions about the game, and Mina was always happy to chatter on about anything, so Thorn was able to put their breaks to good use.After conversing for ten minutes, they were fully rested. Getting up, Thorn brushed some crumbs off his pants and called Akira, who had been fighting with Mina over a couple of cookies. Seeing that everyone was ready, he led the way up the stairs to the second floor of the dungeon. As they walked up the curling staircase, Thorn checked the status of his quest. Thirty-three werewolves and a greater werewolf left, thought Thorn. Easily enough to provide a fatal challenge for the three of them should they not proceed carefully. Climbing up the dark stone staircase, Thorn could not help but marvel at the texture of the stone as he ran his armored fingers across the wall. Watching his fingers bounce along the slight inconsistencies, Thorn still found it hard to believe that all of this was just a game. More and more, he was beginning to treat this world as real.The more he learned about Nova Terra, the less it seemed like a game, or a way to pass his time. Intellectually, he knew that his body was stuck in a giant tube, being treated by an advanced form of nanobots while his mind wandered around in this fantasy world. Yet everyday, he woke up and ate, talked and fought, growing more at home in this virtual space. He could feel his mind adapting to the new rules of his body, and a small part of him was wondering if he would be able to adapt to life in his real body ever again.Hearing the tink, tink, tink of his gauntlets on the stone blocks, Thorn felt a poke and suddenly realized that Velin was glaring at him. Sheepishly, he took his hand back and walked as quietly as he could up the stairs. The top of the stairs led directly into a massive room, and it didn't take the party long to realize that something was off.", "The large room was divided into three rough sections, each marked out by iron pillars, as thick as Thorn's wrist, sunk into the stone floor. Attached to each pillar were three sets of heavy-duty chains suspending skeletons in various states of decay. Along the walls of the room dangled the corpses of prisoners and various instruments of torture. Directly in the center of the room a thick, rusty iron spike stood a full six feet tall with a skeleton impaled upon it.Stepping into the room, Thorn focused his gaze across the floor at a hulking brute of a monster, squatting on two back legs while it gnawed its way through chainmail armor to get at the flesh of the corpse it was feasting on. When Thorn and the girls came into the room, the monstrosity looked up at them and then slowly stood, rising to a full eight feet of pure muscle and horror. Metallic-looking fur covered its body, and its razor sharp claws were easily as long as Mina's forearm. Saliva dripping from its maw, the greater werewolf grinned, its bloody muzzle creating a terrifying picture. \"Looks like we have a guest,\" slurred the creature, tossing the remains of the adventurer it had been chewing on to the side. Without warning, it threw back its head and howled, a long echoing sound ringing around the keep. In response, howls erupted from every corner of the second floor, and the hurried sound of werewolves rushing toward them became quite clear. Within seconds, the room began to fill with werewolves, surrounding the group on three sides. As they pushed in, jostling for position, a large metal gate fell from the ceiling, cutting off the path back down the stairs and pushing them toward the center of the room. Their backs to a wall and with no escape, Thorn took a big breath. Mina and Velin had started chanting as soon as the greater werewolf howled, and as the door behind them came down, Thorn sprang into action, decisively rushing forward, determined to keep the werewolves from gaining any momentum. Surprised by Thorn's move, the greater werewolf roared out in anger, \"Kill him!\"Jumping into the group, Thorn began to lash out with his tetsubo as fast as he could, each blow containing all the force he could muster. If he couldn't disable a large percentage of the werewolves in this first rush, he knew that they would be in a lot of trouble. As the werewolves reacted and started to pile on, it became increasingly difficult for him to swing, as he had no room. Monsters flew through the air, skulls smashed and limbs bent, but as soon as Thorn managed to move one away, two would press into its place, their sharp claws reaching toward him. Thorn grimaced in pain as a claw caught his back, ripping through his leather armor and gouging his skin. Thankfully, Velin's warm healing light landed on him at the same time. Squirming slightly at the strange feeling of being injured and healed at the same time, Thorn spun quickly. He threw out a sharp hook, blasting the werewolf that struck him into another, its mangled snout spraying blood and saliva through the air.A snap kick drove another werewolf back, directly into an iron post but at the cost of another gash on Thorn's shoulder. The monsters were simply too numerous for him to avoid, especially if he wanted to attack, and as the brawl continued, more and more cuts appeared on his flesh.Back near the door, Mina was sending out a storm of snow and ice, trying her best to bog down the werewolves at the edges of the fight while using barrages of ice spikes to drive back the werewolves that approached her and Velin. Seeing a werewolf jumping for Thorn's neck, she pointed.\"[Sub Zero]!\" The pouncing werewolf froze solid and Thorn, feeling the cold air behind him, turned and backhanded it across the room, where it shattered against the wall. As the struggle continued, Thorn swung his tetsubo with abandon, smashing down everything that came into its range. Finally, unable to bare the strain of the chaotic fight, his weapon snapped off at the handle. Tossing away the broken handle, Thorn began to lash out with punches and kicks as fast as he could. It was a deadly whirlwind of bone-crushing kicks and punches, razor sharp claws and snapping jaws. Countless werewolves fell, but no matter how many Thorn crushed into the ground, more jumped forward to strike at him. Additionally, the longer he fought, the faster he seemed to lose his energy, despite Velin's healing. Sparing a glance down, he could see blood soaking his armor, new wounds opening up even as others closed under the warm light. With the sight of the blood came the sure knowledge that, unless the fight ended soon, he would be experiencing his second death in Nova Terra. \"Thorn, I can't keep up!\" Velin shouted, desperately trying to heal Thorn through all the damage. The bloody streaks appeared on Thorn's massive form faster than her light could heal him, causing his health to fall steadily. Every strike from the werewolves stacked a bleeding condition onto Thorn, and Velin's condition clearing spell was on cooldown. While Thorn was struggling in the middle of the brawl, Akira was hiding behind Mina, trying to stay out of sight of the werewolves. As a support battle pet, she was no match for the monsters in a direct fight and thought it much safer to keep a distance. As she watched Thorn smash through the werewolves, worry began to grow. She watched as, slowly but surely, Thorn became sluggish and began to take more hits as his fatigue built up.Wanting to help, Akira rushed out and darted up an unsuspecting werewolf's back, launching herself through the air while calling up her most powerful support spell, [Majesty]. A spell unique to Royal Ailuridae, [Majesty] imbued a target with a majestic glow, drawing those around them in and providing various buffs to their stats. However, most important was the fact that, when cast, it removed all negative status effects on the target while restoring them to perfect health. In this case, it cleared Thorn's bleeding condition and put his health back to full.Akira was so focused on casting her spell that she failed to notice the large black claw coming toward her side until it cut through her fur. With a shriek, she fell to the ground, barely rolling out of the way as another strike came down at her head.Thorn felt his fatigue suddenly vanish when Akira jumped, but it wasn't until he heard her shriek that he understood what had happened. Seeing her disappear under the roiling sea of monsters, his stomach jumped straight into his throat and a frenzy filled him. [Wolf's Rage] triggered on its own, filling Thorn with a savage power. Throwing his head back, Thorn instinctively activated [Wolf Lord's Howl], the shockwave of sound stunning all of the werewolves. Still howling, he sprang into the dense pile of monsters, blasting them away with a swift flurry of punches and kicks. Failing to move them fast enough, he saw Akira surface again, bleeding from where she had been struck, desperate to get away from the werewolves, only to be struck again by a heavy claw, her battered body flying back toward the wall. Just as she was about to hit the wall, a bright light fell on her, its warm glow healing her wounds and waking her from her stunned state. Scrambling, Akira quickly hid behind Mina, who furiously blasted the werewolf that had been chasing the ailuridae into a popsicle. Squeaking furiously, Akira shivered, frightened by her close brush with death.Never more thankful for teammates, seeing Akira nearly get cut down pierced Thorn's heart, poking a hole in the thick wall that he used to shield his emotions from others. Like a dam bursting, those feelings spewed forth, unleashing a wrath he had not known he possessed. A feral growl escaped his clenched teeth, and a bloody glow shone in his eyes. Grabbing a werewolf by the throat, he began to swing it like a club, smashing into the other werewolves without any regard for defense. Large gashes began to reappear in his skin as the monsters slashed and snapped at him, but Thorn paid them no mind, simply grinding any werewolves who got close into paste.His eyes saw only the outlines of his enemies within a red mist, and his hands sought them out without rest, gouging, crushing, striking and maiming. No matter how many werewolves came forward, Thorn pressed on mindlessly, slaughtering them however he could.Within minutes, a sombre silence descended on the room, broken only by Thorn's hoarse breathing and the rasping breath of the greater werewolf, who was staring at him in bemused astonishment. When Thorn had entered the room, the greater werewolf had summoned the remainder of its kin from around the castle to deal with him, only to be surprised by the ferocity with which Thorn slaughtered them. Behind Thorn, Mina stared in shock, her mouth open. Catching sight of Thorn's bloodshot eyes as he looked around for more enemies to shred, the Ice Witch could not suppress a shudder. Thorn had just gone through almost thirty werewolves like a meat grinder, and the raw savagery of it caused her to shake.Velin stood behind Mina, her brow furrowed. Despite the worry that was evident on her face, she did not forget to heal Thorn, doing her best to bring him back up to full health. Sensing that Mina was about to call out, Velin grabbed her, placing a hand over the shorter girl's mouth.\"Shh. Don't draw his attention. Something is wrong.\" Velin whispered, her eyes fixed on Thorn's broad back.The greater werewolf wasn't concerned with the deaths of its kin; they would reappear as long as the curse continued. Rather, the greater werewolf was just surprised that Thorn had managed to make it through all 33 of the werewolves it had called and still remain standing. Bleeding from a dozen serious gashes, it was a miracle that Thorn hadn't collapsed long ago.Thorn, for his part, still wasn't thinking properly. Having given into his anger, all of the sorrow, loneliness, fear, and worry that he had stored up in his heart throughout his life began to burn, serving as fuel for his rage. The 16 years of suppressed emotion was pouring out, feeding the flames of his anger until it was an all-consuming blaze.Leaning heavily on the iron spike in the center of the room, the only things keeping him from sprinting forward were his iron self-control and his fearsome grip on top of the metal spike. Looking around at the corpses surrounding him, Thorn could feel the murderous drive to rip into the greater werewolf trying to control him. His gaze eventually settled on the greater werewolf, who was beginning to slowly make his way toward him from the throne. As the boss monster broke into a charge, one of the few remaining parts of Thorn's mind that possessed restraint recognized the danger and let go, sending him hurtling to meet the greater werewolf.Issuing a roar of superhuman force, Thorn met the boss' charge. With an ear-shattering boom, they collided, sending dust and blood flying. Smashing a fist into the greater werewolf's chest, Thorn felt a razor sharp claw pierce his chest in return, and only a desperate twist of his body prevented it from cutting into his heart. Still, the fury gripping him did not let him back down as he threw blow after blow at the greater werewolf, forcing it back.Snarling, the greater werewolf slipped to the side, striking again. Its razor sharp claws cut into him. Fiery pain erupted in his chest as blood spurted out, soaking the front of his body in gore. Darkness began to creep into his vision, and Thorn could feel his strength draining quickly in spite of Velin's attempts to heal him. Yet, in the haze of his fading consciousness, a stubborn ember glowed, refusing to be extinguished.Scenes from his childhood flashed across his eyes as the world grew dark. At three, already tall enough to look out over the window sill at the kids playing outside, unable to leave the house due to his condition. Age six, blowing out the candles on his birthday cake, only his aunt and nurse there to celebrate. The stark white walls of the hospital where the doctors finally put a name and description to his condition the day after his ninth birthday. The lonely hours that stretched into days, weeks, and months when his aunt was away on business.All his life he had been alone, isolated and protected from the world and anything that could harm him, protected from himself most of all. And now that he had the chance to experience true freedom, the monster in front of him was trying to take it all away. Intellectually, Thorn knew that giving in to his unbelievable fatigue would simply send him back to the spawn room, a simple rebirth of his avatar. Yet, for whatever reason, Thorn could not tolerate the thought of it. The ember of resistance that burned in his soul ignited, and his slipping hands tightened on the massive spike he was leaning on. Peering through the haze at the wavering figure of the leering werewolf, who had just stabbed him, Thorn grimaced in pain, and his hand closed over the massive claw that impaled him, holding it fast as if letting go meant the end of everything. The ember burst into flame, a flame that raged through him, forcing a low rumble out of his chest as he straightened up from his slumped position.The greater werewolf simply couldn't believe his eyes as before him the gore-slicked figure held on with a desperation that was out of this world. The fearsome grip crushed the bones in the werewolf's wrist, yet no matter how it struggled, it could not break free. It watched in growing horror as the monster who had walked into its lair began to straighten up. Looking into Thorn's eyes, it saw nothing but the mad promise of death, and its instincts kicked in, forcing it into a mad scramble backward. The greater werewolf was used to firmly occupying the highest spot on the food chain, but right now it felt like nothing more than a rabbit being hunted. Or rather, the greater werewolf would have scrambled backward if his claw was not caught firmly by Thorn's hand.Thorn, barely aware of his actions, continued to hold onto the struggling werewolf, his right arm straining at the firmly planted metal spike in the center of the stone floor. Heaving upwards with a herculean effort, the veins on his arm bulging, Thorn's strength overcame the spike, and he ripped it from the floor. Thorn hoisted it like a giant club, bringing it down on the now whimpering werewolf with tremendous force that crushed its skull like an egg, blood and brain matter coating the impromptu weapon.*Ding* ", "Still caught in the grip of rage, Thorn's eyes fixed on the throne where the greater werewolf had lounged when they first arrived. Carrying the corpse of the greater werewolf in one hand and dragging the six foot long metal spike in the other, Thorn stalked to the throne. A warm golden light surrounded Thorn as he advanced, stabilizing his injuries and restoring his strength. Sitting down on the throne, Thorn gave off a barbaric air.His ruined and bloody armor and the massive rusty spike resting against his leg presented a frightening picture, reinforced by the body of the greater werewolf dangling loosely from his other hand, its legs splayed across the steps leading up to the throne. Across the room, Velin kept Mina back, continuing to heal Thorn as she watched the blood in his eyes fade.After a few minutes of frozen silence, Thorn woke from his rage, the day's last light peeking through the window and bathing the room in a soft glow. As he blinked, the room changed, its dungeon-like air vanishing, replaced by decoration one would expect in an ancient castle.Old but regal tapestries adorned the walls, faded and moth-eaten. A red carpet ran down the center of the room from the large double doors, leaning precariously on their hinges, all the way up to the platform where he sat in a large wooden throne. Around the outside of the keep, the thick, gloomy mist that had blocked out the sun slowly faded away. A ripple seemed to pass through the valley, lifting the silent, oppressive air that had once smothered the forest.His mind still bleary, Thorn ran his hands over the chair, marveling at the detailed workmanship that had created the lifelike wolves that formed the armrests. The corpse of the greater werewolf had disappeared from his hand and turned into a large black wolfskin carpet, its scarred head staring at the door from under the wolf throne. After blinking a few times, a notification caught Thorn's attention, and he clicked it open, resulting in a torrent of messages blocking his vision.By the door, Mina slowly calmed down the frantic Akira, stroking the ailuridae's fur as she observed the changes in the dungeon.\"Boy, am I glad we're his friends,\" she mumbled. \"He just soloed a boss with no effort.\"\"On that, we agree. Apologizing to him was certainly the best idea you have ever had.\" A small smile grew on Velin's lips as she watched Thorn, who was frowning on his new throne. \"Come on, we should go greet the new Lord Greymane.\"As they approached, Velin watched Thorn carefully. She had seen a frightening rage in his eyes as he ripped the greater werewolf apart and was slightly worried that rage still consumed him. Seeing that his eyes were clear, she gave a small sigh of relief and bowed her head slightly as Mina spoke.\"I can't believe you killed that monster by yourself!\"\"Only thanks to your help.\" Thorn smiled, standing from the wolf throne and walking down the steps. \"Velin, if it wasn't for you and Akira healing me, I don't think I would have survived.\"\"Happy to help. Did you complete the quest?\"\"Yeah, though we still have to go back to the temple in the village to unlock it as a respawn point.\"\"It looks like you unlocked your title, though.\"\"Yup. I'm officially the new Lord Greymane.\" Thorn swiped through the notifications that had popped up after the fight.     Sorting through all the various alerts took a while, and by the time he reached the end, Thorn had a better idea of what was going on. By killing the greater werewolf and sitting on the Wolf Throne, he had completed both of his objectives. Not only had he lifted the curse for the quest that Elder Thomas had given him, but he had also unlocked his [Lord Greymane] title, and now he was officially the Wolf Lord, ruler of Greymane Castle and the surrounding lands.Mina and Velin had gone to explore the rest of the second floor of the keep while Thorn looked through the [RMS]. Opening it up, he began to scan its options. The basic menu was divided into four sections, each representing an aspect of governance. In the bottom right, there was a timer showing there were fourteen days before players would be able to select Greymane as their starting location.The [RMS - Economy] tab controlled things like taxes, trade goods, guild rules, and various agricultural sliders that determined what seeds the native farmers had access to. After that came the [RMS - Citizen] tab that controlled various decisions related to the population of his land as well as containing statistics on the levels of happiness, wealth, health and other factors that his subjects currently enjoyed.The other two tabs were the self-explanatory [RMS - Military] and [RMS - Diplomacy] tabs. All in all, the [RMS] was complex and as highly detailed as Thorn expected. The only things that took Thorn by surprise were the fact that the Diplomacy tab also contained a plethora of options for running an intelligence agency and that the Military tab already had a number of soldier natives listed as waiting to be claimed.Curious, Thorn selected the name of a captain and pressed the button to claim his soldier. A moment passed, and then, with a slight popping sound and a bright flash of light, a large wolfkin stepped out of the air.Easily standing 7' 6\", the muscular but lean wolfkin looked quite dashing in his brown and grey leathers, a massive longbow slung across his back and a sword at his side. Black fur from the top of his ears to the end of his tail, except for a section around his neck where the fur was tipped with silver, created a striking contrast with his green eyes. His status appeared about the same time he did, and Thorn noticed that the native count in the [RMS] rose by one. \"My Lord,\" said Del'har, falling to a knee, his right hand over his heart and his head bowed in a typical warrior salute. \"I am here to serve.\"\"Oh, eh...rise?\" Thorn coughed embarrassedly at the unexpected action.\"Thank you, my Lord. Have you decided how I may best serve you?\"\"Uh, no. How would I go about doing that?\"\"Simply select the citizen tab in the [RMS] and select what role I should be assigned next to my name, my Lord.\"\"Oh, got it, thanks. What sorts of skills do you have?\" Thorn asked as he fiddled with the [RMS] interface.\"My Lord, I am trained as a ranger, with a focus on using a bow and tracking. I am also trained as a leader, and before my fall, I was the leader of the Greymane's First Company.\"Thorn mused for a bit, considering various options before finally deciding that Del'har would take up his old position. Just like that, Greymane Keep gained its first captain. Going back to the military tab, Thorn found that the other soldiers listed were now grayed out. Seeing a symbol in the top right corner of the screen with a zero next to it, Thorn realized that he was out of the resource he had used to purchase Del'har. Putting that aside for the moment, Thorn looked through the other tabs. As he did so, a couple of things really stuck out to him. First, the economy of the area was in shambles. Currently, the castle required 300 gold a month to upkeep, but since it hadn't been paid in years, there was an absolutely massive amount of work that needed to be done to restore the castle. On top of that, the surrounding area brought in a bit less than 400 gold a month in taxes, but taxes hadn't been collected in years, either, which resulted in a completely empty treasury.Second, Thorn currently only had one subordinate, Captain Del'har, and the whole region only had 65 people listed as citizens. The castle alone needed a minimum of 75 people to operate normally, and while the surrounding lands could easily support thousands more, at least 50 people were required for Greymane Village to operate.The first problem was easy enough as Thorn had incredibly deep pockets and could simply finance his new land indefinitely without any issue. The second problem was trickier. The lack of population meant that he couldn't just throw money around and hope to succeed. While it looked like he could buy the currency he needed to hire native soldiers, he really needed builders, hunters, farmers and other skilled craftsmen, which were much harder to come by. Facing a massive shortage of people, there did not seem to be an immediate way to improve the situation. The girls returned from looking around the keep. As they approached Thorn, they were stopped by the tall wolfkin captain, who rested his hand on the pommel of his sword as he watched them warily. Seeing the protective gesture, Thorn smiled and waved him aside.\"Captain, these are my companions Mina and Velin. You don't need to stop them. Mina, Velin, this is Del'har, the captain of the First Company.\"His eyes still alert, Captain Del'har greeted the girls with a warrior's salute and stepped to the side, staying at the bottom of the steps leading up to the throne. \"Well, aren't you moving up in the world,\" Mina teased, laughing. \"You have your own minions and everything.\"\"Came with this ruined castle and tons of debt. The whole region is an absolute wreck. I'm honestly not sure if this title is a good or bad thing.\"\"Definitely a good thing,\" Velin assured him, handing him a silver statue. \"We found that in the lord's chambers. It looks like the statue you need to return to unlock the spawn point. So far, things have turned out as we planned. What are you worrying about?\"\"The valley is in shambles, and we only have two weeks until players start to show up.\"\"Sure, but if we can weather this first rough patch, controlling the region will bring a lot of money,\" Mina chimed in.\"Eh,\" Thorn responded with a shrug, uninterested by the earning potential of the region. \"It looks like the first issue we have to deal with is the lack of people. Rebuilding the castle, expanding Greymane Village, and harvesting the resources of the region are going to take a large population. Given what we know about how valuable controlling a region is, we will soon have people coming to see if they can wrestle this area away from us, and we need people of our own if we want to stop them. But, to support people, we need infrastructure, which we need people to build. See the problem?\"\"I do, but it is nothing that can't be dealt with.\" Velin nodded. \"It seems like the biggest issue facing us is time. Do you know how long we have until the region unlocks?\"\"Let me check.\" Pulling up the notification, Thorn looked at the timer that was counting down. [13:23:56:43]\"Thirteen days and twenty three something hours. So fourteen in-game days. Two days in the real world.\"\"That is not much time.\" Her brow furrowing, Velin thought for a moment. \"Normally, situations like this are handled by guilds because of the need for manpower and financial resources. Honestly, the easiest route is to sell this information to a guild and let them deal with it.\"\"Would they let me keep my position as Lord Greymane?\"\"Probably not.\" The elven War Priestess shook her head. \"Not unless you joined them. And even then, they may not.\"\"Then that isn't going to happen.\" Thorn smiled, his glinting teeth reminding Mina of a wolf.\"My Lord, I might have some ideas regarding this situation,\" the wolfkin captain said, dropping to a knee.\"Please stop doing that,\" replied Thorn. \"If you have to, just salute or something.\"\"Of course, my lord.\" The tall Wolfkin stood and crossed his right fist over his heart in a warrior's greeting. \"During my youth, the castle's upkeep was the responsibility of the residents of Greymane Village. As Lord Greymane, you can assign them to work on the keep.\"\"True, but honestly, they will have their hands full with rebuilding the village, so we cannot count on them for much.\" Thorn rubbed his chin. \"There is a lot to do everywhere and not nearly enough hands to do it.\"\"Well, uh.\" Captain Del'har paused for a moment and looked like he was lost in thought. After a serious internal struggle, the tall wolfkin looked at Thorn and spoke in a subdued tone, \"My lord, we should take a trip to the lands beyond the valley.\"\"You mean the mountains?\"\"Yes, my Lord. There is a group of my people who used to live here but were forced to move after the curse twisted the former lord. Now that the curse has been lifted it might be possible for us to bring them back, if you'll accompany me to go talk to them.\"\"Are they soldiers?\" Mina asked, remembering the group that they had encountered in the tunnel leading to Davyos' Fall.\"No, they are the descendants of the monks who used to live in the Temple of the Moon. They were once warrior monks, but, due to the strength of the werewolves, they fled to the mountains where they have lived ever since. If you could bring them back to the valley, you would gain a strong workforce.\"\"Are they still monks?\" Thorn asked, curious. \"Are there still Night Walkers among them?\"\"Yes, my Lord, though there have not been many Night Walkers for the past few generations, ever since the last Temple was moved from the valley. These monks are a mix of the descendants of the Moon Guardians, who were tasked with protecting the valley, and the remnants of the Night Walkers. Over time, as the memory of Hati, the Moon Wolf, faded, so too did their power. By the time the werewolf arrived and corrupted Gargish, the monastery was nothing but a shell of what it had once been, and the few remaining Moon Guardians had no choice but to join them and flee.\"\"What makes you think they will join us?\" Velin cut in.\"The Wolfkin are a proud race, and we serve the Greymane.\" The captain bristled at Velin's question. \"My Lord, as the one who freed the valley from the werewolf's curse and claimed the wolf throne, you are the only one the wolfkin will follow.\"\"Excellent.\" Thorn nodded. \"Let's go tomorrow. I am going to head to Greymane Village. I'll be back once I've had a chance to talk to Elder Thomas.\" \"Should we come with you?\" Mina asked. \"No, you and Velin can stay here. I'll move faster by myself.\" Thorn shook his head at Mina's question. \"Captain, please help these three ladies take inventory of what in this dump is still usable.\"", "After thinking it over, Thorn had decided to go see Thomas in Greymane Village to turn in the quest and activate the temple as a respawn point. That way, should anything happen, he would not be respawning days away in Berum.Leaving Captain Del'har and the girls to guard the castle, Thorn ran back through the woods. By himself, he covered distance at a fantastic rate, cutting the trip that had taken two hours that morning down to only twenty minutes. The village was quite different from when they had first arrived, and the loud sounds of a party could be heard spilling from the ramshackle tavern that stood near the center of town.As soon as he ducked into the bar, Thorn was hit full force by the scent of alcohol and roasted meat, and his stomach let out an involuntary grumble. The village leader,  Elder Thomas, and Captain Charles noticed him at the same time and smiled happily. Yet, suddenly, their expressions froze and, with a horrified look at each other, they quickly ran over, both bowing low and seeming quite nervous.\"My Lord!\" The elder's face was pale and white. \"We were just celebrating your magnificent ascension to the throne. We were going to visit you first thing tomorrow to bring tribute.\"\"Oh, that is great, uh. Actually, I just had a couple questions, so I thought I'd come over.\" Thorn looked around, totally oblivious to the terrified stares of everyone in the tavern. \"Um, I'm kinda hungry, could I maybe get a plate of something?\" he continued, absentmindedly scratching at his face.\"Yes, of course, my Lord! Quick, bring out something for his lordship to eat!\" Thomas, trembling slightly, led Thorn to a nearby table, shooing the occupants away. Scrambling to their feet and bowing repeatedly they seemed almost eager to get away from Thorn, who was finally starting to notice the deep silence in the tavern.\"Why is everyone so quiet?\" Thorn whispered to Charles.\"Um... My Lord, have you seen yourself recently?\" asked the alchemist gently. \"You look something awful. No offense, your Lordship.\"Frowning, Thorn looked down at himself for the first time and noticed that his outfit was in utter shambles. The armor he had gotten in Berum was twisted and bent beyond recognition, and his body was absolutely covered in dried blood, both his and his enemies. No wonder everyone was staring at him in fright; he looked like the main monster out of a horror flick. Disgustingly, flakes of dried blood would fall off of him every time he moved.Blushing until his face was the same deep red as the rest of him, Thorn asked for a bath to be drawn up, and despite his hunger he spent the next 45 minutes scrubbing the evidence of his battle away. The warm water was soon filthy with blood and grime, and Thorn had to replace the bathwater twice before he felt clean. As he scrubbed himself, he thought carefully about all that had happened since he first logged in. In a way, everything that had happened to Thorn in the past few months was utterly unbelievable, and he still hadn't fully wrapped his mind around it. But a couple things he had certainly realized: first, he had no way to log out apart from going to Fantasia, which, at this point, he wasn't really interested in, and second, he was currently the new Lord Greymane. Regardless of how he felt about it, he was stuck here in Angoril for the next fourteen years, and the local population all now knew him as the ruler of Greymane Keep and the surrounding region. A part of his mind worried that the role he had inherited would restrict his freedom, but at the same time, there was an excitement in knowing he could be at the center of something grand.Assuming, that is, that he could hold the castle. In the little bit of research that he had done, Thorn had read that towns, cities, castles, and even whole countries could be held by players if they had the strength and capital. The major issue was that Thorn, while he had plenty of capital, was only a single player. Compared to a guild his power was quite insufficient, even with Mina and Velin.Relaxing, Thorn's mind turned to Oberlin. He had sent the thief south after a long conversation, and from Oberlin's last message, it sounded like the trip was going to pay off. Hopefully, he would make it back within the next week. If it took much longer, Thorn might be in real trouble.Soon after, a refreshed and somewhat bashful Thorn made his way back down the groaning stairs and into the tavern's main room where the villagers were engaged in subdued conversation. As he re-entered, the villagers got their first good look at their new lord, and all were quite impressed with what they saw. While huge, Thorn was well muscled but not bulky, handsome but by no means a lady killer. A gentle air emanated from him, and his eyes were deep pools of blue, a testament to having seen and survived great suffering.Overall Thorn gave the impression of a stately mountain, solid and unyielding, certainly an improvement over the last Lord Greymane. Elder Thomas walked over to Thorn grinning.\"Feeling better, m'lord?\" he asked, chuckling at Thorn's blush.\"Yes, I am. Sorry about that, had a lot on my mind,\" replied Thorn, scratching his head bashfully. \"So, how about that food?\"\"Of course, of course. Please be seated!\"And so the night passed. The villagers soon realized that Thorn wasn't at all stuck up and got back to celebrating their new lord with copious amounts of alcohol, and it wasn't until the morning dawned that the tavern finally emptied. As the man of the hour, Thorn had been inundated with free drinks, all of which he readily consumed. Despite his young age in real life, he had consumed alcohol before and, while he was indifferent to the taste, it was practically impossible for him to get even the slightest of buzzes due to his abnormally large body.The early morning light of Nova Terra's sun saw Thorn supporting a staggering Charles while carrying a completely blitzed Elder Thomas over his shoulder as he walked them home. The evening had been pretty intense, and everyone in the town was going to get some rest. Like the rest of the town, the two men were soon in bed, sleeping off the effects of their wild celebrating. Thorn, on the other hand, walked around greeting the few people who were up and getting a better feel for the town. As he made his rounds, he stopped at the rundown temple and placed the silver wolf statue in its proper place.*ding* Greymane Village was situated on a hill and, at one time, had been encircled by a large stone wall about a quarter of the way from the top. That wall had long fallen into ruin as the village had been sacked again and again. Instead, it was now surrounded by a fragile-looking palisade that ran around the very top of the hill. The town itself had been reduced to a handful of stone buildings and wooden shacks with a barely functioning guard that was often away from the town hunting for food. Merchants had long since abandoned the road that cut through the forest, despite how long it took to go around, because of the danger the last lord had represented, and Greymane Village suffered as a result. The good news was that the forge was still in relatively good shape despite being rarely used over the last few years, and the town had just gained a rebirth point in its small temple.One of the notifications Thorn had received said that Greymane Village was unlocked as a starting location once the shrine had been restored and, opening up a browser, he looked for information on that process. After a couple minutes of hunting, Thorn learned that the town would go through a countdown before opening up as a new start location option. During this time, new natives would move into the area and set up, waiting for the incoming players.A bit more exploring led Thorn to figure out that it was going to be really important for the town to be a strong, defensible location, as beginner towns were hugely important. Each beginner town had a spawn point, allowing players to bind the town as the spot they would be resurrected if they died. If a guild or organization could hold on to a spawn point, they would possess a massive advantage in the area, as they could set the rules for using the rebirth shrine. In fact, that is why Thorn had to pay to use the respawn point in Embersplit. That money had gone into the coffers of the guild that controlled the city, and they in turn paid for the guards and other city improvements.Opening up his inventory, Thorn took a look at what sort of money he had available. Currently, his purse was woefully small, holding only a few gold. However, money was the last of his worries, as Julia had set up an account in Fantasia with a few million universal credits which, when converted, came out to 15 million gold. Surely enough to rebuild the town and castle. The real issue was in finding enough people to help him hold the area. It would be maddening to sink tons of money into improvements only to have the town and castle snapped up from underneath him. Mulling over all of this, Thorn left a message for Elder Thomas and Charles to come see him at the keep and ran back with some breakfast.The girls had logged out for a couple hours, so Thorn and Captain Del'har ate the breakfast Thorn had brought and then spent the morning demolishing the rotting parts of the castle while they waited for Thomas and Charles to arrive. Inside the crumbling wall of Greymane Keep were four other buildings besides the stone keep itself. A few hours later, just as Thorn was ripping the last of the rotten roof off the castle smithy, the village leader and the alchemist made their way into the yard, looking around in astonishment at how different everything was. All of the buildings except for the keep had been reduced to their bare states or simply ripped down entirely if they were rotten. Del'har had watched in awe as Thorn leveled entire buildings in minutes with little more than his bare hands.Seeing the two of them come in, Thorn quickly finished snapping the wooden slats. Throwing them into the fire they'd built in the center of the courtyard, he made his way over to the others. Instantly the two men dropped to their knees, but Thorn stopped them and told them to cut it out. Already uncomfortable towering over others, he instinctively disliked when they saluted on one knee.\"Enough of that. If you have to do something, just salute. Anyway, come on inside. We have a lot to talk about.\" Waving them inside the keep, he introduced the tall wolfkin as they walked in. \"This is Captain Del'har, he is the Captain of the First Company and my second in command. Okay, grab a seat because this might take a while.\"Getting comfortable in his throne, Thorn waved for the three natives to pull up some of the chairs he had moved into the throne room and then began to outline the issue as he saw it. \"First, let me lay out the problems. Problem number one, this castle and the surrounding areas are a complete and utter wreck. We have no economy, no infrastructure, barely any people and no money in the treasury. Given the number of people who will be coming, the whole area is likely to be in utter chaos soon.\"\"Uh, my lord? Who is coming?\" asked Charles, confusion written on his face.\"Yeah, that's right, I forgot to mention that Greymane Village will be unlocked as a spawn point for travelers within two week, and we have gained a respawn shrine there. This means that soon you will have travelers and merchants coming through bringing new wealth, but also bringing new trouble. As it is, the town is woefully unprepared and unprotected.\"\"A spawn p..point?\" stammered Elder Thomas. \"Yes. I'm sure you know what that means? This whole area is about to be busted wide open for exploration, trade, and settlement. On top of that, we will undoubtedly see an increase in banditry and other criminal activity if we can't keep a tight hold on everything from the get go. This brings us to problem number two. Our second major problem is that, once this area is announced as a new start location, we will probably have guilds coming in to try to take the town and castle for themselves in a bid to control all the land. This means that, apart from the normal issues we would face in developing this land, we are probably in for a war almost immediately.\"Here Thorn paused to look over the others. Elder Thomas' face was pale, Charles' face was grim and Captain Del'har's face was unreadable, though that could have been the fur. \"This means that we need to do three things: repair the city and castle, find people to settle, and find an army. And all of this needs to be done before our two weeks are up. The captain has mentioned he might know where to find some other wolfkin who can help with the castle, any other ideas?\"For a moment they all sat in silence, thinking about the coming changes and all the ramifications of those changes. Finally, Elder Thomas spoke up. \"My lord, we have tried to get new settlers to move out here in the past, but the werewolves and bandits kept them away. You have solved the problem of the werewolves, so more people might be willing to come, if you could deal with the bandits. as well.\"\"Talk to me about the bandits. Who are they and how many?\"\"Quite a tragic story, m'lord.\" The captain spoke up, taking over for Elder Thomas. \"They're mostly hunters and farmers and the odd soldier who, at one time, lived in these lands under the rule of the former lord. However, when the curse came, they were slowly forced off their lands or forced to run from imprisonment, for one reason or another. As a result, they have quite the enmity with Greymane castle and live as bandits, preying on anyone who travels the area. It's why we see so few merchants these days.\"\"Hmmm, I'll have to go have a talk with them. Any idea where they might be based?\" asked Thorn, scratching his chin as he thought.\"No, m'lord, they stay pretty well out of sight. They're all woodsmen and can't be found when they don't want to be.\"\"Okay, deal with bandits, check. What else do we have?\"\"We could advertise in a couple nearby cities for settlers if we had some coin to pay them.\" Elder Thomas looked thoughtful. \"Actually, we might be able to pick up some older mercenaries as well that way. You know, give them a place to take their families and half retire?\"\"Excellent idea, how fast can you do that?\" \"Eh, should be able to get a message to the three closest cities within a day or so.\" Elder Thomas stroked his beard before remembering who he was talking to and added a hasty \"my lord\" to the end of his statement.\"I told you not to worry about that sort of thing. I'm not one for ceremony. I'll be busy for a few days dealing with the bandits and going with the captain to see about those wolfkin. We have six days until it becomes known that a spawn point is opening up, probably another three days before the first travelers get here. Doesn't give us much time, so let's get to work. Elder, can you spend money for the town?\" asked Thorn, rising from his chair.\"Yes, my lord, I can. Thing is, we don't have any money to speak of.\"\"Not an issue,\" stated Thorn flatly, pulling out a massive pouch and setting it on the table, which creaked alarmingly. \"10,000 gold in there, use it to rebuild the village, focusing on defenses and infrastructure. By the time I get back, I want to be amazed. Now, please excuse me. I have much to do.\"Ignoring the utter shock on the Elder and Captain's faces, Thorn left the throne room through a door in the back, motioning Captain Del'har to follow. The room they entered seemed to have, at one time, been a library or office, but the few books that remained were practically unreadable. Thorn sat down carefully in one of the chairs but sprang back up when it began to crumble under him. Swearing at the previous landlord, he sat on a windowsill instead.\"Think we can trust them?\" Thorn asked over his shoulder as he watched the two townsmen leave the castle from the window.\"You did just give them a large amount of money, my lord,\" replied the captain flatly. \"You probably should have asked that question first.\"\"Yes, I guess I did.\" Thorn sighed. \"Well, we'll worry about that when we get back. Let's go meet those friends of yours.\"", "\"The village is just over those ridges, my Lord.\"Taking a moment to look around the mountain range they had been winding through for the last three hours, Thorn couldn't help but take a deep breath. The clear air filling his lungs invigorated him. The captain had led the way into the mountains behind the keep, and after three hours of hiking, they finally approached the village of the Wolfkin. \"Before we get there, why don't you tell me what I'll need to do to get them to come back with me?\" Thorn asked Captain Del'har bluntly, rather than beating around the bush. Unfortunately, the Wolfkin Captain shook his head.\"Sorry, my lord. I'm not quite sure. I have not met with them for a long time, so I don't know who is currently in charge. In the past, possessing the title of Greymane would have been enough. There is a possibility that is still the case, but I would not expect it to be that easy.\"\"Hmm. That is okay.\" Thorn smiled confidently, comforting the captain. \"I'm sure I'll be able to handle whatever they throw at me.\"Thorn and the captain continued their hike, climbing the mountainside at a swift rate. The girls had decided to stay back at the keep after hearing that the Wolfkin village was up in the mountains. Velin used the excuse of organizing the library while Mina just flat out refused to go. Not expecting to be gone for more than a day, Thorn had asked them to come up with a plan for the valley's development. While he had a rough idea of what he wanted to do with the valley, he was not confident in his ability to handle the specifics of how to get there.Velin, on the other hand, was both meticulous and a critical thinker. Even more importantly, she was experienced in coming up with plans, allowing Thorn the freedom to concern himself with the bigger picture while she handled the details. Mina, however, seemed just to spend her time running around. Constantly curious, Mina got bored quickly, causing her to bounce from one thing to the next. She was a good fit for Thorn's battle pet, Akira, and Thorn tasked the two of them with creating a detailed map of the whole valley, a task Mina accepted with relish. At first, Thorn was slightly worried as he watched them run off into the woods, but the detailed reports that soon started to arrive reassured him. Despite her scattered personality, Mina was an elite player, after all.The mountains that surrounded Fang Valley were thickly forested with imposing, snow-covered peaks. The mountain range seemed to stretch into forever, carrying on until the peaks faded into the horizon. A large mountain stood between Thorn and the Wolfkin village, towering over the keep at the far end of the valley. After examining the [RMS], Thorn was surprised to find that the whole mountain range was part of the Greymane domain and fell under Thorn's control. Nestled between two high peaks was a hidden village of thatched huts that sat at the edge of a large stone ruin. From a ridge overlooking the village Thorn could see clearly into its center, where a stone altar stood in the middle of a large dirt common area. The huts looked to be in ragged shape, lending an air of poverty to the village. Wolfkin walked to and fro in the village, going about their business. All of them were dressed in the same grey pants and shirts with different color sashes, reminding Thorn of oriental monks. As he and the captain approached the village, two guards saw them and gave a piercing call before rushing forward to bar their way. Despite the shabbiness of the buildings, there was nothing shabby about the two spears the guards held in their hands. The afternoon sunlight glinted off the sharp steel spearheads, and the black metal bodies of the spears trembled slightly with suppressed tension as the guards blocked the way into the village.\"Who are you?\" barked one of the Wolfkin. \"How did you find this village?\"\"Impudent!\" shouted Captain Del'har, his lips drawing back to show his sharp teeth.\"Calm down,\" Thorn commanded in a deep voice, resting a large hand on the captain's shoulder. \"Let me talk to them.\" Taking a small step in front of the captain, Thorn looked down at the two guards. \"We are here to see the village chief, or whoever is in charge. You can tell them that Lord Greymane has come.\"\"Lord Greymane?\" Startled, the two guards looked at each other, slightly lowering their spears. For a moment they hesitated, conversing in low voices. Arriving at an agreement, one ran back to the village, where curious Wolfkin were gathering, while the other guard completely lowered his spear, saying, \"I'm sorry, but you'll need to wait here.\"Feeling the captain bristling at the disrespect the guards were showing him, Thorn smiled and kept his hand on the tall Wolfkin's shoulder. Wolfkin were fiercely loyal and treated their hierarchy very strictly, so the sight of the guards questioning his lord made Captain Del'har seethe. Thorn could understand the guard's response, however, so after signaling the captain to bear with it, he took out a large rock he had found in the forest while hunting for potion supplies and sat down. As they waited, a crowd started to gather behind the remaining guard.Within a few minutes, the other guard could be seen walking back toward Thorn and the captain, an elderly Wolfkin walking slowly by his side. As they left the village, the gathered crowd separated, showing great respect for the elderly Wolfkin. His fur was a deep silver, and he bent over as he walked slowly to where Thorn sat. Before he arrived, Thorn stood to his feet, storing his large stone seat in his inventory.For a brief moment, the old Wolfkin and Thorn looked at each other, each taking the other's measure. Despite his eyes being blurred with age, Thorn could feel a faint pressure emanating from the elder Wolfkin, causing the hair on the back of his neck to rise. Stifling the urge to summon his Wolf Form, Thorn gave the elderly Wolfkin a warrior's salute. \"Greetings, I am Thorn, Lord Greymane, the Moon Wolf.\" Normally reluctant to reveal the full extent of his title, the instinctive threat he felt made Thorn feel competitive.\"Welcome, Thorn.\" The elderly Wolfkin ignored the stir in the crowd behind him caused by Thorn stating his title. \"I am Elder Havva. To what do we owe the pleasure of your visit?\"\"This is Captain Del'har, leader of my guard.\" Ignoring the question, Thorn introduced the captain, who was standing a step behind him. He looked at the crowd behind Elder Havva with interest. The crowd was mixed in age, though Thorn had a bit of trouble telling the differences between Wolfkin due to their features. After a moment of looking around, he looked at the elder, who was still waiting patiently in front of him. \"Aren't you going to invite me in?\"\"We don't welcome travelers here.\" The old Wolfkin shook his head.Unable to contain himself, Captain Del'har snarled, his hand going to the sword at this side. In response, the crowd bristled as well, growls mixing with the ringing of steel as they pulled out knives, short swords, and hatchets. \"Stand down.\" Thorn's deep voice was calm, seeming unbothered by the tension. \"I come with good intentions, there is no need for this conflict.\"\"The elder has already said that you are not welcome here.\" A large Wolfkin stalked forward from the crowd. Muscles bulged under his brown fur, and his piercing green eyes stared menacingly at Thorn. \"You should leave while you still can.\"Ignoring him, Thorn kept his eyes on Elder Havva.Infuriated at being ignored, the large Wolfkin drew his sword, crouching slightly as if he was about to charge. Sensing his increased tension, Thorn finally looked over, locking stares. The big Wolfkin looked dangerous, but for some reason, Thorn felt that Elder Havva was a larger threat.Just as the Wolfkin who stepped out was about to charge forward, Thorn held up his hand, the Ring of the Wolf Lord glinting in the sunlight. The large Wolfkin froze, his instincts stopping him from attacking. Slightly panicked, he looked at Elder Havva. The silver-furred Wolfkin closed his eyes with a sigh, his shoulders drooping slightly.\"You better come in to talk.\" Not waiting for a response, Elder Havva turned and shuffled back into the village. Thorn and Captain Del'har trailed behind him under the wary gaze of the guards. Leading the way to a hut near the stone altar, the elder waved for Thorn to follow inside before entering himself. Squeezing in proved difficult, but Thorn managed to get into the hut without bringing the doorframe down. Inside, the elder sat down on a small stool and beckoned for Thorn to join him. Summoning his stone chair, Thorn sat down, ignoring the displeased glares of the other Wolfkin that squeezed into the hut behind Captain Del'har.\"May I examine your ring?\" Elder Havva asked Thorn, his voice tired.\"Of course.\" Thorn handed it over, watching as the elder looked it over carefully, turning it this way and that. It took almost half an hour before Elder Havva was content. Slipping it back on his finger, Thorn smiled. \"Are you satisfied that I am Lord Greymane?\"\"Ha, you are not Lord Greymane,\" spat the large Wolfkin who had seated himself near Elder Havva. \"How can an outsider be Lord Greymane?\"Before anyone could respond, Captain Del'har's sword was out of its sheath, its razor sharp edge resting against the large Wolfkin's neck. Stunned, the large Wolfkin could not even swallow for fear of cutting his neck against the blade.\"Speak disrespectfully again and I'll have your head,\" Captain Del'har barked, his eyes narrowed in a murderous glare. He had been restraining himself all this time but was finally unable to hold himself back.Just as surprised as everyone else, Thorn stared at the captain. He had barely seen the captain move before the sword was out and pointed at the large Wolfkin. In fact, the move had been so quick that Thorn was not sure if he would have been able to avoid it. Glad that the captain was on his side, Thorn watched the rest of the crowd carefully, ready to draw his weapon as soon as someone made a move.\"Sir traveler, Gelish spoke rashly, but he is correct.\" Seeming entirely oblivious to the drawn weapon, Elder Havva spoke to Thorn. \"According to the ancient law, only a member of the Temple of the Moon can be appointed the position of Lord Greymane.*ding* Scanning the notification quickly, Thorn nodded. He had expected there to be some sort of challenge and, while he did not know exactly what 'Varied' rewards were, he guessed that it would have to do with his performance.\"The ancient laws must  be upheld,\" Thorn's deep voice rumbled around the hut. \"Captain, stand down.\"Pleasant surprise showed in Elder Havva's eyes as he heard Thorn's words. Normally, travelers were much more forceful about getting their way, so Thorn's comment caught him off guard.\"Elder, I respect the ancient rules, but understand that I am here to claim the allegiance of the Wolfkin, as is my right.\" Elder Havva held up a clawed hand, silencing the murmurs that broke out at Thorn's declaration.\"I will not deny that the title of Lord Greymane will grant you the allegiance of the Wolfkin race, but that assumes you can gain the title.\"\"You mistake me. According to the Code of the Wolf, the Ring of the Wolf Lord grants the title of Greymane. As the possessor of the ring, taken through a challenge of combat from the last Lord Greymane, there is no question as to my legitimacy. As the Temple Elder, you have the right to challenge for my position, by direct combat or by proxy combat. You do not have the right to deny me my authority. The Greymane's rule is unshakable.\"The ancient laws you speak of say nothing about Lord Greymane being a member of the Temple. Rather, it only gives the right of trial by combat to the Temple Elder. It matters not to me whether the Temple of the Moon nominates a challenger, but it must be understood that they are a challenger. I hold the title.\" As Thorn's deep voice echoed around the hut, a subtle pressure spread with it forcing, down the raised hackles of the Wolfkin in the room. The pressure was not heavy, but firm, an unquestionable authority that radiated from Thorn, suppressing everyone else in the room. Even Captain Del'har was forced back slightly, his grip tightening on his sword as if it might slip from his fingers. Only Elder Havva was able to remain unmoved in the face of Thorn's aura.Looking around at the others in the hut, Elder Havva gave a strained smile. He had to admit that there was something to what this large traveler said, but more importantly, the way he said it carried obvious weight. \"How do you know the Code of the Wolf?\" Gelish asked, his voice much milder than before.\"I read it.\" Thorn retrieved the book he had picked up in Davyos' Fall and held it up for all to see. \"The ancient laws are quite interesting.\"\"You went to the cursed city?\" Excitement radiating from his eyes, Elder Havva stood up abruptly. \"What did you find there? Are our people still there?\"\"I did go there, but I'm sorry, the city is empty and looks to have been empty for years. The temple to Hati there had been overtaken by werewolves.\"\"Karrandras.\" The excitement faded away from the Elder's face as quickly as it had come and he sat back down on his seat.\"Correct. The Betrayer had corrupted the temple and turned those inside into his worshipers.\" Pausing for a second, Thorn looked around at the angry faces of the surrounding Wolfkin. The thought of the Temple being corrupted obviously upset them, and suddenly he was surrounded by a lot of sharp teeth. Feeling slightly nervous, Thorn kept his face impassive and quickly added, \"The temple has been cleansed and restored to proper worship of Hati.\"At Thorn's words, murmurs arose from the others in the room, only stopping when Elder Havva held up his trembling hand.\"We stray from the main purpose. If you wish to hold the title of Greymane, you must pass the challenge of the Temple of the Moon. If you wish for the allegiance of the Wolfkin, you must convince us that you are worthy of the title.\" Thorn rose to his feet, towering above the seated Wolfkin. His head brushing the ceiling, Thorn's face broke into a wide grin.\"I would like nothing better.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**If you've enjoyed what you read and are interested in reading more, please consider supporting me on www.patreon.com/SethRing where you can read all of Book #2 and advanced chapters from Book #3.

Stripped to the waist, his body adorned with countless runic motifs, he stood calmly in a large stone ring. Crowds of Wolfkin surrounded the ring, talking quietly to each other as they waited for Elder Havva to announce the challenger. The old Wolfkin looked up at the sky, his eyes cloudy, lost in thought. That afternoon, after agreeing to the fight, Thorn had been led away by Elder Havva to prepare for the ritual challenge. Behind the village, there was a small hollow with a short waterfall and a deep pool. Ice cold water streamed down from the snow-capped peaks that surrounded the village. \"Please wash yourself. I will return with your garments for the trial. It may take a little longer than normal, as I don't know that we have anything in your size. Your clothing is currently being made.\"\"No problem.\" Thorn waved his hand as the elder shuffled off into the forest. On the way over, Elder Havva had explained how the ritual combat would work and the various rituals that had to be completed before the combat could start. Wading into the pool after stripping down, Thorn washed. The water was so cold that it stung, but Thorn's physical resistance made it bearable. After cleaning his body, Thorn dried himself off with a large towel from his inventory and, wrapping it around his waist, sat down to wait for Elder Havva, who had not yet returned. As he waited, Thorn thought carefully about the plans that he had made. While the first half of his plan for the valley had gone well, Thorn knew that the real challenges were only beginning. According to the message that he had gotten, Mina and Akira had almost finished mapping the valley, and Thorn was starting to think about how he was going to make sure he kept control of it. Velin's source in Ragnarok said that the Crimson Snakes were on their way to the valley, which did not give him much time to prepare defenses. Still, if he could recruit the Wolfkin, Thorn would have a decent fighting force. \"My apologies for making you wait, sir traveler.\" Elder Havva approached two female Wolfkin behind him. \"We have procured clothing that will fit you.\"\"Um, thanks.\" Taking the pants and sash from one of the ladies, Thorn was very glad that Nova Terra had an option for instantly equipping gear. \"Once you are dressed, please sit so we can draw the holy runes.\"It was only now that Thorn realized that the other lady was holding a tray with various brushes and pots of pungent paints as well as a stone glowing with a pale light. Curious, he equipped the pants and sash, tossing his oversized towel into his inventory, and knelt down. Even kneeling he was almost as tall as the two Wolfkin women. Elder Havva took a brush from the case and dipped it into one of the pots on the tray, picking up the glowing stone with his other hand. Tapping the end of the brush on the stone, a sliver of the pale light slipped from the stone to shroud the brush's bristles.The old Wolfkin shuffled around Thorn, his blurry eyes scanning Thorn's body. Silence returned to the edge of the pool, the only sound the soft splash of the waterfall. Realizing that Elder Havva had stopped behind him, Thorn opened his eyes. The elder was frozen in place, his eyes fixed on the tattoos that ran across Thorn's left arm and chest. Curious, Thorn looked down, his own eyes widening in shock.At some point, the barbaric-looking but meaningless tattoos that he had added at character creation had changed. Among the lines of the tattoo were figures woven together in a wolf and moon motif. A full moon with the silhouette of a howling wolf dominated his chest, sitting over his heart. Moving left, the moon could be seen in various stages, surrounded by hunting wolves. The wolf tattoos were dark but held a metallic shimmer, reminding Thorn of Hati's fur, while the moons were a pale silver, almost glowing. It took almost ten minutes before Elder Havva started moving again. When he did, his first action was to put the brush back on the tray and pick up another, thicker brush. Closing his eyes, Thorn waited for Elder Havva to begin drawing, completely missing the looks of shock in the eyes of the two women behind the elder.The drawing of the runes took almost three hours to finish, completely draining the glowing stone in the process. When Thorn finally stood up, they covered his whole torso, so tightly drawn that they looked like a solid mass from a distance. \"What are these drawings for?\" Thorn asked as he examined himself. In retrospect, he realized that he should have asked before the runes had covered his body. \"They signify your status as the Greymane and call for Hati to bless the winner of the challenge.\" Elder Havva coughed. \"They use the power of the moonstone to call the favor of Hati. Were you a Wolfkin, they would strengthen your abilities.\" His figure hunched even more than before, it was as if he had aged years in the last three hours. After a moment of rest, the old Wolfkin shuffled through the woods, Thorn and the women trailing behind him.The ring where the trial would take place was located in front of the statue of Hati at the center of the village. Twenty-five feet in diameter, the stone ring was slightly depressed, sitting about four inches below the rest of the village common area. Thorn could not tell if that was by design or if time had caused the ring to sink down into the earth. The ring itself was not completely flat, but it was clean and showed signs of having been swept that very morning, giving testament to how often the ring was used.Standing on the cracked and uneven stone ring, Thorn idly wondered what stories the ring might be able to tell if it could talk. It had undoubtedly witnessed a large part of the history of the Wolfkin race, weathering the sunshine and rain of the changing eras, to mention nothing of the blood and sweat of those who practiced atop it. At the far end of the ring stood the village altar. Made of dark, stacked stones, it was four feet high with soft edges, worn by the wind and rain of countless seasons. Atop the altar stood a statue of Hati made of the same dark stone, meticulously polished. The statue was surprisingly lifelike, exactly matching the image Thorn had in his head of the giant wolf god.  After a few moments, the murmurs fell silent and the crowds parted, revealing the large Wolfkin, Gelish. Dressed in a pair of loose pants with a green sash around his waist, Gelish was well built and would have been imposing if he had not been standing across from a Titan. Seeing the Wolfkin warrior pad into the ring, Thorn stepped forward, standing a full head above his opponent.\"The ancient law grants the Temple Elder the right of trial by combat.\" Elder Havva's blurry eyes stayed on the sky, his quivering voice carrying over the silent crowd as he recited the rules from memory. \"As the laws command, the trial of combat is a trial of skill, not a battle to death. As such, using any weapons but those that Hati has graced us with shall constitute defeat. The victor of the trial shall be the combatant who incapacitates their opponent. A combatant who kills or cripples their opponent shall be executed according to the law.\"As the laws grant, the Temple Elder will pass the right of trial by combat to their eldest disciple. I, Havva, Moon Temple Elder, hereby claim my right to contest for the position of Greymane. I will engage in combat by proxy, nominating Gelish, Head Disciple of the Moon Temple, as the combatant in my stead. This trial shall be held under Hati's all-seeing eye.\"As his voice faded away, the Temple Elder turned to the statue of Hati atop the altar and bowed, chanting a prayer under his breath. For a moment, nothing happened, and the crowd remained frozen in place. Just as Thorn was about to scratch his head, the statue's eyes glowed silver, casting a pale light over the stone ring. \"The great Walker of the Night, Hati has agreed to stand witness to this trial. Should the rules be violated, Hati will punish the offender. May the challenger come forward.\" Shuffling out of the ring, Elder Havva stood next to the altar as he waited for Gelish to enter the ring.\"I, Gelish, Head Disciple of the Moon Temple, accept the honor bestowed on me by the Moon Temple Elder. I enter the ring of combat to challenge...\" Here Gelish stopped suddenly, realizing that he did not know his opponent's name. He had been so caught up in denying the traveler's title that he had never paused to ask.\"Thorn.\" Thorn's deep voice rumbled out encouragingly.\"Uh...Thorn, the current Greymane, for the title of Greymane.\" Gelish tried to finish strong, but the verbal stumble in the middle of his challenge had sucked the momentum out of it. Around him the murmurs grew again as the crowd began to whisper to each other. Taking a step forward as the now familiar excitement began to build in his chest, Thorn spoke, his rumbling voicing silencing the crowd as it echoed around the fighting ring.\"I, Thorn, Lord Greymane, the Moon Wolf, accept the challenge.\" Fifteen feet apart, Thorn and Gelish stared each other down, the tension in the air growing thick. The large Wolfkin flexed his fingers, his sharp claws glinting in the last vestiges of twilight. Like Thorn, his furred torso was covered in dense runic lines that glowed silver in the fading light. As the sun finally slipped below the horizon, the clouds faded away, revealing the bright silver moon in its full glory. The light from the moon landed on the ring, bending around the two combatants, chasing their shadows away. The setting was barbaric, but there was an elegance to the picture as well. Two rune-covered warriors engaged in a contest of strength, using nothing but that which their god had granted them.For a moment, Thorn considered attacking, but then he recalled the words that Elder Havva had spoken as they walked back from the pool. The elder had assured him that he would know when the fight was to start and that he must restrain himself until that point. Thorn had been very confident going into this fight, but now, standing on the moonlit ring, facing Gelish's razor claws and large teeth, Thorn was starting to get nervous. Along with that nervousness, burning excitement was building in Thorn's chest, as well. Suddenly, a cloud passed over the moon, briefly blocking its light and, for an instant, Thorn imagined the moon had turned into Hati's giant eye, blinking at him. Just as swiftly, the moon's gaze returned, and Hati's majestic voice echoed clearly.[Begin.]Gelish, waiting for the signal, sprang into action. Brandishing his claws and baring his teeth, he dashed forward, slashing from the left. Thorn was no slower, settling into his combat stance and slapping out with a backhand to deflect the incoming blow. As their attacks connected, Gelish realized that going up against Thorn in a contest of strength would be a fatal mistake. Thorn's power was beyond overwhelming, and there was no way the Wolfkin could confront it directly.Jumping to the side, he slashed out with a low kick, cutting through Thorn's pants and leaving a line of blood on Thorn's shin. The giant responded by pressing the attack, stepping forward and launching a sweeping kick of his own. Ducking impossibly low, Gelish scrambled back along the uneven stone, trying to get out of Thorn's attack range. Unfortunately for him, Thorn's size made that almost impossible and, with a single step, Thorn had once again closed the distance. As Gelish jumped back, Thorn caught him with a glancing blow that sent the large Wolfkin flying, tumbling head over heels across the ring.The Wolfkin stood, shedding dust, his fur bristling. Gelish was the head disciple of the Temple of the Moon and had never been so humiliated in his life. He could easily fight any three of his fellow disciples, but now he was struggling against a single traveler. No matter how large Thorn might be, he could not accept that he was having so much trouble fighting him.With a growl, Gelish flexed his clawed hands and raised them toward the shining moon. Silver streams of light gathered around his fingers, causing the rest of the ring to dim for a moment. The runes along his hands and forearms ignited, burning with a flickering silver flame. The flames glimmered dangerously, causing Thorn to tense slightly as he recalled the magic flames that Bluefire had used in their spar. Without any armor, Thorn had no defense against the magical flames. His worry was reinforced as Gelish jumped forward, his flame covered claws accompanied by a dangerous whooshing sound as the flames devoured the air.Thorn would have liked to abandon the thought of blocking the blow, but his large size, which had just provided him with an advantage, now worked to his detriment. Knowing that he could not get away, Thorn abruptly surged forward, punching out with his large fist. \"Better to trade blow for blow and rely on my endurance,\" Thorn thought as he struck out.Thorn's fist met Gelish's flaming claws with a bang, the force of the blow sending a ring of dust and flame into the air. For a moment, their figures were obscured from view by the explosion, and the crowded Wolfkin could only wait with bated breath. As the dust and flames settled, the two combatants were revealed, their ragged forms separated by five feet.Gelish looked like he had come out of the exchange on top. Though the flames on his hands had dimmed significantly, he was otherwise unhurt. He stood, gulping in huge breaths of air, his bloodshot eyes fixed on Thorn, whose figure looked much worse for wear. Thorn's large body, still imposing, was fixed solidly where they had struck each other. As the dust cleared, a gasp rose from the crowd at the blood dripping to the ground.Thorn's right hand was a complete mess, the skin ripped to shreds. Deep cuts and charred skin gave testament to the ferocity of the blow he had blocked. The steady drip of blood beat a rhythm on the stone ring. At the sight of the blood, Gelish's bloodshot eyes grew completely red, and he threw back his head to howl up toward the moon.A thick sense of bloodlust seeped out from the large Wolfkin, and his figure swelled. Heavy, knotted muscle grew around his neck and shoulders, and his fingers, already wickedly clawed, grew longer and sharper. Watching him carefully, Thorn could see the awareness fade from Gelish's eyes, and a faint sense of disgust grew in his heart as Hati's voice echoed in his mind. [See for yourself the corruption that has grown in my children. The influence of the Betrayer has hidden itself deeply in their hearts, twisting their thoughts until what was once known as an abomination is now treated as a boon.]\u00a0-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**If you've enjoyed what you read and are interested in reading more, please consider supporting me on www.patreon.com/SethRing where you can read all of Book #2 and advanced chapters from Book #3. Come explore the world of Nova Terra and help me determine where the story goes.You can find out more about me at www.sethring.com", "The long howl echoed through the mountains, a tinge of madness creeping around its edge. The crowded Wolfkin responded in kind, frantic cheers echoing after the fading howl. Out of the corner of his eye, Thorn caught Elder Havva's frown, reinforcing the discomfort in his heart. Something was off.[Buried in the hearts of my children, the Betrayer's whispers have changed them. What used to be looked on with loathing is now held as a mark of pride. They have even taken to calling this bloodlust the Madness of the Moon and claimed that it comes from me. The Head Disciple of my temple has broken the prohibition. He has failed to abide by the ancient law, using the Betrayer's power in this trial.]As Thorn listened to Hati, the silver moon in the sky above the ring pulsed, a wave of silver flowing down like a stream of mercury. As it touched the runes on Thorn's body, they fused together, forming shining armor. The light healed the gouges on Thorn's hand as it flowed down his arms, thick armored bracers and gauntlets appearing a piece at a time, complete with claws.[Champion, cleanse this corruption. Break the influence of the Betrayer. Show them the true path.]Fully restored, Thorn faced the maddened Wolfkin, Hati's command ringing in his head. With a raging roar, Gelish stormed forward, emboldened by the cheers of the crowd. Once again the two warriors smashed into each other, shaking the ground with the force of their blows. Standing toe to toe, Thorn and Gelish traded blows. Gelish's strikes were wild and filled with ferocity. Much more measured, Thorn warded the blows off, focusing on driving the raging Wolfkin toward the edge of the ring. Thorn could tell that the tall Wolfkin had been entirely consumed by madness. Despite the heaviness of Thorn's strikes, his opponent shrugged them off like they were nothing. \"You cannot beat me, impostor! I am the true Greymane!\" Gelish screamed, veins bulging in his neck as he ripped into Thorn. A wild swing glanced off of Thorn's armored forearm, forcing him to jerk his head back to avoid a vicious claw. Annoyed, Thorn's eyes narrowed.Abandoning his attempt to contain his opponent, Thorn lowered his shoulder and lunged, planting his wolf-head pauldron square into Gelish's chest. Not giving him time to recover, Thorn grabbed the enraged Wolfkin by the shoulder and lifted him up into the air. Swinging him around like a rag doll, Thorn smashed Gelish into the ground so hard the stone ring cracked.The crowd, stunned by the sudden change in the pace of the fight, gasped in shock. The cheering Wolfkin lapsed into silence at the sight of their champion being thrown to the ground. Gelish struggled to his feet, still caught in the grip of his bloodlust. The silver runes on his fur shimmered and warped, taking on a tinge of red. Roaring out in rage, his body swelled further as he called deeper upon the Madness of the Moon. The silver runes turned completely red and began to burn into his fur, searing bloody paths into his body. Warped arcane symbols rose around Gelish, forming a crimson cage. Gasps rose from the crowd as the Wolfkin sensed that something was off. Near the statue of Hati, Elder Havva sighed, his head drooping even further. Inside the cage, streams of bloody energy poured into Gelish, causing him to scream in pain. His body writhed as the energy remolded him, causing sharp black spikes to grow from his spine and forearms. His form grew in size, quickly reaching Thorn's height as his muscles swelled.Impassively, Thorn watched as Gelish struggled and grew in the crimson cage. The Wolfkin warrior had lost almost any semblance of his former self by this point. Gone was the self-controlled monk that Thorn had faced initially. In his place was a corrupted monster from a nightmare. As Gelish's twisted form reached completion, the cage warped again, sinking into Gelish's body. The crimson brand gave off the copper and carrion stench of blood, sickening and weakening those that smelled it.Many among the tightly packed Wolfkin around the ring fell to their knees as the smell hit them, gagging and retching. The remaining Wolfkin shivered, their eyes turning bloodshot and their forms starting to twist and swell. Cursing, Thorn looked around, unsure what to do. All around the ring Wolfkin were either being consumed by rage or falling to the ground in pain.As if in response to the spreading corruption, the silver moon in the sky pulsed again, sending down a wave of silver energy to land on Thorn. With a ringing sound, it spread from him, purifying the putrid smell as it washed over the crowd. The Wolfkin who were being corrupted suddenly froze, their bloodshot eyes locking onto Thorn's shining figure.\"Well, this devolved quickly,\" Thorn muttered under his breath. Double checking that Captain Del'har was not turning into a corrupted monster, Thorn flexed his fingers. The newly corrupted Wolfkin from the crowd had their eyes fixed on him, and Thorn instinctively knew what was going to happen next. Sure enough, the moment the ringing sound faded, the corrupted Wolfkin lunged forward, teeth bared and claws out. Since the trial by combat was already ruined, Thorn did not hesitate to draw a weapon. Reaching for his tetsubo, Thorn only remembered that it had never been fixed when the massive metal spike he had ripped from the floor of Greymane Keep appeared in his hand. Dried blood and rust flaked from the spike's pitted surface as his gauntleted hand tightened around it. With no time to exchange it for an actual weapon, Thorn shrugged and threw back his head.[Wolf Lord's Howl!]The stunning effect of his howl stopped most of the charging Wolfkin mid-stride, and Thorn took care of the few that managed to shake off the effect with a sweeping blow of his massive metal spike. The whistle of the spike cutting through the air caused the Wolfkin to pause, but the corrupting influence of the bloodrage was too strong, and soon they surged forward again.Near the statue of Hati, Elder Havva bowed his head, chanting a long prayer. As the words spilled from his lips, they turned silver and hovered in the air, weaving together to form a semi-circular dome, covering everything within ten feet of the statue. The Wolfkin who were lucky enough to be inside the magical dome were not affected by the corrupting smell of blood and stood, waiting anxiously.Captain Del'har, his face locked in a furious scowl, was dragging two Wolfkin who had been curled up on the ground, retching, into the protected range of the statue. As soon as they entered the sphere, their symptoms vanished, and they were soon able to struggle to their feet, joining the others. The captain panted for a moment, taking in large gulps of air, his body relaxing. After a couple of breaths, he gathered his focus and plunged through the ward, racing as fast as he could toward another set of fallen Wolfkin.In the center of the ring, Thorn battled waves of corrupted Wolfkin, all the while keeping an eye on Gelish, who was still releasing the bloody scent. The mammoth corrupted Wolfkin paced at the edge of the ring, his bloodshot eyes fixed on Thorn, acidic saliva dripping from his large maw. No reason was left in his brain, but the cunning instincts of a feral wolf kept him from charging straight in. Instead, he waited, looking for that moment of weakness.Try as he might, Thorn could not help but hurt the attacking Wolfkin as he battered them back. Despite the cracking of their bones as they were thrown away, the Madness of the Moon made them all but immune to pain, and they were soon charging back into the fray. Claws flashed and teeth snapped as Thorn was nearly drowned in furry bodies.His mind working furiously, Thorn tried to figure out a solution that did not involve killing the attacking Wolfkin. While it would be easy for him to slaughter them wholesale, Thorn did his best to inflict as little damage as possible. The whole reason he had come was to bring the Wolfkin back as his subjects, and killing their warriors was contrary to that goal.Yet, it was apparent that, without some means of cleansing them of the corrupting influence of the Madness of the Moon, Thorn had no way to beat them while keeping them alive. With a grimace, Thorn ripped a Wolfkin who had managed to bite into his shoulder from his back, swinging his massive metal spike in a circle to try and gain some space. His temper growing shorter, Thorn was about to activate his [Wolf's Rage] ability and crush the offending Wolfkin in his hand to pulp when a flash of light caught his eye.Looking toward the end of the ring, Thorn saw Captain Del'har pull a pair of Wolfkin into the ward that Elder Havva had erected. As the two Wolfkin relaxed, no longer vomiting, a lightbulb went off in Thorn's head and, without any further hesitation, he threw the corrupted Wolfkin in his hand at the silvery circle of protection.The throw was strong and, no matter how much the corrupted Wolfkin flailed, he could not stop himself from flying through the air. Arms and legs waving, the poor native drew a neat parabola toward the statue of Hati, dropping into the silvery circle. As soon as he got within ten feet of the praying elder, the eyes of the statue of Hati flashed with a silver light.The corrupted Wolfkin let out a sudden scream, and a boiling sound erupted from his body as a dark red liquid evaporated from his fur. The pain did not last long, and the Wolfkin fell to the ground in a heap, unconscious. *ding* Hardly glancing at the notification, Thorn was ecstatic at the effect of throwing the corrupted Wolfkin near the statue of Hati. Putting away his weapon, Thorn lunged forward, grabbing two more of the corrupted attackers, tossing them toward the statue.For the next few minutes, a constant stream of flailing Wolfkin flew from the ring toward the statue, piling up into a heap of unconscious bodies. Captain Del'har watched in utter astonishment as the pile grew higher and higher, bodies falling out of the sky.Across the ring, Gelish was still pacing. Growing more frantic by the minute, the source of the corruption could instinctively tell that his window was growing smaller. Thorn's reach and strength made it simple for him to grab and throw the attackers to the statue. Each throw reduced the number of attackers, making it even easier for Thorn to grab the next one. Furious, the corrupted Head Disciple threw the last threads of caution to the wind and charged forward, howling out a challenge. The waves of sound washed over the ring, causing the few corrupted Wolfkin left to fall into a daze. As the howl reached him, Thorn could feel the sound trying to invade his mind and shake his spirit. For a brief moment, the sound wave grew louder and louder, threatening to become the only thing in Thorn's world.Shaking his head forcefully, Thorn broke away from the sound. He had only been shaken for the briefest of moments, but that was enough for Gelish to cross the ring. Despite the madness that had overtaken him, the Head Disciple of the Moon Temple had not forgotten his martial arts, and he unleashed a furious flurry of kicks, aiming to strike Thorn down.Six consecutive kicks smashed into Thorn, each stronger than the next. Grimacing in pain, Thorn could only raise his arms and legs to try and block the attacks. Gelish had not only grown bigger but stronger as well, and while his attacks were not quite enough to force Thorn back, each hit left him shaken.Having blocked the six kicks, Thorn threw out a palm strike, forcing Gelish to dodge backward. The corrupted Wolfkin jumped out of reach, taking his distance from Thorn's attack. Seizing the moment of reprieve, Thorn grabbed two of the stunned Wolfkin and threw them onto the pile by the statue. Just like the others, they landed with a thud, agonizing cries spilling from their lips as the corruption in their bodies boiled out of them. Furious that his opponent was taking time to deal with the other Wolfkin, Gelish howled and rushed forward again. This time, Thorn was ready for him and lashed out with a kick of his own, barely missing the charging Wolfkin as he ducked.Using the momentum of the kick, Thorn planted his foot and snapped out another kick, catching Gelish off-guard. Thorn's massive foot connected solidly, visibly compressing the Wolfkin's chest. Amid the snap and crackle of ribs shattering, Gelish went tumbling backward. Earning some breathing room, Thorn used it to throw the last few corrupted Wolfkin into the ward of purification.Just as he reached the last one, the corrupted Wolfkin woke from his dazed state and attempted to bite Thorn's hand as it reached for him. Annoyed, Thorn's grab turned into a slap, sending the just recovered Wolfkin right back into a stunned state. Hoisting him up, Thorn tossed him onto the pile.*ding* Reading the notification, Thorn smiled in satisfaction. There was something really pleasing about completing quests. A quick glance around showed that all of the affected Wolfkin had been dealt with, so his full attention settled on the source of the corruption. Thorn's eyes locked on Gelish, who was still trying to regain his feet after taking the bone-breaking kick.Unhurried, Thorn walked across the ring, his massive figure shining under the moonlight. His silver armor was scratched and dented, and his body was wounded in multiple places, yet somehow the damage simply made him look more heroic. Sensing his imposing presence approaching, the wounded Wolfkin looked up in alarm. He had barely made it to his feet when a massive hand reached out, gripping him by the neck and lifting him bodily from the cracked stone ring. Choking, Gelish's crazed eyes stared at the giant who held him up.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**If you've enjoyed what you read and are interested in reading more, please consider supporting me on www.patreon.com/SethRing where you can read all of Book #2 and advanced chapters from Book #3.

Above the worn stone ring, the bright silver moon hung low in the dark, star-dotted sky. A light breeze kicked up a bit of dust, blowing past Thorn's silver clad figure. Held in his outstretched arm, a hulking, brutish monster wriggled with the last vestiges of his strength, unable to withstand Thorn's might.Behind him, the statue of Hati stood atop the black stone altar, shining eyes fixed on Thorn. At its feet, countless Wolfkin warriors lay, groaning and cursing, their forms without strength. Next to them stood a tough-looking Wolfkin in dusty armor, his hand resting on his sheathed sword, protecting an elderly Wolfkin mumbling prayers.In the sudden stillness, Thorn heard the wind most clearly. It slid around the ring and wrapped around him, climbing from his feet to his head. With the wind, a faint voice rose in Thorn's heart, whispering quietly in his ear.'Kill him. If you don't, he'll recover and challenge your rule. Leading the Wolfkin is your right, ruling them is your destiny. You must crush anything that stands in the way of that. Otherwise, those around you will make use of your weakness. You must rule them tightly, or they will turn on you.'The whisper grew in volume, causing Thorn's hand to twitch, squeezing Gelish's neck until the bones in his spine creaked.'That's right. Just one simple movement to smash out dissension before it grows. If you leave him alive, he will not thank you. He'll just lead his race to fight your rule. Kill Him. KILL HIM!'Shivering, Thorn's hand started to tighten again when a thread of clarity bloomed in his mind, and his body froze. His eyes, which had briefly flashed blood red, returned to their normal color, and Thorn woke from his daze with a start. Loosening his grip, he turned and dragged the defeated Head Disciple to the ward of protection around the statue. As Thorn walked into the influence of the ward, a cool feeling washed over him, like a summer night's breeze. Thorn could feel it driving away another influence which had clung to him like thick, sticky syrup without him realizing it. Feeling much better, he held Gelish until the enlarged Wolfkin had been purified and had regained his normal size. Tossing him onto the pile, Thorn was happy to hear the sound he was waiting for.*ding* Reading the last line of the quest, Thorn was taken aback. A class? Why was he getting a class? Wasn't the point of the quest to gain the allegiance of the Wolfkin? What did getting a class have to do with it? His brow furrowed, Thorn stared at the pop up that followed his quest completion notice. [Accept it, my avatar.]Just as Thorn was about to hit no, turning down the class, a majestic voice echoed in his ears. Startled, Thorn paused and looked up. The statue of Hati that had stood frozen atop the black altar shivered with a silver light. As the light ran over the well polished statue, its fur began to tremble in the night breeze. Warm eyes looked down on Thorn as the wolf came to life. After a few seconds, the wolf looked at Elder Havva, whose eyes were screwed tightly shut. The old Wolfkin had certainly heard the voice of Hati, but rather than look up, he crouched even lower, prostrating himself in front of his deity. Next to the trembling elder, Captain Del'har fell to one knee, saluting with with his fist over his chest, his head bowed. After a moment of staring blankly, Thorn snapped out of his daze and accepted the class with a shrug. \"In for a penny, in for a pound, I guess,\" thought Thorn. While it was not what he had planned, everything Hati had given him thus far had served him well. *ding* After Thorn accepted the class, the wolf turned its eyes back on him. Nodding its head in what Thorn could only assume was appreciation, the wolf stood still, its fur reverting to stone once again. As it changed, Hati's voice rang out once more.[Thorn, Lord Greymane, Avatar of Hati, Disciple of the Moon Temple, has won the challenge. The ancient laws have been upheld and the winner of the trial has been determined. Thorn has shown wisdom, restraint, and martial skill, saving the lives of many of his fellow disciples. For this, let him take the mantle of the inheritor.]*ding* Slowly, the radiance around the wolf faded, leaving behind the well-worn stone statue. The bright moon in the sky lost some of its silver luster, and the cloudless sky began to fill with dark clouds again. With a slight pop, the shining ward disappeared, and Elder Havva lifted his head toward the sky with a sigh.Fumbling around for his cane, he rose to his feet. Captain Del'har saw him struggling to stand and hastened to help the elder Wolfkin up. Around them, the collapsed Wolfkin struggled up as well. \"Greetings, Lord Greymane.\" His attitude totally different, Elder Havva bowed his head slightly as he faced Thorn. \"We have much to discuss regarding the words the Great Wolf spoke.\"*ding* Asking Captain Del'har to help organize the Wolfkin who were still trying to recover from their brush with the corruption from the Madness of the Moon, Thorn and Elder Havva sat down for a long talk. Settling himself on his rock seat, Thorn tried to wait as patiently as possible for the elderly Wolfkin, who was sitting in silence.It was obvious that the Temple Elder was having trouble adjusting to what had just happened. Thorn did not know if it was the fact that the temple's Head Disciple had turned against the teachings of the temple, embracing Karrandras the Betrayer's power. Or maybe it was the fact that Hati had manifested, speaking directly to Elder Havva. Either way, Thorn was on a tight schedule and was getting a bit impatient.\"Congratulations, Lord Greymane.\" Just as Thorn was about to start speaking, the elder began to talk. His voice was strained, but as he continued, his tone evened out and gained strength. \"You have successfully passed the ritual trial and will be properly recognized as the Greymane. The Great Wolf has also granted you the mantle of the Inheritor.\"\"What is that about?\" Thorn scratched his head.\"To properly understand all of this, please allow me to give you an overview of the temple. That should make it easier to understand. The Temple of the Moon has a simple ruling structure. A single Temple Elder rules over the temple. In this generation, I am the Temple Elder. You might think of the Temple Elder position as an Abbot. I oversee the direction of the temple, help make executive decisions, and approve rewards and punishments. \"Under the Temple Elder are the four Path Masters, each ruling one of the four courts. The courts are divided into the Dusk Court, Full Moon Court, New Moon Court, and Dawn Court. Inside the courts are the Chamberlains, Deacons, Night Walkers, and Disciples. Each court is responsible for overseeing one of the martial forms practiced by the disciples of the Temple of the Moon. When a new disciple is admitted to the temple, they choose a martial form and join the associated court. This determines what role they will take in the temple and what their training will be like.\"Your position in the temple is a bit different since you are both the Inheritor and Lord Greymane. The position of Inheritor is held by the disciple who is marked to succeed the Temple Elder as the next leader of the temple. For you to hold the title of Greymane as well as the title of Inheritor grants you significant responsibility and authority.\"\"I meant to ask about that.\" Thorn frowned lightly as he thought through what Elder Havva had told him. \"What is the role of Greymane? I thought that Lord Greymane was just the name of the individual who ruled the valley?\"\"Really, the position of Greymane is comprised of two parts.\" Elder Havva gestured to the ring on Thorn's finger. \"The first part is the appointed title, held by the bearer of the ring. The last temple-appointed Greymane was corrupted many years ago and fled the valley, taking the ring with him. The second part of the position is the ruler of the valley, also called Lord Greymane by the people of the valley. To truly hold the title of Greymane, one must have both the ring and take possession of the Wolf Throne in Greymane Keep.\"Historically, the temple was divided into two sides. There was a public side and a reclusive side. The temple itself did not involve itself in any mortal affairs, sitting apart from the world. However, as part of their training, all disciples would spend a period of time in the world as Night Walkers. The Greymane was not only the public Elder but also led the Night Walkers. Greymane Keep was the place the Night Walkers lived while outside the temple and acted as the public temple. According to the ancient law, the Greymane is the public-facing Temple Elder.\"\"Hold on, doesn't that mean that if I am both Greymane and Inheritor, I'll eventually be both the public and private Temple Elder?\"\"Yes.\" Elder Havva gave a long sigh. \"The elders are called the Full Moon Elder and the New Moon Elder. You are already the Full Moon Elder since you hold the title of Greymane. That is why only I, as the New Moon Elder, am able to challenge you.\"\"Huh.\" Scratching his head, Thorn was lost for words. For a moment, silence fell over the hut where they were sitting as the two temple elders looked at each other.\"Regardless, we should now discuss the reason you came.\" Shaking his head, as if it could get rid of the depression that shrouded him, Elder Havva changed the topic.\"Sure.\" Thorn straightened and leaned forward slightly. \"A few days ago, I cleared the current Greymane Keep. From what I understand, the existing castle was built on the ruins of the Temple of the Moon. My goal in coming here is to gather the Wolfkin, leading them back to the valley to rebuild the temple. The valley will be gaining a spawn point, and I think it is a good opportunity for the temple to rejoin the world. I have all the resources necessary to rebuild the temple apart from the workers, and I was hoping that you would be able to help with that.\"\"Very well, we shall join you.\" Without pausing, Elder Havva nodded his head.\"Uh.\" Stunned, Thorn could only stare at the Temple Elder for a moment. He had expected some sort of negotiation and had planned out numerous convincing reasons why it would make sense for the Wolfkin to join him. In the face of Elder Havva's calm acceptance, they all fell flat, leaving Thorn tongue-tied. \"Don't be too surprised.\" Elder Havva shook his head with another drawn-out sigh. \"You are the Greymane, your words carry weight equal to mine. You have shown yourself to be a warrior beyond compare in the holy trial. That alone grants your voice power. You have joined the Temple of the Moon, an honor never before granted to one of another race. You joined by the command of our god no less, showing that you have Hati's favor upon you. You have taken up the mantle of the Avatar of Hati, becoming Hati's voice among us, tying yourself to our race with a bond that cannot be broken.\"Slowly rising to his feet, Elder Havva made his way to the door of the hut, leading Thorn out into the main square. The Wolfkin had gathered into a group on the stone ring, standing before the altar in neat rows. The elder blinked his muddled eyes as he watched them.\"Our people have dwindled over time. There are less than six hundred of us left, with only three hundred warriors. The mountains are good for hiding, but they do not allow us to grow. Since you have cleared the werewolf threat, it is time for our race to venture out. We will either flourish, or we will die. Either way, we will follow you.\"Taking in the crowd of Wolfkin, each standing over a large pack filled to the brim with their possessions, Thorn could not help but swallow. Everything they owned was on their backs. Even the statue of Hati that had watched over the stone ring was being carried with them. Bright eyes, filled with excitement and anticipation, stared at him from the crowd. Children peeked at him from behind their parent's legs, and elderly Wolfkin bent with age smiled excitedly. Facing the clear expectation of the crowd, the importance of what he was doing settled on Thorn. To Thorn, this was a game. A series of quests whose failure would not, ultimately, mean much. He could simply try his best and not worry about the result. His life was settled and secure. The staring eyes of the assembled Wolfkin told him that their lives were anything but. They were walking away from their homes, their lives, to follow him. Their hopes, their ambitions, were no longer their own. Instead, they were betting on him, pinning those hopes on the giant in front of them.\"Salute the lord,\" Captain Del'har's voice rang out. With a loud thud, all six hundred Wolfkin fell to one knee, saluting Thorn together. \"\"We greet Lord Greymane!\"\u00a0", "The voices of the bowing Wolfkin echoed off of the mountain. As the sound rolled around Thorn, he could almost feel the expectations, hopes, and ambitions that the greeting contained, further reinforcing the sense of weightiness that had settled on him. To him, this was a game, to the bowing Wolfkin in front of him, this was life.Shaking his head slightly, as if to get rid of the weight, Thorn gestured for his new subjects to rise. Taking a small step forward, he summoned his armor. Streaks of pale silver covered his body as his armor materialized, the wolf motifs glinting in the moonlight.\"I am Thorn, Lord Greymane, the Moon Wolf, Avatar of Hati, Inheriting Disciple of the Temple of the Moon. Tonight, I will lead you back to Greymane Valley. Back to your home. Together we will rebuild the Temple of the Moon and reestablish the order of the Night Walkers. You have persevered through the generations, holding fast to the ancient laws, serving Hati faithfully. The work will be hard, and we will face many enemies, but under the light of Hati's eye, we will be victorious.\"Cheering, the crowd shouldered their packs and turned to follow Captain Del'har, who led the way toward the valley. Thorn marched among them, his tall figure sticking out above them. As they moved, Thorn realized that the Wolfkin were well suited to travel. Even the young children could run well, their long legs allowing them to keep up.Rather than walk, the entire group jogged forward at a distance-eating pace, reminding Thorn of marathon runners. The group accelerated and decelerated as one, spurring one another on. In the middle of the group, Thorn had no trouble matching their tempo, as if an unseen chord bound them all together. At the front, Captain Del'har led the way. A little bit of searching soon revealed the truth. One of the abilities that Thorn had gained from his class granted him faster travel speed while moving with other disciples from the temple. Curious about the other abilities that he had gained, Thorn pulled up his status. On top of the [Inheritor] title that he had earned, the three abilities that his class had granted him were listed. Thorn also noticed that, rather than showing his conditions, his status now showed his class instead. Under his class he also found a line listing his allegiance as [Temple of the Moon]. Making a mental note to ask Velin about how allegiances worked, Thorn turned to his new abilities.The first ability granted by his new class was [Martial Form]. According to what Elder Havva had said, there were four martial forms taught by the temple. Each form corresponded to one of the four different courts of the temple and focused on a different set of skills. When a disciple first entered the temple, they would be assigned to a court. After gaining proficiency in the skills of that court, disciples would graduate to be Night Walkers and would leave the Temple of the Moon to adventure.Selecting the ability, Thorn was not surprised to see four windows pop up. He passed the time as they hiked through the mountains by reading through them one at a time. [Disciple] was an interesting class because it did not belong to a single category. Instead, the category of the class changed depending on which Court, and form, the disciple chose. Each form taught a proficiency and an active skill and, upon mastery, led to a Two Category Class. Initially attracted by the [Ranged Combat Proficiency], Thorn could only laugh as he thought of himself setting traps or trying to hide for ambushes. While he really liked the idea of being a highly mobile archer, it did not seem overly practical, considering his size. Dismissing the window, Thorn frowned slightly as he scanned the side of the mountain, watching the steady stream of Wolfkin in front of him. Despite the fact that they were currently climbing a steep slope, the group kept up a quick pace, only slightly slower than a jog. The Full Moon Form seemed to fit very well with his current abilities, though Thorn did not feel like he needed more toughness. Between his racial abilities and his size, Thorn felt pretty tough compared to most things.Plus, as the Avatar of Hati, he already had magical armor that did not require any proficiencies. While he could not deny the appeal of the combat category, Thorn was confident that he did not need a class to be able to stand toe to toe with even the best warriors. Smirking at the memory of his most recent fight, Thorn pulled up the next form. The opposite of the direct Full Moon Form, the New Moon form suited Thorn even less. After spending a couple of fanciful minutes imagining himself turning invisible and popping out behind people, Thorn closed the window. As cool as it would be to take the path of an assassin, it was not his destiny. The Dawn Form was the form with the greatest appeal to Thorn at the moment. He had been leaning toward finding a leadership class, and this seemed to fit the bill nicely. Bonuses to speech and cognitive buffs would be helpful, not only in leading the Wolfkin, but in his efforts to put together his own team. It had become more and more apparent to Thorn that, if he wanted to leave a lasting impact on the world of Nova Terra, he was going to have to gather others around him, and taking the Leadership path would help with that.The [Oration Proficiency] intrigued him, so he opened up the description. Both [Oration Proficiency] and [Rallying Cry] would only strengthen Thorn's leadership, so he selected the Dawn Form, watching as his ability changed to [Martial Form: Dawn]. With his form selected, Thorn looked at the last ability his [Disciple] class granted him. *status* The trip back to the keep took a bit under three hours due to the [Pack Travel] racial ability that the Wolfkin possessed, an astounding feat considering the number of young and elderly in the crowd. When the spires of the keep came into view above the trees, the jogging Wolfkin broke into cheers, increasing their speed.Leading them through the gate, Thorn had them set up camp in the courtyard while he went to bed. Velin and Mina had logged out, leaving a message that they would be back in the morning, so Thorn settled in for what was left of the night. Staying up all night was not a problem, but some habits were hard to break.The sun was shining brightly through the narrow stone window when Thorn woke up the next morning. Yawning, Thorn rose from the floor where he had slept and stretched his body, the yawn changing into a grumble as his arms hit the ceiling. Most of the keep's ceilings were just over nine feet tall, which annoyed Thorn to no end. Opening up his friends list, Thorn saw that both girls had logged in, so he made his way down to the courtyard.Velin was chatting quietly with Elder Havva and the captain while Mina stood nearby, entertaining some of the Wolfkin children by creating small creatures with ice. Akira, sitting on Mina's head, saw Thorn as he walked out of the keep's double doors. Chirping with excitement, she dashed over, bounding up Thorn's body and hopping excitedly up and down on his shoulder.[Master! Master! You're back! Why'd you leave? Why didn't you bring me? I don't want to stay with that older sister! I want to stay with you!]\"Haha. Hi, Akira.\" Pleased to see his battle pet, Thorn fished out a pastry from his inventory. Stroking her fur as she chattered at him, Thorn walked over to Velin and the two Wolfkin.\"Greetings, Lord!\"Upon seeing him, the Wolfkin, who were standing around the yard, dropped to one knee, shouting out together with one voice. Slightly taken aback, Thorn grimaced. Somehow, he just could not get used to this. Seeing that the Wolfkin remained kneeling, he frowned.\"Rise.\" Nodding to the Elven War Priestess, Thorn greeted Elder Havva and Captain Del'har. \"We've got plenty to do, so let's get started. Velin, have you filled everyone in on our situation?\"\"No, I was just about to start.\" Velin shook her head, her serious eyes fixed on Thorn. \"Would you like to?\"\"No, go ahead.\"\"Alright. As I was saying, we are in a precarious position, though it certainly is not as hopeless as it was. We have ten days until the shrine at Greymane Village is activated as a respawn point. Once that happens, the valley will be announced as a new player location. At the same time, we will see an influx of Wolfkin players. In fact, if trends hold, we will see at least five million Wolfkin players over the next year. Every time Nova Terra releases a new playable race, we see large influxes of people buying race change tokens.\"We have three main considerations. One, holding the valley. We can treat this as two tasks. First, the keep contains a control point. Currently, the throne is set as the control point. If enemies hold the throne, they can forcefully take control of the keep. Second, the shrine in Greymane Village. Controlling the spawn point will grant an advantage to the team that holds it, since they can allow their own forces to spawn while blocking others. This concern has to do with our immediate enemy.\"The guild Ragnarok operates in this area and has been looking for the valley for the last two weeks. It is highly likely that their scouts will find us within the next five days and that their main force will not be far behind. Ragnarok is a fairly large guild, but, thankfully, the group operating in this area is no more than 1500 players and supporting natives.\"\"1500? That's a pretty sizable group,\" Thorn muttered, looking at the 200 Wolfkin he had.\"Correct. 250 Crimson Snakes, 250 player guards, and approximately 1000 native guards. The force is not a cohesive army, though all of the players have a reasonable level of skill.\"\"Alright, continue.\"\"Apart from our approaching enemy, we have two other considerations. Infrastructure and population. I mention these together because they are so closely linked. Currently, the valley has been almost entirely reclaimed by the forest. This is to our advantage, as it will prevent mounted troops and heavy siege weapons from being brought in. At the same time, this is a problem for us because we don't have the infrastructure to set up a profitable territory.\"A profitable territory needs food and money to operate, and the facilities to generate them. However, to build the facilities, we need population. To generate population, we need excess food, money, and time. As you can see, this is an issue for us. Because of our approaching enemy, we do not have the time necessary to build defensive fortifications, and we do not have the population to recruit guards or soldiers.\"This is our basic situation. We lack infrastructure and population and have an approaching enemy. However, we do have a number of things going for us.\" Velin paused and looked at Thorn. \"First, we have absolute command due to your position as Lord Greymane. That cannot be underestimated. Second, we have about 200 combat-ready disciples from the Temple of the Moon, courtesy of Elder Havva.\"Mina did not find the bandits, but according to reports from the village, they're a group of 100 former soldiers who are operating on the edge of the valley. Since they were once soldiers, we might be able to absorb them and bring them back into our army. We also have almost 50 hunters from Greymane Village. While this combat force is not nearly as large as our enemy's, it is better than nothing. Third, we have guild backing of our own. If Atlas is willing to inject funds into this territory, then we might be able to squeeze through.\"", "Stepping over to one of the walls of the keep, Velin projected her map onto it, zooming in to show the valley. Three spots were marked out in red, eye-catching among the many other markings and notes on the map.\"The valley is a naturally defensive position with a single entrance, a pass between the Twins. This means we have three important locations. First, we have the keep which holds the control node for the valley, located at the far end of the valley. At the other end we have the entrance to the valley. This is the only known way into the valley. Close to the pass, we have Greymane Village where the respawn point is located. We need a plan that will cover all three of those locations.\"Stepping forward, Thorn examined the map. Mina and Akira had finished mapping the whole valley in the day he was gone. After a moment of thought, he turned to Elder Havva.\"Elder, is there any significance in the positioning of the old temple?\"\"Hmmm? You mean here, where we stand?\" The elder peered around as he thought about it. \"No, not that I know of. The original temple was built on top of the village that our people originally settled. Over time, the village became the temple and a second village was started. That is where Lord Greymane and the Night Walkers were based. When the temple was destroyed, the Greymane of that generation built this keep.\"The temple will exist wherever the Wolfkin build the altar. Tradition has dictated that the statue of Hati watches over the valley, but when we fled the valley, we moved it with us, carrying it to the village in the mountains. You would know better than I if Hati required the altar to be constructed in a specific place.\"\"Good.\" Thorn grinned. \"I'm going to be moving the temple.\"Moving the temple? What temple?\" During the conversation, Mina had wandered over. Now that there was a chance to jump in, she did not want to miss it.\"Here.\" Thorn's large finger landed on the entrance to the valley. \"We will place the Temple of the Moon in the pass that leads into the valley. I think it would make more sense to control the entrance then it would to try and control the rest of the valley. Frankly, if we can't control who gets into the valley, then there is almost no point in trying to hold the keep. On the other hand, this will allow us to keep a firm grip on the resources we've discovered.\"\"Oh, did you see that we found more of those glowing rocks when we were mapping?\"\"Yeah, I just noticed that. According to Elder Havva, it sounds like those stones are moonstones. The Wolfkin use them to improve their racial abilities. They will be a great source of income if we get a lot of new Wolfkin players. Thanks for mapping everything.\" Thorn smiled at Mina, and turned to look at Velin. \"If we want to build a fortress monastery in the pass, what do we need?\"\"Time, people, and money.\" Velin pulled out her notebook and began scribbling in it with a frown. \"There are a couple ways to build new buildings in Nova Terra. The first requires the labor to be performed in game and, so long as the material is available, costs nothing but time and effort. This is by far the most popular way to build. The other, less popular way is to pay for the game to construct a building from scratch. This would automatically create the structure in-game according to a blueprint that the player inputs. While this seems easier than building by hand, it is not a good option for us.\"\"Yeah, it's a trap.\" Mina tossed in from the side.\"Trap? What do you mean?\"\"The cost rises exponentially per feature you have the system build. It is much more cost effective to spend the money buying the materials and hiring workmen.\"\"But that takes time. Something we don't have the luxury of.\" Thorn's eyes locked on the Elven Priestess'.\"I don't think you are recognizing the depth of the cost. Building a house would bankrupt most people, let alone a castle. We should spend our effort on a defensive line. Or trying to negotiate.\"\"Negotiate?\" Thorn's voice dropped slightly.\"Yes. Ragnarok is not unreasonable. While we currently hold the valley, there is little chance that we will be able to keep it once the Crimson Snakes find it. I could use my connections to help us negotiate a split. Then we would at least be left with something.\" Noticing that her surroundings had become silent, Velin looked up from her writing to find Thorn staring at her with a dangerous look in his eyes.\"Velin, I am going to assume that you are making that suggestion out of your concern for our group's wellbeing.\" Thorn's deep voice was not loud but it still sent a shiver down the spine of everyone who heard it. Slowly lifting his hand, he planted a finger on the map. \"We will not negotiate. If Ragnarok wants to take something else from me, they will pay for it in blood. We build the new temple here.\"Palpable waves of force radiated from Thorn, causing everyone around him to instinctively cower. There was a bloody edge to him that had not been present the last time Velin had seen him. Rather than struggle against his aura, she quickly bowed her head.\"I'm sorry, I spoke out of turn. I did not think through the issue properly.\" Hearing her admit her mistake, Thorn's anger lessened, though a burning ember of discontent refused to be extinguished. Taking a deep breath, he did his best to soften his demeanor.\"Let's continue. Knowing that we lack time, what do we need to do?\"Finally free of the paralyzing aura, Mina was about to throw a fit until Velin caught her eye, giving a shake of her head. Biting her lip, the short Ice Witch scowled and stomped off. Ignoring her, Velin resumed where she had left off as if she had never brought up the idea of negotiating.\"Without time, we will need people and money. A lot of money. Nova Terra is not a pay to win game, despite the fact that money can be spent on an astounding number of items that grant advantage. Anything that can be purchased can be earned in-game, and the cost for purchasing through the store is beyond prohibitive. Building is a great example of that. A house costs a million credits base. Each room doubles the cost.\" Not seeing a response from Thorn, she sighed and continued.\"To top it off, there are no ready-made designs for sale. If we want to buy a castle, we'll need to buy plans. This will add expense as well. Prices for property blueprints are astronomical since it is assumed that only those who are too rich for their own goodwill bother paying the system to build.\"\"Money is not an issue. I'll handle that part. How do we submit the design?\"\"If you've ever accessed the Fantasia shops from inside Nova Terra, it is the same. There is an office that handles building requests.\"\"Thanks. I need to deal with Greymane Village and the bandits. Please organize the Wolfkin here and move everything of value to the entrance to the valley. I'd like you to organize them into groups and have them patrol outside the valley. We need to know when Angdrin gets here. I'll meet you in the pass in two days.\" Not waiting around to see how she took his commands, Thorn turned and left, heading for the throne room.Watching his broad back as he walked away, Velin closed her eyes and sighed. Furious, Mina ran up to her.\"How could he do...\"Before she could continue, Velin blocked her mouth.\"Leave it. We were the ones that disappointed him first. It is only reasonable that he be on his guard. Plus, I was overstepping my bounds, so it is only right for him to chide me.\"\"What? No way! This isn't how you treat friends.\"\"It's more complicated than that, Mina.\" Frowning, Velin lifted a hand to rub her temple. \"We're friends that picked our own interest first, friends who tried to take what was rightfully his. And now we're his employees.\"\"But...\" \"Leave it.\" Velin hugged her friend tightly. \"I know he said that everything could go back to normal, but it will take time. Time and effort. No matter how much he wants to pretend everything is okay, there are bound to be wounds. And if this is the only cost to regaining his trust, it is worth it. Now, let's get these Wolfkin organized.\"Inside the keep, Thorn was walking up the stairs glumly. His outburst seemed to have come from nowhere, blazing into existence before he could control himself. Even now, he could feel the uncomfortable burn of his anger, settled firmly in the pit of his stomach. He had not meant to take it out on Velin, but when she mentioned negotiating with Ragnarok, he had almost lost it completely. It had only been with supreme effort that he had not accused her of being a traitor right then and there. Despite the fact that he had managed to hold the words in, Thorn had no doubt that she had guessed exactly what he was thinking. \"So much for trusting,\" he sighed. Despite his nice-sounding words and his best intentions, he seemed to have fallen at the first pass. Walking into the throne room, Thorn pulled up the [RMS], immediately noticing that the population count had shot up by 500. After hunting around for a moment, he found the button to relocate the valley's control point. Hesitating for a moment, Thorn finally punched the no button. His plan was to handle the village first before he built the new temple at the entrance to the valley. With three to four days left to go before the enemy arrived, Thorn was confident that he had time to move the Control Point later. Having decided to wait, Thorn took stock of what he still needed to do. There were only a few days until the Crimson Snake scouts would start arriving, so he wanted to make sure that the important defenses were in place first. Not only did he have to relocate the temple, but he had to help rebuild Greymane Village and deal with the bandits. Truthfully, Thorn was not confident that they would be ready in time for the influx of players, which would complicate things immensely.Currently, the valley was largely unoccupied, which made controlling it fairly easy. However, if he could not fight off Ragnarok and consolidate his control before players started spawning, it would become infinitely more complicated. Taking a deep breath, Thorn headed for Greymane Village. It was time to get to work.The forest was quiet and cool. Tall trees filtered out the heat of the morning sun, as thin beams of light spotted the forest floor. Walking along with Akira in his arms, Thorn took a moment to appreciate the peacefulness. Soon this peace would be broken.\"How do you like our new home?\" asked Thorn, petting Akira's furry head.\"Master, it is so wonderful. The trees and places to climb and the trees! I love it. Master, I am going to bring my whole family to visit! Can I?\" asked the excitable furball, bouncing up and down.\"Haha, of course. Your family can visit any time. This is your home after all.\"\"Oh, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.\" With a flick of her tale, Akira flashed to a nearby tree, where she scratched a little symbol into the bark. \"This tree is mine! And this tree is mine! This tree is mine! I claim this tree!\"Startled, Thorn watched as Akira bounced from tree to tree, marking them with a small symbol while proudly claiming all the trees as her own. With a chuckle, Thorn got down to thinking about how he was going to find the bandits. Ultimately his goal was to keep them from preying on others in the area, and based on what Elder Thomas had said, he had a couple of ideas of how to deal with them. As he solidified his plans, Thorn idly pulled the large spike that he had gained from his epic showdown with the Greater Werewolf out of his inventory. Six feet long and still covered in grime and dried blood, it tapered from eight inches in width down to a blunt point. The large end that had been buried in the ground still had bits of mortar on it, but they soon crumbled off, revealing a dark pitted metal underneath. Slightly less than halfway up the spike and right before the point there were thick rings that still held bits of chain hanging from them. Hefting the spike in his hands, Thorn decided to find a blacksmith who could refine it into an actual weapon.Swinging it through the air created a very satisfying thrumm, and Thorn thought it a weapon particularly suited for his strength. Continuing to practice his swings according to the rhythm Master Sun had taught him, Thorn walked on through the forest until he got close to Greymane Village. Taking a break from swinging his spike, Thorn called for Akira again. It took a while since she was still frantically staking claim to all the trees they had come across, but eventually, Thorn got her to come over with the promise that she could have as many trees as she wanted later.\"Akira, Ailuridae have pretty good noses. Do you think you could find some humans for me that are not part of this village?\" Thorn asked, gesturing to the town in front of him. \"They'll be a big group. More than 100 people. And they will have weapons and armor as well.\"\"Pretty good? Ha, Ailuridae noses are the best! And I'm the best Ailuridae!\" Arching her back proudly, Akira turned up her nose at Thorn. \"Just you watch how fast I find them!\" And without another word, she shot off to the village. Strolling in after her, Thorn was pleasantly surprised to find that the village had already changed quite a bit. It had only been half a day since he had granted Thomas the money to rebuild the town, but based on how busy everyone was, they were not wasting any time.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**If you've enjoyed what you read and are interested in reading more, please consider supporting me on www.patreon.com/SethRing where you can read all of Book #2 and advanced chapters from Book #3.

Yet, despite the chaos, there was a semblance of what the town would become beginning to emerge. Most of the old buildings had been demolished and were now being reconstructed from massive piles of material that the elder had purchased. Additionally, the town's ramshackle wall had been pulled down, and an old stone wall was being rebuilt farther out. Before, the town had only consisted of a few buildings, but now, in addition to the jail, tavern, and blacksmith's shop, there was a large stable, three empty buildings that could be used for stores, a barracks, and a shrine covered in moon and wolf motifs. All of this was arranged around a new main street, complete with cobblestones.Seeing the villagers running around like crazy, Thorn grinned and joined in the fun. At first, it took a while to keep the villagers from stopping their work to salute him when he came by, but once they saw Thorn lifting massive stones to rebuild the wall by himself, they jumped back in with renewed vigor. For Thorn, it wasn't particularly hard work, but it was very satisfying. The warm sun beating down on him as he split, moved and fitted the stone reminded Thorn of the pleasant days he had spent in the quarry, and he couldn't help but smile at the memory.With Thorn, they made astounding progress and had a good half of the wall complete by the time night fell. Akira had run off into the forest to hunt for the bandits, and through his connection with her, Thorn could tell she was somewhere northwest of the village. Joining the village for a meal, he was happy to hear that a message had been sent out to attract settlers, and the village Elder had actually already left to recruit people from some of the local cities.Waking the next morning completely rested, Thorn had just walked out of the inn when he spotted a small wagon being pulled by a slow moving mule creaking into the village. Sitting in the driver's seat was an old man dressed in slightly ragged robes with a prominent wolf and moon symbol on his chest. Stepping out into the road, Thorn raised a hand in greeting.\"Hello,\" Thorn smiled as he walked in front of the mule, \"welcome to Greymane. Not too often we get visitors. Might I know who you are?\"\"Thanks,\" replied the robed man, seemingly unperturbed by Thorn's size and confrontational manner. \"I am Father Jansome, a priest of Hati, the Lord of the Night. I was dispatched to attend the newly built shrine in this... town?\" Looking around at the building that had already resumed, Jansome's statement morphed into a question.\"We're expanding.\" Grinning as he took in the changes taking place, Thorn offered Jansome a handshake. \"Welcome to town, priest. I am Thorn, the new Lord Greymane. I know a bit about Hati myself, but maybe you can help me turn that little bit into a bit more.\" Thorn's last statement earned him a quizzical look from the priest.\"I see.\" Jansome looked at Thorn with an appraising eye. \"It is my pleasure to meet you, my Lord. I must admit I expected a Wolfkin, not a human, as Lord of the valley. Though, given that this is a human town, I guess it makes sense,\" Jansome quipped.\"Don't think of it as a human town. We are accepting of all races here. Plus,\" Thorn pointed to the side of the road where a few Wolfkin disciples were helping to dig a foundation for a new building, \"We'll be seeing an influx of Wolfkin before you know it. You are welcome to settle into the new shrine. If you need a place to stay, talk to Charles; he's the captain of the town guard.\"\"Thank you, but I'll be fine just staying in the shrine.\"Just then, Thorn saw another carriage coming into the town, so, pointing Jansome toward the newly built shrine, he got ready to greet the next arrival. And so the morning went with carriage after carriage bringing new villagers and supplies. Altogether the town gained a priest, two merchants, a blacksmith and a large number of settlers with their families, bringing the total population up to 323.About noon the wall surrounding the town was done, thanks to Thorn's ability to shift stones, and the new blacksmith started directing workers in building the gate while everyone else went to work on new houses for the incoming settlers. Between Thorn's muscle and the knowledge of the settlers, it wasn't long before the house frames were up and basic roofs were put on, ensuring that the settlers would at least stay dry for the first couple nights until they could get their walls built.Just as everyone was sitting down for their evening meal at the tavern, Akira bounded in, dashing up onto the table where Thorn was sitting and excitedly grabbing some bread off of his plate. \"Master! Guess what! Guess, guess!\" she chirped excitedly.\"You found them?\"\"Oh yes, yes! I found all of them, even though they were well hidden in the north. They hide in caves like moles! I call them mole people!\" declared Akira with glittering eyes. Sitting up proudly, she started stuffing the bread in her mouth.\"Good job!\" Hearing about the caves, Thorn's mind quickly revised his plan. It was one thing to approach an antagonistic group in an open area, quite another to try and deal with them in a fortified position. \"Tomorrow you'll have to show me where they are, okay?\"\"Mph.\" Clearing her throat Akira, looked at Thorn curiously. \"Why? The cave is dark and smelly. Only mole people live there. I don't want to go in.\"\"I need to meet with the... mole people.\" \"Oh, that's easy. They are on their way here.\"\"What?\" surprised, Thorn stood up quickly. \"How far away are they?\"\"Oh, I dunno. This bread is good!\" Having finished the last piece from Thorn's plate, Akira casually swiped another piece from the plate of the priest, completely ignoring his protests. \"A few of them were hiding in the bushes, and they saw you were rebuilding the town, so they ran to get their friends. I've never seen moles run so fast.\"Quickly explaining the situation to the others, who couldn't hear the mental communication between Thorn and Akira, Thorn gulped down his soup and then headed for the front gate. Keeping watch there, it wasn't long before he spotted a ragtag group of men coming out of the forest. Heavily armed and dangerous looking, they looked warily at Thorn, who stood in front of the new gate, leaning on his improvised mace.Each was armed with a bow, multiple blades and a short spear, while broken armor and ragged clothing completed their bandit look. Even from this distance, Thorn could see the mistrust radiating off of their bodies. Soon there were almost sixty of them arranged in a rough half circle facing him. From their midst, a large man stepped out, walking up until he was about twenty feet from Thorn. Dressed in a mostly complete set of chainmail and armed with a sword and shield, it was obvious from his bearing that he had once been an officer of some sort.\"Welcome to Greymane. What can we do for you?\" asked Thorn as the man got closer.\"Depends. Who are you?\" replied the man warily, staring at the giant in front of him. The others, equally nervous, scanned the wall for an ambush.\"Isn't it custom to introduce yourself first?\"\"Not when you are outnumbered 60 to 1,\" scoffed the bandit leader.Thorn was surprised that, despite facing so many armed men, he felt no fear at all. Instead, a faint excitement was starting to build in him as he stared at them. A faint hunger, as if they were a banquet waiting for him to feast. The bandit leader noticed this as he met Thorn's gaze and inadvertently took a small step back.\"I am Horvir Brightblade, leader of the Freemen,\" stated the bandit leader gravely, watching Thorn carefully for any sign of aggression.\"Well met, Horvir. I am Thorn, Lord Greymane, the Moon Wolf. I am the current ruler of these lands.\"Hearing this, the group of men gave sharp gasps, and their hands tightened on their weapons. Having been driven into their current state by the last Lord Greymane, they had little love for the bearer of the title. Angry murmurs grew as the hard-eyed men began to ready their weapons. Waving his hand to keep them from doing anything rash, Horvir took a long look at the new lord.\"The Freemen have claimed the forest and mountains in the north of the valley. So long as you leave us alone, we will not contest your claim as Lord Greymane. Otherwise you will find us a hard bone to chew.\"\"No.\" Still smiling slightly, Thorn took a small step forward. \"I am the ruler of the forest and surrounding mountains and will not allow any challenges to my authority. You are free to become my subjects or leave, but I will tell you now that there are no other paths for you.\"At this, the murmurs grew into shouts as the motley collection of men grew angry with his ultimatum. The sound of ringing steel grew as swords were pulled from sheathes and arrows nocked on bows. Concerned that the situation was about to turn into a bloodbath, Horvir wracked his brain for a way to stop the confrontation. Just as it looked like the bandits were about to charge, a figure hurried out of the gate, holding up something and yelling for everyone to wait. Reaching Thorn completely out of breath, Jansome, the priest of Hati, gulped in air and shouted for everyone to stand down. \"Brothers, there is no need for violence,\" he said, waving his staff aloft. Mounted to the top was a small banner showing a wolf chasing a crescent moon. \"Hati has once again blessed a shrine here in the village, and upon this holy ground I humbly request that both sides come to talk this out. Surely as brothers of the wolf we can reach an agreement for the good of the pack.\"Hearing his words, the bandits looked at each other in astonishment. Hati was back? Didn't this mean that the taint of the werewolves was gone? The Moon Wolf would surely not grace a village corrupted by tainted blood, would he? Slowly lowering their weapons, they looked to Horvir for his judgement.Walking forward to get a better look at the priest, Horvir's eyes widened. \"Jansome?! You lived through the hunt?\"\"It's good to see you too, brother.\" Smiling, the priest embraced the stunned bandit leader. \"It was a close thing, but Hati didn't let me fall. Come, come. Things have changed in the valley, and I believe it is worth talking to our new lord.\" Pulling Horvir along by the arm, Jansome brought him into the village.Soon Thorn, Jansome, Horvir and a few of the other bandits were seated in the inn around a table. Horvir and three other men had been allowed into the village, and the others had been left outside the gate where Akira was keeping an eye on them. Taking a deep breath, Jansome began to explain to Thorn what was going on. \"My Lord, Horvir is my half brother.\" Jansome's face blossomed into a smile, his gaze fixed on the still incredulous bandit leader. \"Horvir used to be one of the captains for the previous lord. However, after he was corrupted, the lord instituted a hunt to drive out and kill all the followers of Hati in the valley. Refusing to go along with it, Horvir was added to the hunt and ended up fleeing with a few of the other guards. I was the priest of the village at the time and barely escaped with my life. Since then, I lived in hiding outside the valley, hoping to one day return.\"A week ago, Hati visited me in a dream, telling me to come back to the valley to resume my work at the shrine here in Greymane Village. It is with great excitement that I have come to serve again. Horvir, I know you have fought for the people's freedom for the last ten years, but I believe it is time to let that fight go. Our new lord has cleansed the curse from Greymane Castle and is doing much to restore the village to the way it was before the curse took hold. Please listen to what the lord has to say,\" entreated Jansome, before turning back to address Thorn. \"Lord Greymane, please understand that my brother has been fighting and hiding for a long time now and is naturally distrustful. I know he has a good heart and is worried about the people under him, so I beg you would be gracious.\"\"I understand.\" Thorn took a good look at those in the room. Not long ago, they had no idea he even existed, and now he had simply swept in and seized the power they had been fighting over for the last ten years. It was no wonder that they were not on board with him being their ruler. \"Horvir, can I assume you speak for all the Freemen and their families?\"Horvir looked at the three men who had come with him and, seeing their nods, he said, \"I represent the Freemen and have been given the rights to negotiate for them.\"\"Excellent. Then let me lay out my case for you, and you can decide what you want to do. A few days ago, I came to this valley with the express purpose of slaying the werewolf who was the last Lord Greymane. Having done so, I assumed the position of Lord Greymane by force and merit.\" Here Thorn held up the Wolf Lord's ring for them to see. \"As the Greymane, I rule the Fang Forest, the Twins and Greymane village. \"All of the valley and the surrounding mountains are my domain. I intend to rule them justly, but I will rule them. I am working to improve Greymane Village into a town, and I intend to rebuild the Temple of the Moon, as well. I intend to open the valley to all those who would live peacefully here, and I will protect all that choose to do so. I will not, however, tolerate anyone who attempts to undermine my rule, no matter their claim.\"\"Hold on!\" interrupted one of the men who had come with Horvir, standing and slamming his helmet on the table. \"First, I want to know how you took care of the last lord, and how we know this isn't some sort of trick!\"Looking calmly at the rough man, Thorn reached out and grabbed the metal helmet that the man had slammed into the table and, without a smidgen of effort, crushed it into a ball. Stumbling back over his chair, the man's face blanched white, and everyone in the room broke out into a cold sweat, seeing the iron ball in Thorn's hands.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**If you've enjoyed what you read and are interested in reading more, please consider supporting me on www.patreon.com/SethRing where you can read all of Book #2 and advanced chapters from Book #3. Come explore the world of Nova Terra and help me determine where the story goes.You can find out more about me at www.sethring.com", "\"Look. The main point is this,\" Thorn's tone was even as he tossed the crushed helmet onto the table, \"I could really use some help in improving the valley, and knowledgeable woodsmen would go a long way toward keeping people safe. I don't have a problem with the Freemen so long as you work under me and not against me.\"Still staring at the ball of crushed metal, Horvir stammered, \"Yeah, of course.\"\"This is why I don't like intimidation,\" sighed Thorn. \"How about this. You have, what, 120 family members back in your caves? And another 100 fighting men?\"\"H..ho..how'd you know that?\" burst out the man who's helmet Thorn had crushed.\"Used my brain.\" Thorn did not mention Akira's nose. \"I'm guessing your food situation isn't so great and, come winter, it will be even worse. Why don't you move your families into the village? For any of you that want to, I'd like to employ you as rangers, patrolling the valley and keeping people safe. You'd be semi-autonomous, inside the command structure of my army, but tasked with keeping the roads safe, preventing banditry, and generally keeping the peace outside of town.\" \"Inside town, we'll be forming a guard. It will act as another part of the army we are establishing at the new temple to defend against any major threats from outside the valley. Both the guard and the rangers will be under the command of the army and may be deployed in the event of any major battles. The guard and the rangers will also be responsible for hunting down any remaining werewolves and killing them to make sure they never come back.\"\"I'll pay two silver a month plus a stipend for housing and food, and you'll get free gear repairs so long as you are a ranger. Anyone over the age of 50 who has been a ranger for two years or more can retire with a pension of one silver a month so long as they agree to help train new recruits.\"Silence settled over the room as the men thought about what Thorn was offering. Protection for their families, steady income and a place in the new society that Thorn was establishing sounded really good. Especially the idea of being able to retire on a pension. A couple of the members of their group were already getting up there in years and would undoubtedly welcome the chance to settle down after two years of service.Seeing they were seriously considering it, Thorn decided to give them one more little push. Tapping his chin like he was thinking out loud, he remarked, \"Actually, it would be really nice to have a group with some autonomy around. This would help reassure people that I am being held accountable. I'm planning on forming a council to help manage the valley when I am not around, and I could include a seat on it for the elected leader of the Freemen. This way you'll know what is going on and can watch for any signs of corruption. Anyway, think about it, I've got to check to make sure everyone is settled for the night. The four of you can feel free to spend the night here, but your men will have to camp outside.\"Leaving the men to talk over what he offered them, Thorn walked out of the inn and made his way to the shrine. Jansome had settled in quite quickly, adding some decorations to the otherwise simple affair. A low stone altar sat in front of the new banner bearing the wolf over moon emblem of Hati. Thorn had never been one for religion, but he knew that in old norse mythology Hati was one of the sons of Fenrir, the wolf god. Supposedly, Hati and his brother Skoll chased the moon and sun through the sky, attempting to devour them. Never able to catch up, they would continue to chase until Ragnarok, the end of the world, when they would finally be successful in eating the heavenly bodies. Obviously, Nova Terra was not using an exact match to real-world mythology, but many things seemed to carry over.All the families that had shown up over the last couple days were under shelter, and everything seemed to be settled down for the night, so Thorn called Akira over and went to bed. The next morning, he walked out to the street after breakfast and was startled to see the group of 60 bandits standing at attention in the street, obviously waiting for him.\"Present!\" yelled Horvir, stepping to the front of the group. As one, the group took a knee and, placing their weapons across their hearts, shouted together, \"We pledge our lives to our Lord, our hearts to our people and our swords to the throats of our enemies!\"For a moment, Thorn didn't know what to do, but a mental nudge from Akira snapped him out of his daze. Clearing his throat, he stood tall and responded, \"As your Lord, I accept your pledge and make my own. My heart will be for our people, my blood will be for our land. You will be my fang and I will be your shield. You knelt as outlaws, rise as Freemen of Greymane.\"Cheers erupted from all around as the villagers celebrated the return of those who had been cast out so long ago. Tearful hugs were exchanged, and Thorn commanded a keg broken open to toast the new rangers. Yet there was much to be done, and it wasn't long before 15 of the new rangers were headed back to get their families while the rest of the rangers helped around town. By evening all the houses were largely complete, and Elder Thomas had been spotted leading a caravan of new settlers down into the valley. Before the sun had gone down, the new settlers arrived at the gates, and after greeting them, Thorn decided that it was time to head to the location of the new temple to meet up with Velin, Mina, and the Wolfkin. Elder Thomas and Charles had both been really happy with the state of the town and were excited to see that the Freemen had agreed to join them again. The captain had hired a good number of older mercenaries to act as the town guard, and along with their families and the other settlers, the total population of Greymane Village grew to over 900 people.Making his way back to the keep took a little longer than usual due to the encroaching darkness, but unlike a week ago, the coming night did not seem sinister at all. Prior to the curse being broken, a darkness had hung over the valley, muting the life that lived here and bringing a chilling fear into the air. Having been banished by Thorn, the oppressive darkness was gone and a peaceful air reigned, making the Fang Forest feel like any other old growth wood.Strolling along, Thorn listened as Akira chatted about her kingdom and how many trees it contained. She continued to mark the trees they passed, jumping from branch to branch. It wasn't until she paused to mark a particularly tall tree that Thorn noticed the stillness that had fallen over the forest. During one of the incredibly short pauses that Akira took in her stream of conversation, Thorn suddenly realized that the regular night sounds had completely ceased. Not even the insects were making noise anymore, a good indication that something very dangerous was near. Letting Akira continue to chat, Thorn carefully looked around, trying to see if there was anything out of place. Just as he was sure that there was no one nearby, two yellow eyes appeared from the shadows in front of him, and the form of a massive wolf stepped out into the moonlight. Covered in knotted muscle and with too many scars to count, the pitch black wolf looked like it came straight out of a nightmare. An aura of monstrous strength radiated from its massive frame, and a crimson tongue ran across giant fangs.Eyes narrowing, Thorn took out his mace, holding it in a two handed grip and letting the large end rest on the ground to his right while Akira shrieked and jumped to the branches of a large tree. Silence fell as man and beast stared at each other, each seeking the weaknesses in the other's form. As far as Thorn was concerned, the monster in front of him had none. With a back as high as Thorn's shoulders and a head that, fully raised, would dwarf him by feet, the wolf was impossibly huge, and its tightly packed muscles and myriad scars were testament to its battle experience.\"Hmmm, you are the new Lord?\" rumbled the wolf in a deep voice. \"You smell strange. Like a weak blooded human and yet... There is something else. You will not do.\"\"Step forward, and you'll see if I'm weak,\" Thorn spat back. Ever since his trial by combat with the former head disciple, Gelish, Thorn felt an odd burning desire in his heart every time he thought about fighting. No matter how large the enemy, Thorn was confident in his strength.\"Ha, watch your words, whelp. You are lucky that my master told me to give you a chance to flee. If I attacked, you would never even see me coming. Weak senses, weak blood, weak abilities, you are not fit to be the Wolf Lord. Hand over the ring and flee this valley if you don't want to be hunted and killed like the prey you are.\" The massive wolf began to circle.\"Master?\" Brows furrowed Thorn turned his body to face the prowling beast. \"Who is your master?\" \"My master is the true ruler of this valley. Enough. Leave the ring and flee before my patience wears out. Otherwise I will destroy you where you stand and leave your body for the forest animals to feast on.\" 'Listen, you stupid dog! My master is a hun... a million times better than yours!' Akira cut in from her branch where she was jumping up and down in anger. 'You're just a smelly, mangy dog, and you probably have fleas!'Gaping at the exploding red furball in utter astonishment, Thorn was too shocked to move at the battle pet's sudden outburst. Akira, on the other hand, was quite pleased with her effect and continued to throw insults and rude gestures toward the wolf, who could only hear a loud burst of squeaks coming from the aliurade, who was jumping up and down on a branch. Suddenly, the absurdity of the situation hit Thorn, and he burst out laughing, drawing an angry snarl from the wolf.\"You know where to find me if your master really wants the ring,\" Thorn said, wiping his eyes and grinning at the furious monster. \"Unless you are going to try and get it now, I've got places to be. Come on Akira, lets go.\"\"Insolence!\" growled the wolf, fury in its eyes. Dropping into a crouch, it suddenly sprang, teeth and claws glistening in the moonlight! Thorn, however, was expecting it and had never relaxed his grip on his weapon. Seeing the wolf leap, Thorn dropped his hips, bending his knees and winding up. A quick step forward with his left foot brought him closer to the slavering jaws of the wolf and, with a twist of his waist, he brought his mace up in a wicked arc from the ground to his left shoulder.Reacting faster than should have been possible, the wolf somehow twisted its body in the air, avoiding being hit by the massive spike. Yet, despite its agility, it could not avoid the concussive burst of air that accompanied the swing, and it was thrown to the ground, lunging out of the way of Thorn's reverse swing.Scrambling to its feet, the wolf jumped back quickly. Unadulterated astonishment blazed in its eyes as it stared at Thorn. If either of the blows just now had connected, there was no way it would have gotten away without serious injury. Seeing Thorn rushing forward for another strike, the beast jumped forward and swung a massive paw. With a thunderous crash the two blows collided, the immense force sending both Thorn and the giant wolf reeling. Falling back, it took Thorn four steps to stabilize himself. Astounded by the force of the wolf's paw, Thorn dashed forward again as soon as he had his balance back. Ducking a slash, Thorn jabbed out with his weapon, forcing the wolf to twist its waist to dodge. Back and forth they struggled, ripping the ground to shreds. Blocking a bite with the haft of his  metal tetsubo, Thorn roared, punching out with a rock hard fist. The punch caught the wolf on the cheekbone, glancing off its iron-hard fur and sending it staggering backwards. His fury rising like a tide, Thorn gripped his long metal spike in two hands and raised it over his head, bringing it down with enough force to pulverize stone.Sensing the power behind the strike, the wolf jumped back, moving impossibly fast. It gave a strange growl, melting into the shadows of the trees until all that was left were its yellow eyes. \"Interesting. You surprise me human,\" snarled the wolf as it faded away. \"I'll visit again.\"\"Haha, that's right! You better run! Master, we scared him off because he is just a huge scaredy cat!\" yipped Akira, jumping back down onto Thorn's shoulder. Sighing, he looked at the shadows where the monster had gone. Thinking back over the fight, Thorn could only shake his head. Even though it looked like he had the wolf at a disadvantage, Thorn knew better. If the wolf had stayed to fight, there was no way he would have gotten off without injury, and he might have even died.Not only had the wolf's awareness been way above his, but, despite being knocked back by the force of his blows, it had no problem avoiding his strikes when it chose to. If he couldn't hit the wolf, he would have no way of winning. After careful examination of the fight, Thorn couldn't shake the feeling that this had been nothing more than a test and that, if the wolf was serious, it could have just slaughtered him where he stood.And to think that behind the monstrous wolf was another, most likely stronger, being. Its 'master'. Thorn had taken what he had from the hands of werewolves and had decided to try and hold what he had seized, no matter who came at him.They would come, he knew that for sure. Without a doubt, the next few weeks would find people flowing into this valley in droves, looking for their hearts' desires, taking what they could. Thorn had taken a pledge today to help those who lived here already prosper, and he intended to see it through to the end, no matter how much blood, sweat, or tears it took.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**If you've enjoyed what you read and are interested in reading more, please consider supporting me at www.patreon.com/SethRing where you can read all of Book #2 and advanced chapters from Book #3.

It had regained some of the palpable gloom that had shrouded it the first time Thorn had seen it. The crunching gravel under Thorn's feet echoed loudly in the now silent courtyard. Even Akira, normally chatty, had fallen silent.Climbing the stairs to the throne room, Thorn ran his fingers along the uneven stone walls. Soon this derelict castle would join the old ruler of the valley, relegated to history. Thinking about it made Thorn wonder if someday he too would be overtaken, if the temple he was about to build would fall into disrepair, its original architect forgotten.Shaking the depressing thoughts from his head, Thorn approached the throne, activating the familiar relocation option. Last time, his hesitancy came from the time limit on the [Control Orb], but after handling both the bandits and Greymane Village, he was confident that he would be able to finish everything he needed to in time.A bright yellow glow lit the room as soon as Thorn clicked the button, and a glass orb appeared, hovering over the Wolf Throne. Like molten gold, rays of light poured over the back of the chair, melting it away as they fell. Once the throne had disappeared entirely, the rays shot back up to the glass orb, filling it with swirling golden light. Floating gently through the air, the orb stopped in front of Thorn, allowing him to grab it. Stuffing the orb into his inventory, Thorn took one last look around the keep before leaving through the front gate. Taking in a deep breath of the crisp night air, Thorn called Akira and began to run toward the entrance to the valley. Passing quickly under the massive trees of the old growth forest, it did not take long before the Twins came into sight. The entrance to the valley was dominated by two tall peaks, referred to locally as the Twins because of their symmetrical shape. With the pass between them being the only entrance into the valley, the Twins were a perfect natural defensive line due to their height. Thorn planned to place the temple squarely in the center of the pass, blocking the valley off from the outside world. The map that Mina had compiled showed the valley to be rich in resources. Combined with the fact that the valley was going to be opening up as a spawn point for players choosing to play as Wolfkin, Thorn had been thinking a lot about how to leverage his position as Lord Greymane. Less concerned about the monetary benefits of controlling a territory, Thorn had a different idea in mind, and the first step was creating a place for his influence to grow. Practically flying across the forest floor, Thorn soon made it to the foot of the Twins. Another ten minutes, and he was standing in the pass. Campfires burned low, and the soft breathing of the sleeping Wolfkin sounded clearly in the silent night. A sentry at the edge of the Wolfkin camp had nearly swallowed his tongue when Thorn rushed up the hill, but after patting him on the back and forbidding him from announcing Thorn's arrival, Thorn headed to the main tent.The camp had been set up around a large central tent. Seeing a light still glowing from a crack in the tent's door, he pushed aside the flap and ducked his head as he entered. Leaning over a large map of the area, Velin was occupied in a low-voiced conversation with Captain Del'har. Hearing the swish of the flap, they looked up, stopping their conversation to salute.\"How many times have I told you not to do that?\"\"Sorry, my lord. Old habits die hard.\" The captain rose from where he had kneeled.\"And what is your excuse?\" Thorn shot a glance at Velin before turning his attention to the map they had been studying.\"It seems the correct thing to do.\" Velin was serious, straightening from her half bow. Silence fell on the tent as Thorn stared at the map. As the atmosphere got increasingly stifling, Thorn sighed and shook his head.\"Velin, I'm sorry.\" Seeing that she was about to respond, Thorn held up his hand. \"No, I am. I should not have snapped at you the other day. It is obvious that I am not as over what happened as I thought. Your suggestion was reasonable, but for whatever reason, I took it badly. I know that it wasn't fair for me to shut you down like that. I'm sorry, and I will try to do a better job in the future.\"\"Thank you, Thorn.\" Velin's normally cold face broke into a small smile as she looked down, adjusting her hair behind her ear. After a moment of warm silence, she returned back to her business-like attitude, obviously uncomfortable with such personal conversation. \"Once it was clear that you are determined to control the valley, I started planning. Take a look, and let me know what you think.\"Turning his attention back to the map, Thorn listened carefully as Velin outlined the situation. Crimson Snake scouts had been spotted less than a day's march from the valley, which meant that the army was going to arrive slightly ahead of schedule. Assuming that the army was less than a day's march behind the scouts, the invasion was eminent. \"Our ability to defend the valley will rely on a few things. First, we'll have to be able to defend it physically. What I mean is that we are going to have to win the battle. The invading force is almost five times our number. They have as many player soldiers as we have native soldiers. Normally, this sort of battle would be unwinnable. Our only option is fortifications if we want to put up a fight. Thorn, I'm not sure what you have in mind yet, so I have not planned a defensive strategy.\"Assuming we can stop the army outside the valley, we're going to have to face the second issue. We don't actually have a way to make them leave. This is a game, so the players can just respawn, which puts us in a bind. There is nothing to stop the Crimson Snakes from camping on our doorstep until they wear us out. My only idea is to put pressure on Angdrin from inside Ragnarok, but to do that, we would have to give up some control.\" Pausing, she looked at Thorn. \"Both of these things are out of my hands. I'm afraid I'm not going to be much help in terms of planning.\"\"No problem.\" Thorn's gaze rested on the map as he considered the two problems Velin had outlined. \"I'm working on the second problem as we speak. For now, let's focus on dealing with the fight we have coming. I've got a plan drawn up for the temple that should help with our defense. It ended up going sort of a fortress monastery style. Big walls and that sort of thing which should allow us to minimize our disadvantage.\" Opening his interface, Thorn sent the design of the new temple to Velin and Captain Del'har. \"I've never fought a war before, so I don't know if we need to make any modifications. Take a look, and let me know what you think.\"\"This...\" After looking over the design Velin was lost for words. She had expected a sketch and had instead gotten full architectural blueprints showing elegant buildings behind a towering wall. \"Where did you get this?\"\"Ah. I drew it a few years ago. Went through a castle phase and had a lot of time on my hands. Like, excessive amounts of time. This design is based on Punakha Dzong, a fortress in Bhutan. I thought it looked the most temple-like, but it is also easy to defend. Though, this is a bit bigger because of the width of the pass. Anything jump out at you that wouldn't work?\"\"No, my lord, this looks quite impressive.\" Captain Del'har shook his head. Seeing that Velin was still speechless, Thorn nodded and stepped outside the tent. Knowing that Thorn was going to be building the temple in the pass, the Wolfkin had made camp a ways away from the entrance. After making sure the area was clear, Thorn opened the store and uploaded his blueprints.A few adjustments had to be made to allow the temple to fit in the space properly, but within less than half an hour, the order was ready to go. Giving everything a once over to make sure he was not missing any of the details, Thorn smiled and hit the accept order button.\"Behold, the Temple of the Moon!\"*bzzt* Blushing with embarrassment as Captain Del'har and Velin stared at the empty pass, Thorn quickly called his aunt.\"Xavier! How are you? Are you having fun?\"\"Hi.\" Still bright red, Thorn got straight to the point. \"Can you raise my spending cap on my account? I'm trying to build a building, but the system says I can't because my spending is capped.\"\"Oh? Your limit is five million. What on earth would you spend more than five million on?\"Rather than trying to explain everything from the beginning, Thorn just sent his aunt the blueprints and shared his vision through the call. \"Remember that valley I told you about? Well, its mine and I'd like to keep it. I'm going to build a big fortress here to block the only way in.\" Thorn pointed to the entrance to the pass. \"However, the cost is pretty serious. Sixty million.\"\"Sixty million credits?! Are you crazy?\" Julia's eyebrows shot up when she heard the price. \"What on earth could make it cost so much?\"\"Well, I'm trying to make it both a temple and a fortress, so it is a bit bigger than most castles. And there are two sub levels that can be used as extra barracks or storage, plus a mini shopping district. And some towers for ballista. And I might have added three heavy duty gates. And a giant wolf head on top of the fortress with a waterfall coming out of its mouth. Oh, and I made the walls taller.\"\"Xavier, the base price for a system built castle is twenty million. Twenty five, tops. There is no way that stuff cost forty million credits.\"\"Well, this is more of a town than a castle.\"\"A town?!\"\"Yeah. After all, people are going to need places to stay, right? So I added a pretty large hotel, and there are storefronts for people to rent. And I saw that I could add all sorts of different production facilities, so I did. This way, as our guild adds players with production classes, we'll be set up already. Ah, and I bought a bunch of resources, too. That was at least three million.\"\"You built a town? You better be mining gold out of that valley if you want to make sixty million credits back.\" \"Gold? Haha, I have something better. A race. The Wolfkin spawn here, and their racial advancement quests are tied to the valley, as well. So, anyone who wants to play a Wolfkin is going to be spending time here. There is also at least one ancient ruin in the mountains behind the valley, probably more than that. According to Velin, any time there is a new race, there is a large influx of new players or people buying race changes. \"Even if it is not a popular race, we can expect at least a million players. If each of them spends sixty credits in the valley, our cost will be pretty much covered. To say nothing of the merchants that will come in to serve the new players. Add the other natural resources the valley has to that, and whoever controls this valley will be making bank. I intend for that to be us.\"\"And here I thought that you were just playing around.\" At the prospect of making money, Julia's eyes lit up. \"I've adjusted your spending cap, you shouldn't have any problem. You're doing great, hun; I'll see you soon, okay?\"\"Thanks! Love you.\" Closing the call, Thorn turned back to the empty pass and tried again. As he hit the button to accept the order, the world shimmered, as if a wave of heat passed through the air. As the world stabilized, a familiar figure appeared.\"Greetings, traveler.\"\"Hello, Myst.\" Thorn smiled at the beauty in her shimmering blue dress. \"My system indicates that you have made a large purchase. I am here to ensure satisfaction. Please indicate that the details here are correct. If they are correct, please initial at the six highlighted locations, and sign on the last page.\"\"Thanks, what is the time frame on the build?\" Thorn asked after flipping through the document on the pad Myst handed him.\"That is a great question, traveler. The time frame on the construction of your ordered building is forty-seven minutes and thirty-six seconds from the project's commencement.\" Accepting the pad back from Thorn, Myst tapped it a few times. \"Thank you for finalizing your purchase. Would you like to give a name to your project?\"\"Yeah. Let's call it Moon Wolf Citadel.\"\"Thank you, traveler. Your project is commencing, please standby until it completes.\" With one last smile, Myst turned and walked into thin air, disappearing just as fast as she had appeared.The air in the pass shivered again and froze. Curious, Thorn reached out, only to feel a smooth, invisible wall blocking his hand. In the center of the pass, a large blue box appeared with a large white zero on it.[0%]", "The new temple was laid out in a large rectangle, built to stretch from one side of the pass to the other. Walking with his hand on the clear wall, Thorn found that it stretched the whole distance. Dropping his hand, he returned to stand with Velin and the Captain, watching as a greyish blue fog rose from the ground, filling the space where the temple would be built. Suddenly, dirt fountained from inside the layer of fog, jetting up into the air, where it disappeared. [1%]After thirty seconds, the large number in the center of the wall climbed from zero to one. Shortly after, large stone blocks began to fall from the sky, vanishing into the roiling cloud. As time went on, other materials like timber, brick, and metal would appear and drop into the fog. Every thirty seconds, the number would tick up, and the fog obscuring their view would climb.As they stood watching, Thorn looked around.\"Where is Mina?\"\"She logged out.\"\"Is she mad at me?\"\"Most likely. Please excuse her immaturity, she can be quite emotional, and I think she is fairly sensitive right now.\"\"It is no problem. Would it be helpful if I sent her a message?\"\"No.\" Sighing, Velin tucked her hair behind her ear. \"I think she needs time to think things through. Life has been moving fast since we climbed the tower with Ouroboros, and she probably just needs a bit of space to sort through the changes. Our relationship is not quite the same as it was, or as Mina hopes for it to be, and that is causing her some distress.\"\"Alright.\" Thorn nodded. \"Let me know if there is anything I can do.\"\"Thank you.\"After watching the gradually appearing temple in silence for a moment, Thorn changed the subject.\"I guess I don't actually know much about you and Mina. You live together, right? Have you lived together long?\"\"That is true, I guess we've never really talked about ourselves.\" The corners of Velin's lips curled slightly, her small smile lighting up her face. \"Mina and I have been friends for a long time. Since elementary school, actually. We were roommates in college, as well.\"\"Wait, that means you're in your twenties?\" Asked Thorn, not bothering to conceal his shock.\"Yes. I'm twenty-five, Mina is twenty-four. How old did you think we were?\"\"I mean, I would have guessed around that for you, but I definitely thought Mina was sixteen.\"\"Haha, that is sort of understandable. Most people take her to be younger because of her height. How old are you?\"\"Uh. Sixteen.\"\"No way.\" Velin smirked. Seeing Thorn's serious gaze, her smile faltered. \"No way. You are sixteen? How...?\" Trailing off, Velin held up her hand, as if she could measure Thorn's height.\"How am I so tall?\" Thorn chuckled. \"I grew fast. Thankfully, I've stopped growing.\" Seeing that Velin was distracted by his revelation, Thorn prompted her. \"You were saying that you and Mina knew each other in college?\"\"Hm, yes. That is right. We lived together in college. When we got out, we joined Ragnarok. That was about two years ago. Since we were already good friends, we got an apartment together. Since then we've been playing Nova Terra and trying to help Ouroboros grow his influence.\"\"What did you study in school that got you a job with a guild?\"\"I studied to be an information engineer. I was pretty lucky that I was hired as an analyst almost right away. Mina studied communications, but spent most of her time playing Nova Terra. She was hired as a combatant.\" Seeing Thorn's eyebrows rise, Velin defended her friend. \"Don't be fooled, Mina is an excellent player. She has great timing and her skill set is really good in group fights. Just wait until Ragnarok gets here. She earned her Ice Witch class by her own hard work.\"\"Alright, I'll pay attention. Both of you are great players, have you ever considered joining the Society of Roses?\"\"Considered? What use would that be? They don't accept new members. And even if they did, the application list would be at least twenty miles long.\"\"Oh yeah? Are they pretty popular?\"\"Popular is an understatement.\" Velin pulled out her notebook and flipped to an empty page. \"They are the most well known group in the game. It doesn't hurt that the Queen of Roses is rich and powerful in real life, either.\"\"Queen of Roses?\"\"Ah, I forget how much you don't know. The Queen of Roses is Athena, the leader of the Society of Roses guild. Her real name is Julia Lee. She is the CEO of Atlas.\" As Velin finished speaking, her eyes went wide, and she shot a glance at Thorn, who was watching the glowing number counting up. With some effort, she kept her voice from quivering. \"She is strong, pretty, and rich. The envy of pretty much everyone in Nova Terra.\"\"I can imagine.\" Thorn rubbed the bridge of his nose as he diverted the topic. \"Looks like the temple is just about done. Let's check it out.*ding*[100%]As the glowing numbers reached one hundred, the invisible wall dissipated, and the blue fog rolled back, revealing Moon Wolf Citadel in all its glory. A tall stone wall towered above Thorn's head, easily reaching twenty-five feet high. Four tall towers stood at the corners of the walls, providing an excellent field of view of both sides of the pass. Lit in a soft, blue glow by magical ever-burning torches, the citadel looked like something out of a fairytale.The fortress itself sat in the center of the citadel, aligned with the two large metal-studded wooden gates that controlled the entrance and exit of the Moon Wolf Citadel. Stone walls radiated out from the fortress like the spokes of a wheel, dividing the citadel into six sections. Two walls ran from the fortress to the sides of the gatehouses, forming a funnel leading from the gate to a tunnel running underneath the fortress.To the sides of the fortress were the various areas that Thorn had built in preparation for the influx of players who would be arriving in the valley. Apart from the pathway leading through the citadel, the rest of the space was divided into four distinct districts. On the right side of the main gate was the merchant square, packed with empty shops and open areas for trade. Based on what he had observed in Berum, Thorn expected that most players would be spending their time in this area.  On the other side of the entrance, Thorn had placed the residential and training districts. While there, players would be able to arrange housing, visit inns, or get training in a variety of different basic skills. Purchasing a training hall had added quite a bit of cost to the citadel's price, but the fees Thorn would be able to collect from it made it an easy choice. Unlike the merchant area, Thorn had also left about half of the space in this section of the citadel empty to allow for future buildings to go in.Behind the merchant area were the production buildings that Thorn had purchased. Much like the training hall, their cost had been high, but Thorn felt that the expense was necessary in order to create a solid base for his guild. This area also had a number of residences that could be used by members of the guild and natives who settled into the Moon Wolf Citadel.The last section of the citadel was the reconstructed temple. The area the temple took up was bigger than Greymane Keep and connected directly with the fortress in the center of the citadel. It had been expanded to include quarters for the disciples in training as well as four sectors for the different courts. Additionally, the temple was connected to a subterranean area containing a barracks and extra storage. Connected with tunnels to various sections of the city wall, the subterranean levels allowed for quick access to every part of the city.Towering over the center of the pass, the fortress was an imposing affair. Sitting squarely in between the two tall peaks, it almost looked like a new mountain had been added. The fortress sat over a large tunnel that connected the front and back gates. Thorn had made sure that the tunnel was big enough to move two wagons through side by side, but had also added six metal portcullises for a measure of defense. The inside of the fortress had the typical great room and ballroom, while the rest of the fortress was split up between the kitchen, a number of offices, bedrooms, storage rooms, and even a wizard's tower.After a quick tour of the citadel, the first thing Thorn did was head to the great room of the fortress. Taking out the [Control Orb] from his inventory, Thorn activated it, choosing to place the control point where the throne would go. With a flash of bright light, the process that Thorn had witnessed in the Keep reversed. Seeing the [Control Orb] melting and reforming the Wolf Throne, Thorn had a hard time keeping a grin off his face. As he stood watching the throne being reconstructed, Thorn heard hurried footsteps behind him. Turning, he saw Velin and Mina both rushing in.\"Thorn, the scouts have arrived! We need to get the army together since the main force will not be far behind. Wow, look at that view!\" Distracted by the large balcony that ran the length of one side of the great room, Mina dashed outside, taking in the sight of the valley. Dark green forest stretched far into the distance, lying quietly under the twinkling stars. The soft breeze blew against Mina, causing her to grab her hat as she looked down. In the distance, the mountains cut against the sky, like jagged teeth under the bright moon.\"That is really pretty.\" Mina walked back inside and started examining the tapestries that covered the opposite wall. \"This place must have cost a fortune. Looks like we picked the right side this time. Ah, I mean...\" Choking on her words, Mina blushed and looked away, her voice trailing off.\"It was expensive, but I think it is worth it.\" Sitting on the newly reformed Wolf Throne, Thorn pretended he had not heard Mina's last sentence to spare her embarrassment. \"This will be our base of operations from now on. I was hoping to do this when Oberlin was back, but we don't really have a lot of time, so I'll just go ahead and announce the official formation of our guild.\" \"We're starting a guild?\" Mina looked at Velin and then Thorn, confusion written all over her face.\"Yes, I told you that, didn't I?\" Thorn scratched his head. A lot had happened recently, and as preoccupied as he was with planning the valley's defense, he had been quite distracted. \"Honestly, I can't remember. Anyway, we're starting a guild.\"\"Hey, that is awesome!\" Mina cheered. \"But there are only three of us so far. How are we supposed to get more people?\"\"We'll be recruiting mostly natives, actually. Wolfkin disciples who become Night Walkers.\" Seeing Mina's expression revert to confusion, Thorn sighed and held his forehead in his palm. \"Disciples from the Moon Temple become Night Walkers when they finish their training. Since we will be housing them, and I am sort of their boss already, Elder Havva has agreed to allow them to join our guild.\"\"Does this mean we will be getting players, as well?\" Velin asked, getting out her notebook to scribble some notes.\"Potentially. We have the right of refusal, obviously, but it is conceivable that any player who succeeds in joining the temple will be able to graduate into the Night Walkers, and therefore, into our guild.\"\"Oh wow, that is genius!\" Mina's eyes were wide with excitement as she smacked her fist into her palm. \"The Temple of the Moon is the primary way for new Wolfkin players to gain classes and advance, which means that they are going to be walking right into our guild. It is like one of those spout things with water that goes straight from one place to your house!\"\"A pipeline?\" Velin's face didn't even twitch as she explained for Thorn's benefit.\"Exactly, a pipeline.\"\"Correct. My goal was to find a way to build a reliable pipeline for recruiting new members. We are not going to be Wolfkin exclusive, obviously, but since we are already in control of this region, it makes sense to use that to our advantage. Plus, since we can recruit natives, why not do so in a way that consolidates our control of the region?\"\"So, what is our guild name going to be?\" Mina was obviously much more interested in the answer to this question than she was in Thorn's schemes to consolidate his power.\"Nova Luna.\"\"Nova Luna? That is pretty.\" Mina considered it for a few minutes, before nodding her head sagely.\"It means New Moon,\" Velin tossed in without looking up.\"New Moon, right.\" Mina pretended she had known that from the beginning.  \"I was thinking that we would keep it in line with our moon theme,\" Thorn said, trying to suppress a laugh. Opening his interface, Thorn clicked on his guild tab and activated it. Immediately after Thorn selected yes, the guild tab vanished, replaced by his [RMS], which had gained a new tab. Selecting it, Thorn made a mental note to spend some time figuring out what the countless options were used for as he scrolled down. Ignoring the questions asking him about how he wanted to set up the guild, Thorn found the spot for adding other players and sent invitations to Mina, Velin, and Oberlin.\"I've invited you to the guild. Alright, there we go.\" Seeing that Velin and Mina had accepted the invitation, Thorn set Velin as an administrator and gave her control of the guild settings. \"Velin, when you have some time, can you set everything up? I honestly have no idea what most of these options are, so I'm probably better suited for guarding the gate for now.\"\"Of course, it would be my pleasure. I'd be happy to show you how to do it, as well.\"\"Thanks, maybe later.\" Rising from the throne, Thorn summoned his silver wolf armor and drew his massive metal spike. \"Right now, it is time to go greet those scouts.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**If you've enjoyed what you read and are interested in reading more, please consider supporting me at www.patreon.com/SethRing where you can read all of Book #2 and advanced chapters from Book #3.

Velin had deployed a number of Wolfkin volunteers to be on the lookout for the advancing army, and Mina had gotten the report as soon as she had logged in. Rushing to the hill where the Crimson Snake scout had been seen, Thorn and Mina were greeted by a Wolfkin dressed in leather armor and holding a bow.\"Greetings, my lord,\" whispered the Wolfkin scout. \"Hello, Lady Mina.\"\"At ease,\" Thorn replied, his eyebrow rising as he heard the way the scout addressed the Ice Witch. \"Tell us the situation.\"\"Yes, sir. The advancing scouts are moving at about half speed. They are holding a semi-circular pattern to increase the range of their search. The scout I spotted stopped on this hill about five hours ago and returned to the other world.\"\"Hmmm. They probably logged out to sleep. That means we should have at least a few hours before they are back. Did all of the scouts log out?\" Checking his clock, Thorn realized that it was about midnight in the real world.\"It appears so, sir. We have been able to find tracks, but no enemy scouts.\"\"Excellent. Let's rotate south. Might as well use this opportunity to delay them.\" Bringing the Wolfkin Dusk Walker with them, the three rushed south, following the half circle path that the Crimson Snake scouts had occupied. Unsurprised by the Dusk Walker's ability to keep up with him, Thorn was a little taken aback when Mina refused his offer to carry her.Shaking her head resolutely, the Ice Witch had muttered something about being perfectly capable in her own right and then, in a flash of icy wind, teleported forward. Each teleportation could take her fifty meters forward, allowing her to outpace the two runners easily. Constantly casting the teleportation spell was obviously taxing, and Mina soon began to breathe heavily. \"Hey, Mina. Hold up,\" Thorn called for her to wait in between two teleports.\"What? Hey, what are you doing? Put me down!\" Lifted off the ground unexpectedly, Mina grabbed tightly onto Thorn's head as he set her on his shoulder.\"There is no need for you to waste your magic here. I need you fresh when we ambush the scouts.\"\"Hmph. Fine.\" Turning her head away, Mina lapsed into silence. Thorn could tell that she was still angry at him. Ever since she had logged in she had been much quieter than normal.The group of three ran through the forests, occasionally seeing a Wolfkin Dusk Walker who would rise from their hiding places to point the direction to the next location. Within half an hour, they had made it to the southern end of the Crimson Snake formation and met up with the Dusk Walker who was responsible for watching for the enemy.\"Let's wait here.\" After finding the spot where the scout had logged out, Thorn walked to a small copse of trees nearby. \"Plan is simple: when the scout logs back in, we'll attack. Once we take out the scout, we will retreat a bit and watch for more scouts.\"\"How are we going to ambush them from here?\" Mina asked, looking at the distance separating them from the tracks.\"Leave that to me.\" Grinning, Thorn pulled out his giant siege crossbow from his inventory. Resting the arbalest on his shoulder, Thorn made a shooting motion at the spot where the scout had logged out. \"As soon as they log in, bam! Though, I will need you to back me up if I miss.\" \"Sure thing, I got it.\" Mina patted her chest confidently. \"You know, I think we need a cool symbol for our guild. Like, something really distinctive.\"Used to Mina's abrupt subject changes, Thorn nodded, happy that she was getting back to her normal talkative self. He produced one of the silver tokens with the mark of Hati that he had gotten in Hati's Ascent, handing it over to her.\"What do you think about this? I am thinking of adapting the symbol of Hati. We're already really closely tied with the Moon Wolf and the Wolfkin, so using it shouldn't be an issue.\"\"I think it is a pretty cool symbol, though I think it'd be better to use the citadel instead of the wolf head. Same idea, but with the outline of the citadel. Or maybe the citadel with the wolf head on top of it.\" The longer she spoke, the brighter Mina's eyes got.\"Yeah, that is a pretty cool idea.\" Thorn nodded, his eyes fixed on the empty field where their target would appear.For the next five hours they waited for the scout to log back in. Thorn used much of that time to compose messages and plan for the impending war, all the while lending Mina's unceasing conversation half an ear. About half-way through the wait, Thorn's stomach began to rumble, interrupting Mina.\"Really? Didn't you just eat on the way over here?\" Mina rolled her eyes. \"You are ridiculous.\"\"Hey, there is a lot of me to maintain,\" Thorn protested, spreading a small blanket on the ground next to him. \"It is time for a snack.\" He began to pull steaming hot dishes from his inventory, setting them on the blanket in preparation for his snack. After the sixth dish, the two Night Walkers' jaws dropped open. However, their shock at the amount of food Thorn got out for his snack paled in comparison to the horror they felt as they watched him swallow whole plates of food in just a few bites.Not wanting to be left out, Mina jumped in with gusto, desperately grabbing food to shove in her mouth before Thorn sent it down his throat into the bottomless pit that was his stomach. When she practically choked on the food, Thorn  patted her on the back. \"Slow down. There is plenty.\" Turning to the astounded Night Walkers, Thorn gestured with the large turkey leg he was holding. \"Are you hungry? Please help yourself. Don't stand on ceremony either, I am not really into that.\"After the four of them ate their fill, and Thorn had cleaned up the plates, he picked up his arbalest again and aimed it loosely at the field. He was not completely sure where the scout would be spawning, but he was confident that his giant bolt would be enough to take them out. After another forty minutes of waiting, one of the Night Walkers noticed a slight shimmer in the air and called it out in a low voice.In the field a figure appeared as if they were stepping through a film of rolling mist. A young woman in the familiar crimson armor covered by a dark green cloak began to materialize. Looking around as she logged in, the female scout failed to notice Thorn and the others hiding in the nearby clump of trees. Just as her body broke through the last wisps of ether, a giant crossbow bolt as thick as her wrist smashed through her crimson chest plate, blasting her body into shattered lights. Just as quickly as the scout had arrived, she was sent out of the game. \"Alright, let's retrieve the bolt and anything she dropped and retreat. We need one person to stay here and let us know if the army is moving this direction.\"\"I'd be happy to do that, my lord.\" One of the Dusk Walkers stepped forward, his fist thumping on his chest in a warrior's salute.\"Make sure you keep your distance. Absolutely no engagement allowed. Hide somewhere nearby, and as soon as you spot the army, retreat to the Moon Wolf Citadel, and report to Velin. We'll need every possible fighter back at the pass, so prioritize safety over everything else.\"\"Yes, sir!\"\"Mina, I am going to head off the scout west of here and then retreat, you deal with the scout to the northeast.\" Thorn turned to the other Dusk Walker. \"I am trusting you to keep her safe and back her up in case there is more than one enemy.\"\"Of course, my lord!\" Giving a warrior's salute, the lanky Wolfkin gripped his bow tightly, his eyes shining with pride at Thorn's trust.\"Bah, I don't need help,\" Mina grumbled. \"I don't lose one on one fights, ever.\"\"Mina, don't mess around. This is serious. We are trying to buy as much time as possible, but if you go and get yourself killed, we will have serious problems later.\"\"Okay, okay. I get it. Man, you're starting to nag like Velin.\"\"Alright, let's go.\" Patting the short Ice Witch on the head, Thorn gave an encouraging smile to the two Wolfkin and the group split up, heading to their respective jobs.Thirteen miles northwest, a large group of people wound their way slowly through the underbrush like a giant crimson serpent. At the head of the group, Telis and Korith, Angdrin's two lieutenants, talked quietly together as they led the way. \"That's what I'm saying. I feel like we're grasping at straws,\" Korith grumbled in a low voice.\"Hush!\" His crimson armored companion looked around to see if anyone could hear. \"You know it is not going to end well if anyone hears you, so stop talking about it.\"\"Don't pretend you feel any different about it.\" The warrior spat on the ground. About to continue, he was stalled by Telis' raised hand. \"Hold on. I just got a message from Jace.\" Her eyes grew wide in excitement. \"She was killed almost as soon as she logged in. Southeast of here, ten to fifteen miles away. Send the two nearest scouts to check what is going on. We'll take a fifteen minute rest and then adjust our direction if needed.\"\"Hold march!\" Bellowed Korith, causing the winding column of players and natives to stop. \"We're taking a fifteen minute break, so eat your rations if you have them, but maintain march readiness!\" Turning back to Telis, who was still reading the message she had received from the scout, he frowned. \"What is going on? What did Jace find?\"\"Chill out. I'm still trying to make sense of this. She said that she spawned but, as soon as she did, she got hit by a giant spear and was killed.\"\"A giant spear?\"\"Yeah, the shaft was at least the size of her wrist.\"\"Whoa, that is big. Sounds like an ogre's spear. I really hope it isn't ogres,\" Korith groaned, rubbing his bald head. \"We'll find out soon. I've dispatched Ellie and Silverflare to that position, so we should have more information soon.\" The more even of the two, Telis re-read the message while getting some rations from her inventory.To the south, two scouts that had logged in nearby got a message and immediately changed their direction, heading toward the spot where their companion had been killed. Moving carefully, the male scout smoothed back his silver hair with both hands, revealing sharp, pointed ears. As an elf, he had a natural affinity for moving through nature and made good time getting to Jace's last known position.Studying the empty field from afar, a slight prickling along the back of his neck told him that there was something off. Thanks to his class, he could sense the danger in the air, though he could not pinpoint exactly where the danger was originating. Concerned, he was about to retreat when he heard a sound, and the temperature around him plummeted, reaching zero degrees in less than a second. Shocked, he tried to throw himself backwards, but his feet would not move. As an arrow cut a path through the back of his neck, his brain caught up to his ears.\"[Sub Zero].\"Watching as the elven scout vanished into sparkling lights, Mina stood up out of a bush and stomped her way to where the scout had fallen, grumbling under her breath the whole way. She was absolutely confident that she could have beaten the scout in a one on one fight, but Thorn obviously did not trust her, so he had sent a Wolfkin along to babysit. Kicking the grass aside, her mood brightened when she found a small hand crossbow that the dead scout had dropped. Hugging it to her chest, she waved to the Dusk Walker, and the two of them sped off.Back at the Crimson Snake camp, Telis was just putting the last of her rations in her mouth when she received two messages at the same time. Reading the first line, she choked, sending crumbs of bread, cheese, and dried meat all over Korith.\"Ugh, gross. What was that for?\" Wiping his face off, the large warrior stepped over to pat his partner on the back, only to have her dodge away and wave him off. Once she had gotten her coughing under control, she straightened, a dangerous look in her eyes that caused Korith to backup warily. \"On your feet, we move now!\" Telis yelled, enraged, causing the army to burst into action. Rations were finished or put away, and within two minutes the army was lined up neatly, ready to go.\"Hey, what is happening? What's wrong?\" Korith asked as Telis began to lead the way to the south.\"Silverflare and Ellie both died. They just sent me messages. It looks like someone doesn't want us going that direction.\"\"Are you serious? Both of them? What happened.\"\"Yes. Ellie said she died because she got hit by a tree? What? That is what the message says. A whole tree. As she was approaching the spot where Jace died, a tree suddenly jumped up in the air and smashed her.\"\"Uh. What?\"\"I have no idea. And frankly, from what the note says, neither does she.\"\"Then what has you so steamed?\"\"Before Silverflare died he was hit with [Sub Zero].\"\"You mean that spell that Mina uses? No way. Why would she be attacking us? She got kicked out of Ragnarok by Ouroboros. If she was going to be attacking someone, shouldn't it be the Blood Guard? Why would she be killing our scouts?\"\"Maybe she was never really kicked out? I have no idea. The point is, that witch is killing our scouts, and I'm going to beat her into a pulp,\" Telis fumed.\"Whoa, slow down. I know you don't like her, but remember why we're here.\"\"I know, I know. I won't let my personal issues with her get in the way. My main concern is that Ouroboros dispatched her and Velin to find the valley first. We're going to have a lot of trouble if that is the case.\"Drawing in a quick breath when he heard the elven War Priestess' name, Korith turned to the army behind him and bellowed, \"Get a move on, we're marching double time!\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**If you've enjoyed what you read and are interested in reading more, please consider supporting me at www.patreon.com/SethRing where you can read all of Book #2 and advanced chapters from Book #3.

He had intended to use it as camouflage but had tripped in his rush to hide, dropping the tree and killing the scout. Mina reported that they had discovered and killed an Elven scout as well, so the three of them left, traveling back to the citadel. Without a good way to track the enemy army, they had to rely on their own scouts to detect and report movement. Unsure if their plan to misdirect the enemy had worked, Thorn and Mina arrived at Moon Wolf Citadel and regrouped with Velin, who had been organizing the defenders. Gathering everyone together in front of the fortress, Thorn looked them over.The Wolfkin who had come down from the mountains numbered three hundred in total. Of those, two hundred were disciples who were trained for combat. Divided into fifty groups of four Wolfkin, the Temple of the Moon disciples looked disciplined and dangerous. Each group contained a member of each court and was led by a dual category Night Walker. While the rest of the disciples were still in training, they were all skilled and shouldn't be underestimated.Next to them, attempting to imitate the neat, cohesive appearance of the disciples, stood one hundred and fifty humans in assorted gear. The rag-tag group looked more like bandits than soldiers, though there were a few who were obviously veterans. Armed to the teeth and clad in whatever armor they could scrounge, the Freemen presented a wild and eclectic look. The only thing uniform about them was the longbow that each carried on their back. Six feet long and made of a variety of materials, every single bow was well polished by years of use. The last group was composed of the hunters from Greymane Village who had doubled as guards. With the influx of new settlers over the last few days, the group had grown to almost four hundred. However, as Thorn looked them over, he could not help but give a mental sigh. Even more poorly equipped than the Freemen, the village guards barely had a single weapon each.The Crimson Snake scouts that Thorn had killed had been dressed in full leather armor, armed with bows, swords, and knives, every weapon shiny and like new. Undoubtedly, the army that followed behind them was similarly well-equipped. The difference between the two forces was almost laughable, though Thorn was in no mood to laugh at this point. Had he not built Moon Wolf Citadel, the Crimson Snakes would have undoubtedly crushed their defenses without any trouble. As it was, the large walls should give them pause, though Thorn had no real hope that it would stop them. With another sigh, Thorn tossed aside his concerns and started to organize his troops.The attacking force was, at last estimation, 1500 players and natives. Considering that the pass was being guarded by half that number, Thorn knew that they were in for a tough fight. Thankfully, the walls compensated for their deficiency in numbers. In the coming battle, the attacking force would be the one compelled into action, while Thorn's force could simply wait behind their large walls.\"My lord, what are your commands?\" Captain Del'har saluted, bringing Thorn's wandering mind back to the present.\"How would you arrange them, captain?\" If Thorn had not been watching closely, he would have missed the sliver of disappointment that flashed across the Wolfkin captain's eyes.\"The most common tactic would be to use the hunter units to clog the top of the wall during the assault while the Freemen and disciples are held back as a counter strike.\"\"Hm. Casualties will be too high that way.\" Thorn shook his head, immediately rejecting that idea. \"Let's split the hunters into two groups. Get one group to cut long poles with forks on the end. Make them seven to eight feet long. The second group is to build some simple shields. Six feet high, four feet across. They'll need six foot poles as well. Two per board.\"They'll hold the wall in rotations along with the Freemen. Our armory is well stocked, so send them over to find armor and weapons. I've ordered extra arrows that we'll need to put out on the wall as well. Hopefully our diversionary tactic will give us a few more hours. We don't have long, so we should get to work. Oh, and send the leaders of the Night Walkers to talk to me.\"\"Yes, my lord!\" Executing another crisp salute, the captain whirled around and began barking orders, sending the army into a flurry of action. The Freemen began transporting bundles of arrows from the sub-level up to the wall, placing the stacks five feet apart the whole length of the wall. Imbued with a sense of urgency by the captain's commands, half of the hunters from Greymane village rushed out of the Citadel to cut long poles from the forest while the other half began to hammer together simple plank platforms. After setting the two human groups into motion, the captain called over the leaders of the temple forces, meeting Thorn at the gatehouse.\"Hello, everyone.\" Thorn looked up from the map he was studying. \"Please rise. We don't have a lot of time, so I am going to keep this really short. The main bulk of the fighting on the wall will be handled by the Freemen and the hunters. That said, I'm going to be putting a lot of weight on your shoulders. The Dusk Court has already been deployed, feeding us information about what the enemy is up to. They've been given strict orders to retreat before the enemy arrives, so I expect most of them will rejoin us.\"Once they come back, I'll be deploying the Dusk Court in the towers. Disciples of the Dawn Court will be joining me atop the wall. You will be responsible for passing my orders among the army and maintaining morale. Remember that your fellow fighters are not trained combatants, so pay close attention to anyone who is starting to panic. You'll be responsible for determining when the Freemen and hunters rotate off the wall.\"The Full Moon Court will be held in reserve in two groups. You can decide how you split, just try to make it even. You'll be stationed here in the gatehouse and will be responsible for clearing the wall if the enemy makes it up. You will also be the first line of defense should the gate be breached.\" Pausing for a moment, Thorn looked over the determined faces of his subordinates. The thought that some of them might not live past the coming battle was beginning to weigh on him. With a deep breath, Thorn pushed the feeling aside and turned to the last group.\"Those in the New Moon Court will have the most difficult job. We will be using the beheading strategy, aiming to kill as many of the enemy officers as we can, specifically targeting the native officers. Don't bother with the travelers initially, we want to cripple the enemy's native support as much as possible. I want to split you into three units. Two groups will leave the citadel before the enemy arrives. If the chance presents itself, I'll give a signal, and they'll assault the enemy headquarters, aiming to take the heads of the enemy generals and destroy any supplies the enemy camp has. The last group will stay in the citadel and will ambush any leaders that come to fight against me or any of our other leaders.\"After talking through the details of their deployment, the Wolfkin left the gatehouse to organize themselves, leaving Captain Del'har, Velin, and Thorn alone above the gate. Mina had run off with Akira to supervise the hunters who were cutting the long poles. Seeing Thorn's furrowed brow, Velin started to pat his shoulder and then hesitated, her hand hovering in the air for a moment before it dropped back to her side.\"What are you worrying about?\" she asked instead.\"This is going to be tough. The wall is a huge advantage, since they are not expecting it. In fact, I think surprise is our biggest advantage. My main concern is how to delay them. We need to hold out for three days, but I'm worried that we are not going to be able to survive a direct confrontation.\"\"Correct. To breach the walls or the gate, the Crimson Snakes will need to build ladders or a siege tower.\" Velin nodded, pointing at the forest outside the pass. \"They have ample supplies as well, so I don't expect it to take more than a day for them to construct something.  We can use the poles to deal with the ladders, but siege towers will be a problem.\"\"We will just have to do our best.\" Thorn felt more and more was slipping from his control, a feeling he did not like. \"My lord, the scouts are back,\" Captain Del'har spoke in a low voice.Striding over to the parapet, Thorn looked out over the entrance to the pass. Rushing from the forest, the sixteen Dusk Walkers that had been deployed to track the enemy army headed directly for the front gate. The Wolfkin were naturally tall and lean in form, making them suited to cross distances quickly, but this was the first time Thorn had seen them actually moving that fast. In the time it took him to arrive at the edge of the wall, they had already crossed half the distance to the citadel.One side of  the massive gate opened a crack, just enough for the Dusk Walkers to slip inside. Captain Del'har had hurried down to meet the scouts and soon returned with the two scouts that Thorn had worked with when he and Mina had gone to try and distract the enemy army.\"My lord.\" The Dusk Walkers saluted, their hands over their chests.\"I'm glad to see that everyone made it back.\" Thorn smiled warmly at them, equally happy to see that they followed his directions to retreat. \"What did you find out?\"\"The enemy is still progressing toward the southeast, though I expect that they will turn back toward this direction within half a day.\"\"When should we expect them to arrive?\"\"A conservative estimate would be within four hours. However, the army moves much slower than we do, so there is a chance that it will take them longer.\"\"Let's stick with the conservative estimate. Captain, please pass the word that we are to be finished with preparation within three hours. Actually, the sooner the better. I want everyone to be in place within the hour. Organize a squad of hunters to pass food out to everyone at their stations.\"\"Yes, my lord.\" With a crisp salute, the tall Wolfkin officer bounded out of the gatehouse to give his orders.\"What else did you find?\"\"The closest count we could get of the enemy army was around 1700, sir. The first fifteen hundred were as we expected. We counted 250 travelers with the Crimson Snake guild symbol, 250 other travelers who looked like guards, and 1000 native soldiers, with standard equipment. In addition, there were 200 other travelers, who wore a different symbol.\" The Dusk Walker handed over a piece of paper with a sketch of the symbol.On the paper Thorn saw a snake, drawn in a figure eight, its mouth holding its tail. Through the center of the figure eight was a sword, its pommel shaped like a dragon's claw. Handing the sketch to Velin, Thorn raised his eyebrows.\"Blood Guard,\" the slim elf said quietly.\"Ouroboros' group? Why would they be here? Didn't you say that his territory is farther south?\"\"Yes, he holds the region below this one. I'm not sure why he would have sent soldiers to support Angdrin. As far as I know, they are in direct competition.\" Velin pulled her notebook out and started to thumb through it. \"Give me a few minutes to think about it.\"\"Sure.\" Thorn dismissed the scouts after hearing the rest of their report. Once they had left, he leaned on the stone parapet, looking out over the entrance to the pass, a feeling of disquiet bubbling up in his heart. Over the last few weeks, Thorn felt as if he had been barreling along, tossed ever more quickly by the momentum of things outside his control. As his eye ran over the woods that had been cut back by the hunter squads, he idly wondered if the citadel below him had been a subconscious attempt to place down something immovable. There was so much going on in Nova Terra that it was honestly overwhelming. \"Ah, it is the Wolfkin!\"\"Pardon?\" Shaken from his musings by Velin's exclamation, Thorn straightened up and looked at the elf, who was scribbling furiously in her notebook.\"The Blood Guard are here because of the Wolfkin. Ouroboros' new class is tied to the Wolfkin race, just like your title is. It is highly likely that his advancement requires him to increase the corruption of the race as a whole, since his backer, Karrandras, the Betrayer, has been trying to do that.\"\"If that is true, doesn't that mean that I am destined to have to fight against him?\"\"Certainly. Though it would be more accurate to say that you are destined to battle his influence. It looks like you are two sides of a scale, seeking to draw the Wolfkin to your side. He is trying to bring out their bestial nature through the influence of Karrandras, while you are trying to bring out their civilized nature through the influence of Hati.\"\"Well, I'd say I'm winning so far.\"\"Correct. However, you have yet to face him directly.\" Pausing slightly, Velin stared into the distance, as if remembering something difficult.\"Even if I do, I'm confident in my combat ability.\"\"I'm not worried about your combat ability.\" Velin's eyes met Thorn's, taking him aback with their intensity. \"However, you will not only be competing to see who has the hardest fist. Your entire being will be weighed against his. Winning this conflict will require you to face off against his charisma, his leadership ability, and his influence.\"\"You don't seem confident in me,\" Thorn joked, trying to lighten the mood.\"Thorn, you are a gifted individual, but you are going up against the soon-to-be leader of one of the largest, most influential guilds in the game. It is not a matter of being confident or not. Please understand that I am on your side completely. However, that doesn't mean that I am going to pretend that you have the advantage in this coming conflict. Ouroboros is smart, careful, an outstanding player, a charismatic leader, and he wields serious influence in this game through his position in Ragnarok. You are in for a difficult fight.\"As Velin talked, Thorn grew quiet, his head bowed. She was right, it was going to be a difficult fight. Yet, was he really that disadvantaged? Slowly, Thorn had begun shedding many of the mental restrictions that he had brought into the game. He had begun to lose some of the social constraints that he had been raised with, shaking himself loose from their hold. More and more, he was feeling comfortable leveraging his advantages without worrying about what was fair.\"It may be difficult, but I will win.\" Raising his head, Thorn took a deep breath, his already large form seeming to grow and fill the whole room. \"Let them come. What is mine will stay mine, and no matter how impressive Ouroboros is, he will gain nothing more from me.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**If you've enjoyed what you read and are interested in reading more, please consider supporting me at www.patreon.com/SethRing where you can read all of Book #2 and advanced chapters from Book #3.

Are you kidding?\"Abashed, Korith and Telis stood in front of their raging commander, avoiding his burning gaze. Korith started to speak up, to point out that they had actually lost three scouts, but Telis tugged on his arm, silencing him. The motion did not escape Angdrin's gaze, causing him to break out into another string of curses.Angdrin had caught up with the army a few hours ago and immediately made them pitch camp. They had chased Mina for hours, but failed to find her or the valley. By the time the leader of the Crimson Snakes had arrived, they had wasted the whole day, causing him to fall into a towering rage.\"I told you where the valley is! What in Gaia's name made you think it was a good idea to change directions? Now we won't get to the valley until tomorrow, putting us behind. And worse, you make me look like an idiot.\" Just as he was about to start cursing again, the sound of footsteps approaching the tent made him swallow his words.The tent flap was pushed back, and a heavily armored player entered, removing his helmet to reveal his handsome face. His well formed features held a pleasant expression, naturally drawing in those who saw him and immediately defusing much of the tension in the room. Yet the perfect picture was somehow ruined by the trace of ruthlessness lurking in his eyes. \"It looks like you are having some trouble.\"\"My trouble is none of your concern, Ouroboros!\" Angdrin spat, turning his attention away from his disappointing underlings.\"This concerns the future of the guild, Angdrin. Of course I am concerned.\" Ouroboros smiled at the two disgraced lieutenants, indicating for them to leave with a slight tilt of his head. Thankful for the chance to escape, Telis and Korith left the tent as quickly as possible, their gratitude evident in their faces.\"I have it under control.\" Doing his best to control his fury, Angdrin sat down on a chair, and poured himself a glass of wine. Tossing back the full cup, he filled it again, not bothering to offer any to his competitor.\"I'm glad to hear that. Look, I'm not here to fight with you over this achievement. I know you probably don't believe me, but I really do want you to succeed. Sylith is too strong for either of us to fight, so our only chance is to support each other.\" Walking over to the table, Ouroboros took the jug of wine and filled up Angdrin's now empty cup. \"We gain nothing by constantly being at each other's throats. I heard you encountered some of my old companions, so I thought it would be appropriate for me to come and help you deal with them. And maybe mend a few bridges along the way.\"Staring into Ouroboros' handsome face, Angdrin could not help but begin to waver. There was a certain magnetism to Ouroboros' words and actions that made him want to go along with what Ouroboros said. Just as the words of agreement were about to escape his lips, he growled, slamming his cup down on the table, sending wine splashing everywhere. \"Ha, don't try tricks on me! I'm warning you. They will not work.\"\"Hmm?\" Ouroboros appeared taken aback by the outburst, his brow furrowing. \"Oh, right. I'm sorry. I'm still having trouble controlling my aura. It wasn't intentional.\"\"I'm sure.\" Angdrin stared at Ouroboros through narrowed eyes. Ever since the former Holy Guardian had gained a quad category class, his influence in Ragnarok had exploded. In part, it was due to the potential that his new class afforded him, attracting the attention of the elders who truly ran the guild. However, even more dangerous to Angdrin was the alluring aura that Ouroboros now carried. A devilish air hovered around the Exalted Devil Blood Berserker now, lending a coercive strength to his every word. Ideas that used to be easy to ignore now wormed their way into the listener's mind, slithering past defenses and common sense. The effect was subtle, hard to spot, and even harder to resist. It was only when Angdrin received a message from Velin, Ouroboros' old advisor, that he was able to understand his competitor's swift rise to power.\"Look, Angdrin, let's put our cards on the table. I see you as a valuable ally, and I don't think there is any good reason for us to be in competition.\" Ouroboros smiled disarmingly at the leader of the Crimson Snakes. \"Let's talk this through. And, if you're not happy with it by the end of our conversation, we can go our separate ways.\"\"Fine. You have five minutes.\" Knowing that he could not escape the conversation, Angdrin drained his cup again and placed it on the table, fixing his stormy eyes on Ouroboros' handsome face.\"That is fair. Look, you are in a bit of a bind. From what I understand of the situation, you lost some pretty important items to a thief. We're all familiar with Mr. Oberlin Danihoff, the Third, but what was out of my estimation was that he somehow connected with Thorn, one of my old party.\"\"A companion that you betrayed,\" spat Angdrin.\"A foolish player who was at the wrong place at the wrong time,\" Ouroboros corrected. \"Now, to top it off, it seems that some of my old companions have rejoined with Thorn and Oberlin and are competing with you for control of a valley with quite a few natural resources and a respawn point for a new race. To make matters worse, they seem to have found the valley before you.\"\"Thanks for the summary. If you're here just to rub this in my face, then you can leave. Now.\"\"No, I am here to help. To help you, to help myself, and to help Ragnarok. Look, I don't care about the valley. It is in your region, so if I gain control of it, I'd have nothing but trouble. I came here because I can help you deal with Mina, Velin, and even Thorn.\"\"You can deal with them? Are you kidding me? Have you ever seen that guy?\" Angdrin scoffed, pouring himself more wine.\"Yes, I have. I'm confident that I can take him down. Size is not everything, and I've spent enough time with him to know his weaknesses.\"\"Haha, I don't know if you are cocky or just an idiot.\"\"Why are you so cautious about him? He's just a giant noob. You should be much more concerned about Velin and Mina.\"\"Oh, sure. Both of those girls are quite dangerous. Mostly thanks to you, might I add?\" Angdrin shot Ouroboros a pointed look. \"But they are nothing compared to the walking tank. I watched him throw a wagon at five of my men, crushing them. A wagon. Did I mention that he popped my bubble with his bare hands? If Telis had not burned a finishing blow, he would have popped me with it!\"That 'giant noob' killed almost thirty of us without breaking a sweat. I don't know what you did to him, but whatever it was created a monster. An absolute monster. He is literally a walking boss. And I mean that in every sense of the word. He has crowd control, a rage ability, ranged and close combat attacks, and insane defense. If I didn't know better, I would have assumed that he was a native. You can fight him all you want, but I don't want a single piece of him.\"\"You make him sound much scarier than he actually is. Believe me, I spent quite a while with him.\"\"Whatever you say.\" Since Ouroboros did not want to listen, Angdrin abandoned his attempts to communicate how dangerous Thorn was. \"What do you get out of this? If you are not here for the valley, what are you after? I don't believe you'd help me for free.\"\"Of course not.\" Ouroboros ran a hand through his hair, flashing a smile. \"I want your trust. I want you to see that we don't have to be enemies. That we can work together.\"\"And?\"\"And, I want you to work with me against Sylith and the Silver Guard.\" Holding up a hand to stop Angdrin from interrupting him, Ouroboros continued. \"I know, we are both trying to become the guild leader of Ragnarok. But hear me out.\" As the sun set, painting the tops of the trees in pink light, the two commanders continued to talk, negotiating the details of their cooperation. The same pink light shrouded Moon Wolf Citadel in its soft glow, reminding Thorn of the massive cakes that his aunt would buy him for his birthday when he was younger. Currently, he was sitting on the balcony of the great room of the fortress, looking out at the last vestiges of light disappearing behind the mountains at the end of the valley. Sitting next to him on the wide balcony, Mina was feeding bits of pastry to Akira, who seemed determined to eat every last pastry in the game. Joining them, Velin shook her head when Thorn looked at her. Sitting on the blanket on the other side of Mina, the elven War Priestess frowned. \"We still have not seen them. I almost suspect your diversionary tactic worked.\"\"You say that as if it may not have.\"\"I mean no disrespect, but it was honestly a foolish idea.\" Velin rolled her eyes. \"Any intelligent player would have ignored the distraction and continued on their route.\"\"But was it? It worked, didn't it?\"\"Sure, but even a broken clock is right twice a day.\"\"Haha, that is true. Hey, it was worth a shot, and it paid off. We only need to hold on for two more days.\"\"Why two days? What happens after two days?\" Mina asked, looking between Velin and Thorn. Seeing the elf shrug, she turned her attention to Thorn. \"We've got friends on the way.\"\"Friends? What friends?\"Towering over her, even sitting, Thorn just smiled and patted Mina's head. Ignoring her grumbles, he asked Velin how the preparations were going. According to Velin's report, most of their forces were now relaxing as they waited for the Crimson Snake army to arrive. After finishing his meal, Thorn called Akira, who climbed up his large frame to sit on his shoulder. Together, Mina, Velin, and Thorn toured the citadel, looking over the defenses.Large wooden shields had been constructed and hauled up onto the wall, raised to defend against arrows. Each shield was supported by two poles and contained a few angled openings to allow for firing arrows at anyone who attacked the wall. Velin had been astounded to see a small groove built into the inside of the wall designed to take the weight of the shields off of the soldiers. Similarly, special grooves were cut into the top of the wall to allow for the long poles to be secured, making it difficult to lean a ladder up against the wall or to place a siege tower right up against it. When designing the citadel, Thorn had poured countless hours into making it as easy to defend as possible, not sparing a thought for how long it would take to complete such an intricate set of instructions. Ultimately, the system simply did not care how intricate the design was. So long as the money and resources were there, the system would build it. On top of the wall, Freemen and hunters from Greymane Village sat between bundles of arrows, eating and laughing together. Scouts stood every fifty feet along the one thousand foot long wall, watching the dark forest at the entrance to the pass for any sign of the approaching enemy. Seeing that the forest was quiet, Thorn instructed them to come wake him up if the enemy army arrived and went to bed. He had ordered a custom built bed through a carpentry shop in Fantasia and collapsed on it with a contented sigh. The next morning, after a big breakfast and checking on the wall, Thorn decided to spend what time he had following up with the class he had gotten from Elder Havva back in the village. Figuring he should start with finding the other Dawn Court disciples to ask them, Thorn headed for the Temple district of the citadel.Most of the disciples were either practicing their forms in front of the statue of Hati in the Temple district or chanting together to complete the morning lessons. The chanting caught Thorn's attention, so he walked over to see what was going on. Despite the fact that Thorn had joined the temple as a disciple and even chosen to study under the Dawn Court, he had yet to attend any lessons or find out what his responsibilities were. The Temple Elder was leading the chanting class, so Thorn stood nearby, waiting until the chanting had finished.\"Disciple pays his respects to Temple Elder.\"\"There is no need for you to greet me that way.\" Elder Havva shook his head. \"Simply calling me elder will suffice.\"\"Elder Havva, I am a disciple of the temple now. I should follow the protocol.\"\"Forget the protocol. Unless of course, you want me to call you Lord Greymane, the Moon Wolf, Avatar of the Great Night Wolf, every time I speak to you,\" chuckled the elderly Wolfkin, clasping his hands behind his back. \"Of course, I also need to get on one knee when I say it.\"\"Please, please don't.\" Thorn recoiled in mock horror, waving his hands.\"Then call me elder. Now, what did you need from me?\"\"Certainly, elder.\" Thorn walked beside the elder as they made their way toward the fortress. \"I was hoping that you could help me to understand the courts a bit better and that you could tell me more about how I am supposed to advance my class.\"\"You chose the Court of the Dawn, hm?\"\"Yes, I thought their abilities would come in handy in my other roles.\"\"It was a good choice. You have natural presence which helps immensely with things like oration. The courts are relatively simple, though not all of their rules apply to you. You may study under any Dawn Walker who is interested in teaching you. Normally, a disciple would need to seek out a teacher and convince them to take them on as a student. As you are the current Greymane and the avatar of the Great Wolf, I imagine you will have the opposite problem. \"Thankfully, the Dawn Court fights more with their words than their weapons, so there shouldn't be too much bloodshed when the teachers are determining who will take you on as a student. Once this situation with the valley is resolved, take some time to familiarize yourself with the various teachers, and they will let you know what you need to know regarding advancing your class.\"\"Thank you, elder. Hopefully we can resolve this fight quickly.\" Thorn smiled calmly.\"I'm sure you will. Just remember, your enemies are not only those you see in front of you. Karrandras, the Betrayer, has long sought to dominate and enslave the Wolfkin race, and your defeat of him in the trial should not make you complacent. In fact, it should make you even more wary of his attack. He excels at twisting desire to achieve his purpose and will not rest simply because you beat one of his minions.\"As Elder Havva finished speaking Akira rushed over. \"Master, master, the enemies are here. They just arrived!\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**If you've enjoyed what you read and are interested in reading more, please consider supporting me at www.patreon.com/SethRing where you can read all of Book #2 and advanced chapters from Book #3.

It would have been a peaceful, artistic scene, with the army and the citadel presenting a sharp contrast against the wild mountains to the sides if it wasn't for the steady stream of loud swearing spewing from the commander's mouth as he stared in abject fury at the citadel wall.\"Is that Angdrin?\" Mina nudged Velin.\"Yes, at least I think so.\" The elf nodded, examining her notebook. \"Though he is normally much calmer than this.\"Standing atop the gatehouse, Thorn watched the raging leader of the Crimson Snakes with interest. The enemy army had arrived almost an hour ago but had not sent anyone forward to negotiate. Instead, Angdrin had exploded with anger, swearing and throwing things as he raved. Thorn had not been exposed to much foul language growing up, so he was finding this episode quite instructive.After a few more minutes, another figure came forward, putting a hand on Angdrin's shoulder. Dressed in heavy black armor, with a full helm, Thorn could not identify who it was, though he felt immediate revulsion at the sight. Talking together, the two were far enough from the wall that their voices could not be heard, but it wasn't that difficult to figure out what they were talking about. After speaking to the black armored figure, Angdrin stepped forward, his crimson cape billowing behind him.\"Greetings. I am Angdrin, leader of the Crimson Snakes, vice leader of Ragnarok. We wish to speak to the ruler of this castle.\"\"Steady, Thorn.\" Velin appeared at the giant's side. \"He is trying to subtly threaten us.\"\"Don't worry. I know what to do.\" Thorn nodded to Captain Del'har who stepped forward.\"The valley is closed, traveler. Please go back where you came from.\" The tall Wolfkin leaned over the parapet, shouting down to Angdrin.\"We come in peace and bring many benefits. Consider well before you reject us.\"\"Peace? Then why do I see an army?\" Scoffing, the Captain laughed at the Crimson Snake commander. \"You are not welcome here. Take your soldiers and leave.\"\"You are making a huge mistake.\" Veins in Angdrin's neck bulged briefly as he struggled to keep his anger under control.\"Don't worry about us. The valley is closed.\" Watching the captain disappear from the top of the wall, it was all that Angdrin could do to keep himself from rushing forward to smash the gate. With a visible effort, he took deep breaths, calming himself.\"Was this part of your plan?\" Despite all his restraint, he could not stop himself from snapping at the black armored figure as he walked back to the army. \"A twenty-five foot high wall? Where did this castle come from?\"\"I'm not sure, but it is certainly a mixed blessing.\"\"A mixed blessing? Are you serious? How could having a massive fortress blocking me off from my land be considered a good thing?\"\"Sure, it is in your way now. But what about after you conquer it? It won't disappear, right? That means you will have a massive fortress. Imagine people's faces when you speak to them from atop that wall.\" Ouroboros' voice drifted softly around Angdrin, cooling his anger and hardening his determination.\"That is true. Per our agreement, the land and everything on it is mine.\" Angdrin looked at Ouroboros from the corner of his eyes. \"That includes the fortress, right?\"\"Of course it does. Like I said, I'm only here to prove myself trustworthy. The spoils will all go to you this time around.\"\"If that is the case, then we attack.\"\"You don't want to try negotiating one more time?\"\"No.\" Angdrin was determined. \"You know how stubborn natives are. The only way they will listen is with a sword through their gut.\" Lifting his hand, he was about to command his army to advance when the hair on the back of his neck rose and a sense of danger swept over him. \"[Blood Shie...]!\"*Whump*Angdrin had almost finished summoning his [Blood Shield] when a massive bolt from a siege crossbow ripped through the air, glancing off the half formed red orb in front of him, sending him tumbling to the ground. The bolt smashed into the ground, showering the area in dirt. It had come without warning and would have skewered Angdrin through his chest if he had not been instinctively moving to the side. Even with his defensive ability, the sheer force of the attack glancing off his shield knocked him from his feet. Rolling over, Angdrin scrambled to his feet, looking around wildly. For a moment, the only sound in the pass was his ragged panting.*Creak*The clear sound of a crossbow being reloaded drew all eyes to the top of the gate where Thorn stood, his arbalest loaded and leveled. Silent, he stood there, his armor glinting silver in the morning light. At the sight of the giant, Angdrin took an instinctive step back, watching him warily. It took him a moment to realize that the bolt was not even pointed at him. Thorn's arbalest never wavered, his large hands holding it as still as stone, fixed firmly on the player in black armor. \"The valley is closed.\" Thorn's deep voice brooked no argument. \"Thorn!\" All of the fury that Angdrin had been trying so hard to rein in burst forth like a river through a breached dam, completely erasing any restraint he had possessed. \"Charge! Kill them all!\"Responding with a roar, the Crimson Snakes surged forward into the pass, weapons drawn. A block of archers drew their bows, sending arrows flying toward the top of the wall to try and provide cover for the charging warriors. Behind them, healers began casting buffs on the warriors, trying to minimize damage as much as possible.\"Shields up!\" bellowed Captain Del'har, sending the top of the wall into a flurry of action. Lifting the large wooden shields, the soldiers rested one end in the slot cut in the wall and propped up the other end with the wooden poles that had been cut from the forest.\"Return fire!\"The Freemen archers stepped forward, their well used bows drawn to the fullest. A sharp hiss rose as the arrows shot forward, falling on the charging warriors. Groups of four arrows targeted the same warrior, causing casualties immediately. Each group of archers contained four Freemen and two hunters. The leader of each group would call a target and all four archers would fire on the target, usually causing instant death. Next to them, the two hunters from Greymane Village would have arrows ready to hand them.Wave after wave of concentrated fire poured from the wall, cutting down the Crimson Snake fighters. Ouroboros, seeing the shields go up, instantly knew that things were going to go poorly for the Crimson Snakes and called his forces back. Angdrin, oblivious to the damage being caused to his army, charged blindly forward, his elite squad surrounding him. Seeing them run forward, Captain Del'har commanded four squads to focus fire on Angdrin's group. Twelve arrows shot out with deadly accuracy, each aiming for one of the warriors around the Crimson Snake leader. Almost instinctively, the four targeted warriors lifted their shields, knocking aside the arrows with ease. Seeing that the arrows would have no effect, the Captain commanded the archers to resume firing at the regular soldiers.Thorn had kept his arbalest aimed at the black armored enemy, who had not moved a single step from his original position. The black armored warrior gave Thorn a dangerous feeling. Seeing that he was still just standing there, Thorn swung his arbalest toward Angdrin, watching for movement. Still, the black armored man just stood in place, watching.Tearing his eyes away, Thorn aimed at Angdrin's advancing party and fired, sending the large bolt flying through the air. This time, Angdrin was ready and a quick chant raised a red swirling shield over the group. Splintering on the shield, the bolt exploded into shards, peppering the surrounding fighters with slivers of wood and steel. A second and third bolt soon followed the fate of the first, hardly slowing their advance.By this point, the warriors had reached the wall and began to toss out grappling hooks, trying to gain purchase on the wall. As fast as they landed on the wall, the hunters would dash forward, severing the ropes under the cover of the archers. Back and forth, the two forces fought in a mad scramble to control the top of the wall. Near the front gate, Angdrin and his group stopped, the warriors keeping their shields up. Angdrin began to chant, his voice growing in power as the chant came to a climax.\"Velin, what is that?\" Thorn asked, his voice carrying over the din of the battle.\"A movement spell, they're coming up to the top of the gate.\" Velin calmly pointed to a growing red dot in the air near them. \"Everyone retreat.\" Thorn waved for the Wolfkin disciples that had crowded around to move away. \"I don't want to reveal any more strength than we need to. Mina, can you help me handle them?\"\"Of course!\" excited to be asked, Mina began to mutter under her breath, cold air beginning to surge around her.The red dot expanded suddenly, sending out a rippling ring of burning heat. The area inside the ring rippled, and Angdrin appeared, surrounded by his five guards with their shields up. Instead of the wall of weapons that they expected to see, they found themselves in a largely empty space, facing a charging giant and a metric ton of icy snow.\"[Avalanche!]\" Mina's spell created an abrupt snowfall over the group, slowing their movements and trapping them in three feet of snow. The burning temperature around them plummeted, reaching freezing in a matter of seconds, causing their weapons and armor to creak alarmingly as the temperature change strained the metal. \"[Burning Blood!]\" Not to be outdone, Angdrin responded instantly, sending out a wave of heat to melt the snow, following it up by summoning three large fireballs, only for them to be pierced by a barrage of ice spikes. Seeing his fireballs fizzling out, Angdrin gritted his teeth. \"Mina!\"\"Hey, Angdrin? How is it going? Enjoying yourself these days? I heard that Ouroboros has been walking all over you. That can't be very comfortable.\" Somehow, the Ice Witch managed to keep up a steady stream of small talk as she summoned endless waves of ice spikes, forcing the Blood Mage into a defensive position.\"Shut up!\" Angdrin squeezed the words out from between his clenched jaws as he maintained his shield. Just about to call for assistance, he felt a movement at his side and looked over in time to see one of his elite guards being blown off his feet. As Mina had engaged Angdrin, Thorn charged forward striking out with his metal club. The warrior in his path smashed his sword on his shield, creating a thick red barrier on his shield's face. Tensing his muscles, he got ready to absorb the blow, planning on creating an opportunity for his teammates to counter-attack. Without needing to communicate verbally, the other warriors rushed forward, intending to strike as soon as Thorn's momentum was halted.Unfortunately for the Crimson Snake warriors, nothing went as planned. Thorn continued to charge forward, his blow connecting with the blood colored shield. With a sharp crack that rang over the battlefield, the shield shattered, and the force of the blow continued forward, blasting the warrior off of his feet and over the parapet. Flying straight backwards, the warrior did not begin to fall to the ground for almost twenty feet, going straight over the heads of the Crimson Snake army. Smashing into the ground, his body cut a furrow in the battlefield, tumbling over and over before exploding into particles of light.Awestruck, the army looked up toward the top of the wall and witnessed two more of the elite guards meeting the same fate as the first. The last two guards looked at Thorn with horror, their minds trying to catch up to the fact that he had just completely obliterated three of them. Before they could react, he was on them, cutting them down with a single sharp swing. Turning his head, Thorn's eyes landed on Angdrin, who flinched.Taking advantage of the Blood Mage's distraction, Mina summoned a larger ice spear that thrust forward, punching through the blood shield. Wincing in pain as the ice spear scraped along his ribs, Angdrin panicked at the sight of Thorn striding toward him. \"[Blood Escape!]\" With a shrill yell, the commander of the Crimson Snakes disappeared in a bloody flash.\"[Sub Zero!]\" A split second late, Mina tried to stun Angdrin, causing the temperature where he had stood a moment before to plunge to arctic levels. A large blob of blood that had not yet disappeared froze instantly, dropping to the ground where it shattered into countless pieces.On the battlefield below, Angdrin reappeared, stumbling to the ground. A large wound formed in his stomach, caused by the blood he had left behind. Groaning with pain, he struggled to get up, staggering toward Ouroboros, who still stood calmly in the same place that he stood since the beginning of the attack.Mina, rushing to the edge of the wall, grumbled. She had hoped to kill Angdrin in one blow, but had been a split second late. Still, forcing him to retreat was not a bad result. Turning to Thorn, who was looking quite impressed, she beamed.\"Ha, see that? He did not stand a chance.\"\"You were very impressive.\" Thorn had to admit that he had underestimated the short witch. Up to this point, he had only seen her fight as supporting ranged damage. However, in this fight, she had stepped up and acted as a direct combatant, dueling Angdrin directly. \"Just see that you remember it the next time you assign tasks.\" Mina nodded smugly. \"Hey, look over there. Something is happening with that armored guy.\"At the entrance to the pass, Ouroboros finally moved. Stepping forward, he supported Angdrin, who was about to collapse, while waving for a healer. Putting his arm around Angdrin's shoulders to steady him, Ouroboros led him away from the castle wall. \"A healer is coming. Just rest up for a moment, and you will be good as new.\" Ouroboros' voice was calming, causing Angdrin's tension to bleed out of him. Opening his mouth to speak, he suddenly choked, coughing up a mouthful of blood. Unable to see the smile on Ouroboros' face because of his helmet, Angdrin struggled to speak, his hand landing powerlessly on Ouroboros' chest plate. Losing strength, his hand dropped, leaving a bloody streak as it fell.\"His wounds are too grievous. It looks like they used a powerful poison.\" Ouroboros spoke with sorrow in his voice as he laid the now powerless Blood Mage on the ground. The approaching healer cast her spell, but to no avail. She could only watch, helpless, as her leader disappeared into particles of light.\"Collect his belongings, and sound the retreat. We need to regroup.\" Ouroboros looked at the citadel blocking the entrance to the valley as he slipped the dagger in his hand back into his inventory. \"But fear not, I will lead us to victory on Angdrin's behalf.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

Watching them go, Captain Del'har began organizing the defenders, taking stock of the wounded and ordering more arrows brought up onto the wall. After settling everything, the tall Wolfkin met with Thorn and the girls in the gatehouse, where they were watching the remains of the Crimson Snake army.\"My lord,\" the captain saluted, \"we eliminated approximately two hundred of the enemy. We also managed to kill the Crimson Snake leader and a group of five elite guards.\"\"What were our losses?\" Velin asked from the side, ready to jot down the numbers.\"Two dead, fifteen wounded, Lady Velin.\"\"Hmmm, that's not bad.\" Thorn turned around to look at Mina. \"It seems that you took a bigger chunk out of Angdrin than you realized.\"\"No, I don't think so.\" Surprisingly, Mina did not take the credit like she normally would. Her eyes remained fixed on the tent that had been set up outside the pass for the black-armored figure. \"My spell did not hit enough of him to be lethal. He should have gotten healing before he died. That black-armored guy must have done something.\" Taken aback by the uncharacteristic seriousness in Mina's voice, Thorn followed her gaze to the tent.\"Why would someone harm their team...\" Thorn's voice stopped abruptly, but he couldn't stop his last words from echoing. As the deep voice faded away, the gatehouse grew quiet. \"It was a stupid question.\" After an awkward moment, Thorn chuckled. He knew exactly why someone would conspire to harm their teammate.\"It is not a stupid question, though it is a bit silly.\" Velin walked up next to Thorn, pushing her hair behind her ear. \"Rather than ask why, we should ask, 'for what' would someone harm an ally. That would undoubtedly depend on who their ally is.\"\"Point taken. If Angdrin is a member of Ragnarok, the only person who would be willing to betray him would be someone of equal standing. And, given his pretentious nature, the only people he would consider of equal standing with him would be the other leaders of Ragnarok. That is Ouroboros, isn't it?\"Hardly able to breathe because of the stifling air that had settled over the gatehouse, Mina poked Thorn in the side with an ice spike.\"We are not your enemies, big guy. You don't have to crush us,\" she complained.\"Hmm? Oh, sorry.\" Thorn took a deep breath, and the atmosphere lightened considerably. \"I'm not sure why that keeps happening.\"\"What are you going to do if it is Ouroboros?\" Velin asked, her eyes carefully watching Thorn's face.\"You know? I don't know yet. Probably hit him. Maybe a couple times. But I don't know. I guess we'll find out when we confirm who that is. Until then, let's keep defending.\"\"Speaking of defending, I have some bad news.\" Velin flipped closed her notebook, storing it in her inventory. \"It is highly unlikely that we will be able to maintain this sort of kill to death ratio moving forward.\"\"Yeah, I'm aware.\" Thorn nodded. \"Well, I'm not,\" Mina pouted, glaring at Velin and Thorn. \"I hate it when you talk in code.\"\"No problem, we can dumb it down for you.\" Thorn grinned at her and then immediately ducked to avoid an ice spike. Laughing, he explained, \"That was an anger fueled attack. No plan, no purpose other than grinding us away. Add to that their lack of ability to get up the wall, and it makes sense that it was so one sided. Maybe if Angdrin and his squad had been able to break through and open the gate it could have worked.\"\"Correct. That is the primary method that the Crimson Snakes employ. Angdrin and his team do the heavy lifting while the rest of their forces act as slightly above average fodder,\" Velin chipped in.\"Too bad for them, they met us.\" Mina gloated, giving Thorn a high five. \"But what does that change? We still have a really defensive position.\"\"That is true, but if you look out past their camp, you can see they are starting to clear trees.\" Thorn pointed toward the entrance to the pass. \"Chances are that they are building ladders as we speak. Possibly even siege towers. The next time, their goal will be to move the fight from the bottom of the wall to the top of the wall. Our defenses will not allow them to achieve that goal easily, but if they do, they will have an absolute advantage.\"They not only have a larger number of soldiers than we do, but they have a solid core of players who are better than almost any force we have. Expect the next fight to be bloody and difficult. The only plus side is that it will probably take them at least a day to finish building the siege weapons, which gets us a day closer to our goal. Honestly, as long as we can make it through tomorrow, I think we should be okay.\"\"Have you figured out a way to get Ragnarok to back off?\" Velin's normally impassive face lit up.\"Yeah, I think so. It is a bit of a gamble, but I'm pretty sure it should work. We will find out tomorrow night, though, in order for it to work, we need to maintain control of the valley, which means keeping the control point. So, let's make sure we keep them out.\" Taking a deep breath, Thorn had a hard time keeping the smile off his face. Tomorrow would be the final showdown, the final fight for the valley. If he could keep control of it, he would be paving his path in Nova Terra. If he lost it, everything he had worked for so far would evaporate. \"All the cards will be played tomorrow, we will just have to wait and see how they fall. But I'm getting ahead of myself.\" With a wave, Thorn left the girls and went to find Elder Havva. There was much to do. Later that night Thorn stood on the wall with the Elder, the captain, and both girls. He had been trying to explain to Mina why she was not coming with him to raid the enemy camp.\"Mina, you are not stealth based.\" His attempts were not going well.\"Oh, like you are? Look Velin, it is a super sneaky giant. Don't worry, if he just stands still people will mistake him for a tree on account of his giant head. He can blend right into the forest.\"\"Mina, Thorn is in charge, so if he says you are not going, then you are not going.\" Velin did her best to keep the corners of her lips from curving up.\"Mina, I need you here so you can help me get back into the citadel without having to open the gate. I'll need you to create stairs or something for me to climb. This is serious, so stop messing around. If you can't do it, then I'll come up with a different plan.\"\"But why does Velin get to go?\"\"So I don't die. You will see plenty of action tomorrow, but right now I need you to follow directions.\" \"I...\" Thorn was trying to be as patient as possible, but the rough edge of his annoyance must have peeked through his slow speech because the response on Mina's lips died out, and she looked away. \"Fine, I'll stay here.\"\"Thank you.\" Thorn rubbed the bridge of his nose as he thought through the plan. \"Velin, you're with me. We might need to make a quick getaway, so my apologies if I pick you up without your permission. Captain, you are in charge of the wall until I get back. If something goes wrong and I don't make it back, hold for as long as you can. Alright. Lets go.\"Grabbing the slim elf around the waist, Thorn placed a hand on the edge of the wall and casually hopped over the edge. Keeping his grip on the wall, he waited until he was hanging fully before he let go, sliding down a few feet and then pushing off to land on the ground. As he put Velin down, he couldn't help but wonder if he would be able to completely encircle her waist with two hands. Shaking away the errant thoughts, Thorn walked toward the Crimson Snake camp.From the flurry of action at the camp, it was obvious that the sentries on night watch spotted him. The flurry of activity only expanded when Thorn unrolled a giant white cloth, waving it above his head. Soon, a couple hundred Crimson Snake soldiers and players had circled him, holding weapons. Thorn was amused to see that they stood at least thirty feet away, well out of reach, and even maintained that distance as he advanced.Holding the white cloth, Thorn strode toward the Crimson Snake camp, just slow enough that Velin did not have to run to keep up. The jostling crowd of players and natives that surrounded them struggled slightly to maintain the proper distance from him as he moved, causing him to smile. By the time they arrived, most of the camp had been woken up and was gathered to watch as Thorn and Velin entered.\"Hold. Are you here to surrender?\" One of the Blood Guard held out his hand for Thorn and Velin to stop.\"I would like to speak to your leader. Please take me to them.\" Thorn made no effort to control the volume of his voice, and his deep rumble woke those who had not yet gotten up.\"There is no...\"\"Take me to your leader.\" The full weight of Thorn's presence fell on the Blood Guard, causing him to shrink back slightly, his face paling. Before he could fall back more than a step, a hand fell on his shoulder, steadying him. Stepping out of the shadows, the black-armored figure gestured for Thorn and Velin to follow and made their way to the tent in the center of the camp.\"Be careful,\" Velin whispered as she watched the figure in front of them, a note of fear in her voice. \"I'm almost 100% certain that is Ouroboros. His quad category class is incredibly powerful. We need to avoid a direct fight if possible.\"\"Relax, we are just here for a chat.\"\"I'm just afraid that we will not be the ones deciding that soon.\"A crimson tent sat in the center of the Crimson Snake camp. The golden symbol of the Crimson Snakes adorned the tent flaps, but it was two Blood Guard players who stood outside guarding the entrance. Not bothering to see if they followed, the black-armored figure walked inside. Ducking to follow them into the tent, Thorn was surprised to see how comfortably furnished the tent was. Much larger on the inside than the outside, the tent was divided into multiple richly furnished rooms.A thick carpet covered the floor of the tent and elegant furniture dotted the main room. A large, throne-like chair with the symbol of the Crimson Snakes carved into the back dominated the far end of the room, and the black-armored figure walked toward it, taking off their helmet and tossing it onto a small table. Sitting down, Ouroboros stared at Thorn and Velin, his face glum.\"Please, have a seat.\" Sighing, he rubbed his face, as if he could rub away his frustration. \"Would you like anything to eat or drink? I believe there is some wine around here somewhere.\"\"No, thanks. And it may be better for your furniture if I stay standing.\" Thorn chuckled.\"Eh, suit yourself. It isn't my furniture.\" Ouroboros shrugged. \"If you are not here for a drink, what are you here for? Only a fool would believe that you are going to surrender, but only a fool would walk into their enemy's camp alone. So I have to admit, I'm at a loss as to what to think about you.\"\"Haha, that is a pretty fair assessment.\" Nodding, Thorn examined Ouroboros closely. He had been torn about how he would feel facing the person who had orchestrated his betrayal, but he found that he had been entirely wrong. Thorn had been sure that he would have trouble controlling his anger when he finally met up with Ouroboros, but that did not prove to be the case. The anger was still there, but it was slow, deep and burning. Instead, Thorn felt a strange apathy, as if Ouroboros was a stranger.\"Look, I don't mean to suggest that we have to be enemies, but it would certainly seem like we have fallen on opposite sides in this conflict.\" On the large chair, Ouroboros leaned back, one of his fingers tapping his armrest. \"I took over this operation until Angdrin can return. And it is really hard for me to give up guild business like this. Why don't we work something out that will work for both of us? Once everything with the valley is arranged, we could reform the team. I miss playing with all of you.\"\"That's it?\" The coldness in Thorn's heart solidified into ice.\"What else is there?\" Ouroboros spread his hands, confused.\"Disappointing.\" Somehow, Thorn's deep voice pierced Ouroboros, causing him to lower his hands, a flash of desolation crossing his eyes. His hands dropped to grip his armrests tightly, opening his mouth as if he was going to say something. Seeing his hesitation, Thorn suddenly felt a wave of fatigue wash over his soul. Shaking his head, Thorn spoke.\"We are here to discuss terms on behalf of Lord Greymane, the Moon Wolf, Lord of Moon Wolf Citadel. And to deliver a present.\" All friendliness was gone from Thorn's voice. \"You are to take your army and retreat, as your current actions are unlawful. Per the ancient and just laws of the empire, you have intruded on the sovereign ground of a native race. Withdraw or face the wrath of the empire.\"Penalties range from paying reparations to execution of all participants. If you continue, your full guild will be forfeit. Given your lack of awareness of the laws, we will agree to not pursue any reparations for the damage your army has caused to this point, should you choose to withdraw. If you choose not to withdraw, we will prosecute Ragnarok to the furthest extent of the law.\"You have until nine o'clock tomorrow morning to pull your army back, taking nothing from the land that you did not bring, but removing everything you did. We will welcome a diplomatic group at the beginning of next week, but any other forces will be met with appropriate force. Those are the terms. And this is the present.\" Thorn placed the white cloth on the table, covering Ouroboros' helmet. \"Given your history of making the wrong choice, I think it is likely that you will need this.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Did you know that Book #2 and Book #3 are already finished?

Come explore the world of Nova Terra and help me determine where the story goes.You can find out more about me at www.sethring.com", "\"Are you serious?\" Ouroboros broke the silence that had fallen over the tent, his quiet voice cutting through the tension like a hot knife. \"Why must you be so serious about this? Is there really no room to compromise? Look, I don't know how you connected with Lord Greymane, but the ownership of the valley isn't something that can be resolved like this. Ragnarok has invested a significant amount of money in this corner of Nova Terra, and we cannot afford to give up on resources just because a native said we should.\"Believe me when I say that you don't want to put yourself on the wrong side of Ragnarok. Not just because of the influence that the guild has in game. I know we talked about this before, but you don't seem to have taken my words to heart, Thorn. This game is way more than a place to run around and complete fun quests. There are serious business interests tied into the economy of the game, and behind the guilds are major businesses. \"They are not going to step aside because some NPC wants them to. This is even more true of the top ten guilds. Ragnarok has immense sway in the real world, and it is not wise to try and stand in the way when they want something. I know our last interaction was not pleasant, but please have some understanding about your position in all of this. For guilds like Ragnarok, players are there to be used or run over. I'm choosing to be useful, and I hope that you will make that same choice. It is the only way for people like us to survive.\"Rising from his seat, Ouroboros walked closer.\"There are forces at work that are beyond your understanding. Forces that will not hesitate to apply pressure in the real world. Unbearable pressure. Don't throw away your life simply because you had a negative experience. There is still time for you to join the right side, the side of progress and growth. There is always a place for strong players in Ragnarok, and both of you are among the strongest. Why not join me? Give up this pointless struggle and join the Blood Guard. I can guarantee the best treatment, both in game and in the real world.\"\"I...\" Velin, who had been standing at Thorn's side, opened her mouth, a haunted look in her eyes.\"Velin, you left before we had a chance to have a good conversation.\" Turning his attention to the elven War Priestess, Ouroboros held her gaze, his eyes full of sincerity. \"I am sorry I was so preoccupied, but you understand how much work building a faction is. Please don't throw away what we had just because I was being stupid. I know I was not including you enough. I was stupid to think that I could do everything on my own. Since you and Mina left, I realized how important you are to me. Please give me another chance.\" Staring into her eyes, Ouroboros stretched out his hand, pleading. \"Please.\"\"I...\" Velin's words caught in her throat, her emotions turbulent. Slowly, she lifted her hand, reaching for Ouroboros. Just before they touched, a massive hand closed over her slim palm, enveloping it. The huge palm covering her hand was warm, causing Velin to realize how cold her own hand was. With a shiver, she woke up from her daze, the warmth cutting through her confusion.\"Try to bewitch one of my people again, and I will remove your head. Permanently.\" Thorn's deep voice was mild, yet somehow that made his threat all the more scary. There was an absolute conviction in his words that was as firm as stone.Stepping back, Ouroboros stared at Thorn, his eyes hard. The soft, persuasive air that had surrounded him was replaced with a sharp, cold aura.\"That is your answer? You are going to put up a pointless struggle? You are going to willingly bring suffering on yourself and your companions in both the game and the real world? Your choice condemns them to death.\"\"I choose a life of my own. I choose not to be another's dog. And I choose to grant that to my companions.\" Thorn chuckled mirthlessly. \"However, I would appreciate it if you would pass on a message for me. Tell your masters that they should keep the game in the game. Let real life be real life. Let Nova Terra be Nova Terra. You would do well to remember that, as well. Lord Greymane's message has been delivered to you, and by proxy, your guild. You can make your choice accordingly. Either retreat and this whole thing will be written off, or fight and pay the consequences.\" Still holding Velin's hand, Thorn turned to leave.\"If that is the case, why should I let you go?\" Ouroboros' tone had taken on a dangerous edge. \"What stops me from cutting you down where you stand?\"Stopping, Thorn looked over his shoulder and smirked. \"You will let me go because, if I start a fight here, you will have no chance of taking the citadel. Tomorrow, you will rely on your siege weapons, and we will rely on our wall. And we'll see whose is better.\" Without waiting for a reply, Thorn strode out of the tent, easily pushing aside the guards that stepped up to stop him.Stumbling to the side, the guards looked at Ouroboros, who stood in the entrance to the tent, staring at Thorn's broad back, his face inscrutable. Since their leader did not make a move, the guards stood to the side as well, letting Thorn pull Velin out of the camp. Enemy soldiers gathered to either side, but they did not impede Thorn's path, and soon Thorn and Velin reached the edge of the camp.\"That went better than I expected,\" Thorn muttered, his voice so quiet that Velin had to strain her ears to hear it. \"But we're not out of the woods yet. Velin, I'm going to start moving quickly in just a moment. Be ready to heal.\"Nodding mutely, Velin's mind couldn't help but stray, returning to what she had just experienced. When they entered the tent with Ouroboros, she had been on guard against him. She knew firsthand just how easy it was for him to twist the truth, reversing black and white with a few words. Yet nothing had prepared her for just how invasive his words were. It must have been a new class ability. His words had deadened her resistance, slipping past all of her defenses and muddling her ability to think. Emotions that she had buried started to surface, casting her into an illusory world. Causing her to believe that he was telling the truth.She shuddered. If Thorn had not been there... If he had not been able to withstand the corrupting influence of Ouroboros' words, she could not even begin to imagine what would have happened. Tightening her grip on Thorn's big hand, she was grateful for the warmth it brought.\"Hold on.\" His deep voice sounded, and Velin found herself swept from her feet.Lifting the slim elf, Thorn launched himself forward, instantly accelerating. Behind him, he could hear shouts of anger and panic. Not bothering to look back, Thorn summoned his armor and fixed his eyes on the wall of the citadel, focusing on nothing but reaching the wall. Behind him, a furious shout rang out.\"Thorn! Kill them!\"Ouroboros had watched until Thorn was almost out of the camp when a commotion caught his attention. Walking around the tent, Ouroboros looked toward the back of the camp where licking tongues of flame leapt into the sky. His eyes going wide at the site of the siege equipment they had spent all day constructing burning up in flames, Ouroboros lost it. Screaming out in rage, he roared out his orders.Thorn paid the shouts no mind and focused on running. This was the first time that he had truly tested his top speed since the game started and, as his stride lengthened, the land under his feet flashed by. Velin, held to his chest, found herself having trouble catching her breath as the wind whipped by. Behind him, the Crimson Snake camp had erupted into chaos as half of the camp rushed toward him, and the other half tried to put out the burning siege weapons.The pursuers raced after him as fast as they could but were unable to close the distance no matter how fast they ran. Soon a strung out line of Crimson Snake soldiers trailed Thorn, trying to slow him with spells and attacks. Arrows pelted Thorn as he ran, most bouncing from his armor, spent after their long flight. Others stabbed into his back, chipping away at his health. Chanting softly, Velin rested her hand on Thorn's chest, continuously healing him even as his health drained away. Soon the citadel's wall appeared in the charging army's sight, and they noticed that Thorn sped up.\"Keep charging! We can break into the city when they open the gate!\" No one knew who yelled it first, but the cry was soon taken up by the rest of the pursuing force, and the group plunged onward toward the wall. If the gate was opened to let Thorn enter, it would never close fast enough to keep them from fighting their way in. And even if the gate was not opened, they would be able to cut Thorn down as he tried to climb the wall. Drawing their weapons, they rushed forward with abandon.Thorn started slowing down as he approached the wall. Moving as fast as he was, he thought that he could probably jump and reach the top of the wall if he kicked off of it, but he was not about to take the chance. Who knew if his foot would go right into the wall at this speed. By the time he had managed to curb his speed, the enemy army was almost right on top of him.\"Mina!\"\"On it! [Ice Wall!]\"Rising from the ground directly next to the citadel's wall, a thick wall of of ice shot upwards. Timing it so he stepped onto its rising top, Thorn launched himself upwards, grabbing onto the edge of the battlement. Below him, the ice wall shattered, unable to bear his colossal weight. Hanging by a few fingers, Thorn gritted his teeth. Lifted in his other hand, Velin was able to scramble up over the parapets and onto the wall.Thorn groaned with the effort, but by swinging himself to the side, he was able to get another hand on the wall and then pull himself up, all the while being pelted by arrows and spells. Three Dawn Walkers took over healing him from Velin, who had been healing him the entire chase. As he ducked down, below the edge of the wall, Thorn lifted his hand.\"Cut them down.\"Freemen, Dusk Walkers, and hunters alike stood from where they had crouched below the edge of the wall, lifting their bows. Arrows tipped with rags covered in pitch were raised and set aflame, bathing the wall in a blaze of light. Crying out in shock, many of the Crimson Snake soldiers started to retreat only to see the flaming arrows arching over their heads. As the flame illuminated the pass the retreating players and soldiers were startled to see that the ground was still dark. \"Pitch! There is pitch on the ground!\"\"Run!\"Pandemonium ensued as the arrows landed, igniting the ground that had been soaked in pitch. The fire spread quickly, helped by the low piles of brush that had been scattered across the entrance to the pass. As the flames grew, they rapidly spread across the entrance, creating a solid wall of flame blocking the Crimson Snakes from their camp. Tendrils of flame reached out to caress anyone who tried to get near, and thick black smoke filled the air. Soon the flames started following the ground, approaching the high wall of the citadel.\"Fire at will!\" Captain Del'har's voice rang out over the field, followed by the hiss of arrows cutting through the air. Screams of pain rose as the enemy soldiers tried their best to defend, but with fire approaching from one side and a rain of arrows from the other, they had few options. Gazing down on the chaotic field, Thorn was surprised to see that a number of players had formed small groups and were reacting well to the situation.A few players guarded against arrows from the wall while the rest dug into the ground, trying to create a space free from pitch. Narrowing his eyes, Thorn drew his arbalest and focused, aiming carefully at one of the players who was guarding the others.\"Mina, I'm going to crack that group. Do you have range?\"\"Yes, yes I do.\" The short Witch was currently standing on a box to help her see over the wall. Waiting until Mina's chant was almost complete, Thorn took his shot. The bolt flashed through the air, smashing squarely into the shield held by the Crimson Snake player, nearly taking his arm off. Tumbling backward, he smashed into three other players who were digging as fast as they could, knocking the whole group down in a heap.\"[Blizzard!]\"Razor sharp icicles and snowflakes swirled into existence over the group of players, slowing them and cutting into their exposed skin. Taking advantage of their disarray, countless arrows showered the group, turning them into pincushions. \"Excellent, let's do that again. Captain, organize a squad to come with me and Mina and another one to help Velin. Velin, will that laser spell you have crack their defenses?\" Seeing her nod, Thorn grinned. \"How many can you shoot?\"\"I can do five before I run out of mana.\"\"That should be good enough. Try to knock out healers and any other casters. Mina, we're going to be moving up and down the wall, so jump up.\"\"Whoo hoo!\" Excited, Mina clambered up onto Thorn's broad shoulder, holding on as he made his way down the wall toward the next group of players. Between the attacks of the Night Walker groups on the siege equipment while he was talking to Ouroboros and the trap that they had set up here, he was hoping to slow Ragnarok down for another day. Yet, despite how well both plans had gone, Thorn could not shake the feeling that tomorrow would be a bloody day. \"Let's focus on one thing at a time.\" As if sensing his distraction, Mina patted Thorn on his head, bringing him back to the present. \"We need to cut down as many of the players as possible before they realize that they can retreat through the wall of flame.\"\"Yes, ma'am.\" Giving a sloppy salute, Thorn raised his arbalest as Mina's chanting filled his ears.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Did you know that Book #2 and Book #3 are already finished?

Come explore the world of Nova Terra and help me determine where the story goes.You can find out more about me at www.sethring.com", "Dawn rose over Moon Wolf Citadel, the clouds painted a bloody red. The night had been long, and the light revealed how much damage had truly been done. His face impassive, Thorn stared out over the scorched field that lay in front of the citadel wall. According to the scouts, the Crimson Snake camp was in shambles after the night time raid. Between the trap in front of the citadel wall and the chaos caused by the Night Walkers, the enemy had been reduced from 1700 down to 1100, with over 600 enemy soldiers falling.The trap had taken down just over four hundred and fifty soldiers who had died to arrows and spells. But the truly surprising thing had been the devastation caused by the Night Walkers, who had claimed a full one hundred and fifty enemies through assassination during the chaos. Confused about how they had been so effective, Thorn had talked to Elder Havva, who had showed him the poisoned dagger that all the Night Walkers used. A simple cut was enough to drop a player, especially when left untreated, and ingesting the poison only made it work faster. The Night Walkers had slipped through the crowds, ambushing players they found alone and wounding as many as they could. By the time that they were discovered, it was too late to save most of their victims, and they slipped away into the darkness.While the night had gone as well as Thorn could have hoped, he was still concerned. He had a nagging feeling that something was going to happen today. The Crimson Snake camp was still there, and the ringing of axes floating from the forest sounded the preamble to a bloody day of fighting. The sound had not stopped since the night before, and siege towers were starting to rise at the edge of the pass.\"I guess we know what Ouroboros' answer is,\" Thorn remarked to no one in particular.\"Was that ever in any question?\"Hearing Velin's voice, Thorn glanced at her before turning back to watch the Crimson Snakes hurrying around.\"No, I don't think it was. He made it pretty clear where his priorities lie. And they are not with us.\"\"They are not with Ragnarok either. Which is why he stood by while Angdrin lost. This is the curse of power. Once you have it, you have to keep it. And to keep it, you have to get more of it.\" Velin sighed, pushing a wisp of hair out of her face. \"He was not always like this, you know.\" \"No?\"\"No. He used to be quite gentle. But between the pressure from his family and a few key disappointments, he grew cold. Hard. He raised walls around his heart and learned to manipulate others into doing what he wants.\" Velin shivered, remembering Ouroboros' magnetic voice from the night before. \"It seems like his class has just added to his abilities. Be careful of him, Thorn. He gives me a really dangerous feeling.\"\"Yeah, me too. And it is highly likely that we have used up any possible goodwill that he had toward us last night.\" With a shrug, Thorn straightened up and stretched. \"Time to eat some breakfast. I have a feeling we'll need quite a lot of energy today.\"It was almost ten in the morning by the time the remnants of the Crimson Snake army marched on the pass again, this time with Ouroboros at their head. He had not bothered with a helmet this time and had replaced the Crimson Snake flags with his own Blood Guard flags. Of the remaining 1100 soldiers, two hundred of them were members of the Blood Guard, forming the most elite group in the army.Dragging four hastily constructed siege towers with them, they stopped outside of arrow range. On the wall, Thorn, Mina and Velin stood with Captain Del'har, Elder Havva, and Horvir, the leader of the Freemen. \"This is going to be tough.\" Thorn pointed toward the siege towers. \"The last attack was anger driven, without thought or plan. In fact, it is highly likely Ouroboros instigated it in order to get rid of Angdrin. Our raid last night went really well, but we've only cleared the chaff. The true elite core of the enemy force is still there. Our advantages remain what they were previously, but those siege towers will be a problem. \"Thankfully, they were put together pretty quickly, so they should not be that sturdy. Let's focus our attention on destroying them as fast as possible. Captain, we need four teams to target the towers. Please organize those. You'll be leading one and Mina, Velin, and I will each lead another. Elder Havva, we will be committing our whole force to this battle. Please organize the remaining disciples that have not yet participated in two groups. I'd like to deploy them in the towers on the front wall to provide help clearing the wall should the enemy make it up.\"Our strategy will be fairly simple: do our best to ensure that the enemy does not get a solid foothold on the wall and delay. I don't have any illusion that we will be able to win a direct fight against their forces, so we should avoid direct combat as much as possible. However, if we can delay until this afternoon, we should be able to pull out the victory.\"\"We have reinforcements coming!\" Mina's brow had been furrowed, showing how much effort she was putting into thinking about Thorn's words. As realization dawned, her face lit up with a smile, and she shouted, as if she had discovered the greatest secret in the world. Seeing her so pleased with herself, the rest of the group burst into laughter.\"Correct, Oberlin is on his way.\" When the laughter had subsided, Thorn continued. \"Alright, everyone has their orders. Let's take our positions. Horvir, please stay, I have a couple things I want to talk to you about.\"\"Yes, my lord.\" The leader of the Freemen saluted as the others split up to take their positions on the wall.After a hushed conversation with Horvir, Thorn took his place on the wall with the others. Just like the day before, the Freemen were spread along the wall in teams of four with hunters standing by to help. Today the disciples of the Temple of the Moon had also been deployed, hiding behind the large wooden shields. \"Steady!\" Captain Del'har's voice rang out across the wall as the siege towers began to rumble forward. Unlike the mad rush of the last attack, the enemy army moved slowly forward. The first two rows of the army held shields in front of them, trying to provide the army with some cover against the waves of arrows that were sure to come. Behind them, the siege towers were being pushed toward the wall. Due to their hurried construction, the towers were simply frames with three sides covered, leaving the back completely open. Each stood thirty five feet tall, ten feet higher than the wall, and contained a drawbridge opening on the top. Built almost entirely of wood, the towers were effectively a one use item, but, should the attack succeed in breaching the wall, that would be enough.\"Steady!\" Still, the captain did not give the order to fire, his eyes locked on the advancing troops. While the enemy had entered into the maximum range of the Freemen longbows, the arrows would be spent by the time they had traveled that far and would deal little damage to the shield-wielding soldiers.Time seemed to slow and crawl by at an agonizingly slow rate. Despite the day being cool, Thorn felt a bead of sweat roll down his cheek. Unblinkingly he kept his eyes on Ouroboros' dark-armored figure at the back of the enemy force.Across the field, Ouroboros frowned. He had been hoping to waste some of his opponent's arrows by baiting them into attacking his shield warriors, but they had not fallen for it. It would seem that the mysterious Lord Greymane had a competent military commander.\"Tell the vanguard to advance at normal speed. Our goal is to breach the wall as soon as possible, so hold nothing back.\"\"About time.\" The leader of the Blood Guard, a heavily scarred half-orc nodded, bloodlust rising in his eyes. \"Advance! For Ragnarok!\"\"For Ragnarok!\" The shout echoed out over the pass, and the whole army accelerated abruptly, sweeping across the field. \"Steady! Steady... Fire!\" At the captain's command, hundreds of arrows arced over the battlefield. Immediately after the first arrow, the archers reached down, taking a second arrow and sending it flying at the enemy. Sacrificing accuracy for volume, the defenders rained arrows down on the battlefield as fast as possible.Thorn watched the enemy streaming toward the wall, a slight smile curling the corner of his lips. The arrows were not dealing much damage to the advancing soldiers, but really, that was not their true purpose. Thorn's slight smile blossomed into a grin.The soldiers at the front of the the charging army lifted their shields to ward off the falling arrows as they sprinted forward. In the real world, charging like this in full armor was a death sentence, as they would be too tired at the end of the charge to fight, but in Nova Terra, their armor weighed almost nothing, enabling them to quickly cover long distances and still operate at full fighting capacity.Running forward at full speed, the first few soldiers felt something strange under their feet but were moving too quickly to shout a warning. With an echoing crack, a long  trench, jaggedly cut, appeared underneath their feet, sending them plunging down into the earth. The soldiers behind them tried to stop as well, or tried to jump over the pit, throwing their lines into disarray.\"Focus on the shields!\" Captain Del'har shouted, directing the archers to target the shield warriors trying to cross the wide pits. Thorn had spent much of last night after the army's retreat quietly digging out a trench that spanned the width of the battlefield. Due to his strength and endless stamina, Thorn could move earth better than an army of diggers, and it had only taken him six hours to riddle the battlefield with traps.The Dusk Walkers and hunters from Greymane Village had showed him how to stretch thin cloth over the trenches and scatter dirt and ash over them to make them blend in to the burnt ground. As soon as any significant weight was applied to them, the cloth would collapse, sending the person who stepped on it tumbling into the pit.If he had the time, Thorn wanted to add spikes or something dangerous like that, but he had barely been able to finish before the plain began to grow light, so he had to put that part of the plan aside. Still, he felt quite proud when he saw the enemy army falling into the deep trench. Six feet wide and eight feet deep, the trench zig-zagged this way and that, making it extremely difficult to determine where it began and where it ended.The Crimson Snake army slowed to a crawl, the momentum of their charge stopped by the deep trench. While many of the soldiers who fell into the pit lost a good amount of health, few actually died in the trap, and soon a ragged line of shields formed on the far side of the trench, trying to block the arrows streaking in from the wall. With the added layer of protection, more and more soldiers climbed their way over the pit.  Almost one hundred shield warriors had fallen to arrows as they tried to climb out of the trench, but once the shield wall was re-established, the number of casualties began to fall. On the wall, Mina glowered. The trench had been her idea, and she had hoped that it would take more enemies out.\"It was well worth it.\" Thorn was all smiles. \"The first trench will slow them down, the second will slow them down even more. Both were great ideas. Remember, our goal is not to kill them all, we just need to slow them down.\"\"Killing them all would slow them down.\" Mina glared at the enemy army, her voice heavy.Thorn looked at Velin, slightly concerned. The elf, catching his gaze, nodded and stepped forward, putting her arm around Mina's shoulders. Giving her a squeeze, Velin pulled her away.\"Let's get ready for the fight. They will be here sooner than you think.\"On the battlefield, the shield warriors had begun to push ahead again to make room for the rest of the army. Walking instead of running, they tested the ground for more traps, making detours around them when they were discovered. The large siege towers stopped before they reached the trench, pausing while soldiers began to collapse the sides of the trench to create a large bridge for the towers to be pushed over.The ringing of axes echoed across the battlefield again, and the bridge was soon reinforced by newly cut trees. Balancing the towers precariously on the bridge, they were pulled over. Spreading out again, the towers resumed their advance, pushing toward the citadel.Ahead of them, curses began to ring out, mixed with laughter from the wall. Only fifty feet from the wall, the shield warriors had discovered another deep trench, though this one was a bit different. Rather than dropping straight down, this trench featured a long sloped side that dropped more than ten feet down into the earth, ending abruptly with a ten foot wall of dirt. Just short enough that the tower's exits were too high to be easy to use, the wall of dirt would require the ladders to climb. However, if the ladders were being used to climb up the wall of the trench, they could not be used for climbing up the citadel's wall until the whole army finished getting over the trench. On top of that, the endless rain of arrows had not let up for even a moment, and once they were within fifty feet of the wall, the shorter distance would make the arrows all the more dangerous. Not to mention, the whole army had heard about the magic wielded by Mina and Velin the night before, and fifty feet was perfect range for the Ice Witch and War Priestess' spells. Looking at each other in frustration, none of the officers wanted to be the one to order their forces to breach the dirt wall. Without a doubt, the group that did would get obliterated.\"Let our glorious leader decide.\" A grizzled looking native officer spat on the ground. Already upset by how many of his men had fallen, he had no interest in sending the rest to their death. Nodding, the others agreed and sent a soldier to call Ouroboros up to the front.A few moments later, staring at the newly discovered obstacle, Ouroboros began to swear.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Did you know that Book #2 and Book #3 are already finished?

Come explore the world of Nova Terra and help me determine where the story goes.You can find out more about me at www.sethring.com", "Without any other good option, the Crimson Snake army got to work trying to breach the dirt wall. Due to the height, Ouroboros commanded his army to focus on a single section, cutting into the dirt wall so that it would collapse. Packing the fallen dirt down, they dug into it again. As they repeatedly dug into the wall, a path began to emerge for the siege towers.At the same time, a section of warriors was sent to each side of the battlefield, using the ladders to climb up in a bid to distract the defenders. The shield warriors, who had born the brunt of the arrows as the army approached the citadel, had been greatly thinned out and the other soldiers quickly found themselves at the mercy of the archers on the wall.Mina, running back and forth on the wall, dropped ice storms on the attackers trying to climb up the ladders. The swirling ice and snow slowed them down as they tried to organize a defense, making them easy targets for the archers on the wall. Standing in the center of the wall, above the gate, Thorn and Velin quietly discussed what to do about the siege towers. Between fifty and sixty feet away, the path that was currently being opened for the siege towers would be finished within the hour, at which point the superior combat ability of Ragnarok's forces would begin to take effect.Without the wall to keep them away, Thorn knew that his forces would not last long. If they wanted to win this fight, they would need to keep Ragnarok at a distance, which meant finding a way to destroy the siege towers. \"What do you think?\"\"We need to destroy at least three of them.\" Velin scribbled furiously in her notebook, calculating the odds of success. \"I would say that if we can destroy all of them, Ragnarok's chances of victory fall to below twenty percent.\"\"Still that high? What about if we don't destroy them?\"\"One hundred percent. If we take out three of the siege towers, their chances of victory should be at around sixty percent.\"\"What makes you so confident in their success?\" Thorn asked, curious.\"Ouroboros has not pulled back.\" Velin sighed, putting away her notebook. \"He is a cautious general and must have something that is giving him confidence. He would not stick around for this fight if he did not have a backup plan. But without an idea of what that backup plan is, we can only push forward and try to draw it out.\"\"Then we better start. Fancy helping me start some fires?\" Thorn smiled and patted a barrel next to him. Ten barrels lined up under the edge of the wall, dark, pungent smelling tar oozing from their tops. Thorn lifted the first barrel, carefully aiming at the closest siege tower. Drawing his arm back, he breathed out, steading his nerves. More than anything, this would determine their victory or defeat.Offering a little prayer to Hati, Thorn hurled the first barrel. Turning over lazily in the air as it flew across the battlefield, the barrel fell slightly short. Whether from excitement or nervousness, he had not put quite enough power into the throw, and with a crack, the barrel landed on the edge of the dirt wall, spraying the ground that enemy soldiers were trying to smooth out.\"Close. Let's try that again,\" Thorn muttered to himself as he hefted the second barrel. The next throw hit the tower squarely, coating the side of the tower in thick pitch. \"Haha, that's what I'm talking about!\" With four towers to take down, Thorn's goal was to hit each tower with two barrels. However, reality was not so kind and, despite the initial success of his second throw, Thorn was only able to hit three of the towers. Vowing to himself to practice throwing in the future, Thorn stepped back with a sigh, motioning to Velin that the stage was set for her.The War Priestess moved forward to the wall, lifting her staff up above her head. Muttering under her breath, Velin focused her attention on the three towers that had been covered in pitch. The Crimson Snake soldiers were trying to spread the towers out again, but it was proving difficult, since they had to move them one at a time. As they pushed and struggled, a clear voice rang out from the wall.\"[Flame Storm!]\"Horrified, the soldiers scattered, running from the towers as fast as their legs would take them. Instinctively, they knew what the target of the incoming spell was, and none of them wanted to bear its wrath. Above the middle tower, the clouds gathered into a vortex, spinning into a fearsome thunderstorm.Yet instead of rain, large fireballs began to fall, impacting the tower and everything within forty feet of it. Smashing into the ground, the fireballs ignited the pitch, causing pitch-covered towers to erupt into hellish infernos, burning so hot that the wood glowed white. With a series of bangs, the towers burst apart as the abrupt change in temperature caused the sap in the freshly cut wood to boil and expand rapidly.\"Oh, wow.\" Thorn stared, wide-eyed at the mass destruction caused by Velin's spell. Throwing a quick glance at her, he noticed that her face had become paler than normal. Concerned, he stepped forward and took her trembling hand. \"Are you alright?\"\"Yes.\" Velin took deep, calming breaths. \"I just overdrew my mana. I'll be fine in a couple minutes. But I probably will not be able to cast another [Fire Storm] for a few days.\"\"Not a problem.\" Glancing at the inferno burning in the middle of the path that the Crimson Snakes had been carving through the dirt wall, Thorn smiled. \"One looks like it is going to be enough. We are in really good shape.\"*ding*\"Haha, speaking of angels.\" Thorn was so happy he almost started dancing in place. \"Mina, get over here! Captain! Get ready to give the signal.\" Snapping out orders, Thorn supported Velin to the edge of the wall.Below them, the battlefield was in utter chaos. Thick plumes of smoke rose from the burning towers, forming a haze over the whole field. Along the edges of the battlefield, the Crimson Snake soldiers struggled to climb the ladders and attack the wall under the endless torrent of arrows from the defenders.Behind the burning towers, Ouroboros stood in front of his private soldiers, a strangely still island amid the chaos. Considering what sorts of countermeasures would allow them to breach the wall now that the path to the wall had been blocked, Ouroboros could only curse under his breath. \"Sound the retreat.\" The Exalted Devil Blood Berserker's voice was hard enough to sever iron.Taking a horn from his hip, one of the Blood Guard blew three short blasts, signaling the end of the battle. Relieved soldiers streamed back, away from the wall, desperate to get out of arrow range. Watching his forces pull back like a tide, Ouroboros' jaw tightened under his helmet.\"We regroup at the camp. As soon as the fires burn down, we assault again. This time, we'll take the vanguard.\" Sending a final cold glare at the figures on the wall, Ouroboros turned to go back to the camp when screams began to ring out.The Crimson Snake soldiers had retreated as fast as they could back to the camp where they had collapsed on the ground. The assault had not gone well, and those of them that had made it back were exhausted, physically and mentally. Yet their dreams of a rest were not to be. Just as they made it back to their camp and sat down, two groups charged out and began to slaughter them.From the forests an army of almost two hundred charged out, cutting down anyone unfortunate enough to be in their path. Leading the charge were a hundred Wolfkin, who sprinted forward in heavy armor. Crashing through the Crimson Snake soldiers, they opened the path for an even more brilliant group of fighters who followed right behind. As the attackers reached the center of the camp, a dazzling figure flew over the heads of the charging Wolfkin Full Moon Walkers. Landing with a crash, a ring of blue flame burst out from the figure, cutting through the nearby enemies.\"Roses, charge!\"Under the cold eyes of the Full Moon Walkers, part of the force behind them suddenly accelerated, overtaking them in an instant. Sixty players pounced on the Crimson Snake army, wreaking havoc on an untold scale. A mystical light swirled around each of the women, connecting them together and giving them an ethereal air. Each had unique equipment and weapons, yet their movements were strangely coordinated, allowing them to cut down their enemies with ease. Within minutes, the camp had been completely decimated as the Society of Roses killed off the remaining soldiers. \"Keep moving, ladies.\" The Queen of Roses strode through the camp, wisps of light tying her to all of the other Society of Roses. \"We're not done yet.\" Above her head the flowing light solidified into a blooming rose.Ouroboros, reading a message sent from one of the players at the camp that had just been destroyed, paled.\"Why are they here?\" Unable to stop himself from losing his cool, Ouroboros shut his eyes, calming himself down.Hearing their normally unflappable leader mumble to himself, the Blood Guards looked at each other, concerned. With a deep breath, Ouroboros turned to look at the citadel. \"Well, gentlemen. It looks like it is time to attack.\" Ouroboros' voice was cold and bleak, yet the magnetic charm still ran under the surface, convincing those who heard it of the rightness of his words. \"We have a seemingly impenetrable fortress before us, and certain death behind. I don't know about you, but I'd like to kill some people before I die, so we're going after the fortress.\"\"Sir, what...\" One of the Blood Guards pointed at the camp that had just fallen silent.\"The Society of Roses are here.\" Ouroboros cut him off, keeping his eyes fixed on the figure standing above the gate. Despite the distance, Ouroboros felt like he could see the giant's calm face.\"Society of Roses? Sir, there are two hundred of us. We should be able to defeat them.\"\"All of them. They are all here. Not a squad, not a group of them. All of them are here.\" Ouroboros pointed toward the blooming rose appearing above the smoking camp. \"The only way to survive this is through the fortress.\"\"Oh...\" The Blood Guard fell silent and then turned resolutely toward the Moon Wolf Citadel.\"Let's go.\" Not bothering to try and help the struggling remnants of the Crimson Snake forces, Ouroboros led his Blood Guard toward the citadel, even as the Society of Roses and Full Moon Walkers closed in from behind.Standing in the gatehouse, Thorn watched the approaching force, his eyes lighting up as he spotted Ouroboros' black-armored figure. Next to him, Mina was pestering him with questions.\"Who is attacking Ragnarok? Where did you find players crazy enough to do that? Are these the reinforcements you talked about? Wow, check out those fireworks. Hey, is that...?\" Trailing off in shock, Mina pointed a trembling finger at the decimated Crimson Snake camp where an ethereal rose had bloomed. Next to her, Velin nodded, her heart beating wildly. \"AHHH! You know the Society of Roses!\"\"Hmm? Yeah, I guess.\" His eyes fixed on Ouroboros, Thorn was having a lot of trouble keeping himself from jumping from the wall to attack. Holding tightly to the battlements, he breathed deeply, driving down the burning excitement in his chest that had grown almost unbearable.\"You guess? What do you mean, you guess?!\" Mina was hopping up and down in excitement. \"That is the whole guild, too! Do you know how hard it is to get the whole guild to move? AHHH!\"\"Mhhmm.\" Thorn was barely registering her voice at this point. It wasn't until he heard a crack that he realized he had manifested his claws, leaving thick gouges in the stone wall he had been gripping. *ding* The quest served as the final push, and without another thought, Thorn leapt the battlements. Startled by his sudden move, Mina and Velin dashed forward, their hands resting on the wall as they watched him jump down from it. With a massive boom, Thorn landed on the battlefield, sending a cloud of dirt and ash billowing. With a wave of his hand, his massive metal spike appeared in his hand, leveled at the approaching Blood Guard.Climbing over the wall of dirt, Ouroboros stopped in front of the gate, staring at the silver giant who stood in his way. Behind him, the Blood Guard gathered, spreading out into a half circle to surround Thorn.\"You've lost, Ouroboros.\" There was no gloating in Thorn's voice, just calm finality.\"Not quite yet.\" Ouroboros' voice was also calm. \"There is one chance left.\" Striding forward until he was within twenty feet of Thorn, Ouroboros pulled a large, double-handed sword from his back, sinking it into the ground in front of him. Hanging his helmet on the pommel of the sword, he flashed a winning smile at Thorn.\"I must admit, it never crossed my mind that there would be a wall here. When I found out that Angdrin had discovered the location of a new spawn point for Wolfkin, I could not help but be tempted to seize it.\" Slowly removing his gauntlets as he spoke, Ouroboros hung them on his belt. \"When Karrandras whispered to me that this was a chance to control the Wolfkin race, how could I resist? But imagine my surprise when I arrive to find the valley that should have been open for plucking was hidden behind a giant fortress.\"And, only serving to deepen my surprise, who do I find guarding the fortress but my former companions? Poetic in a way. I used you and threw you away, yet you persist in a futile effort to stand in my way. I must admit, your spirit is commendable. Your spirit will not, however, help you here. Regardless of your struggle, as heroic as it might be, the valley will be mine. Not only will the valley be mine, but this fortress will be mine, and the Wolfkin will be mine.\"Before Thorn could react, Ouroboros pulled a dagger from his belt, slashing open his palm.\"[Exalted Devil's Contract of Blood].\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Did you know that Book #2 and Book #3 are already finished?

Gathering together, the blood began to sway, as if it were burning. With a flash of red light, the blood collapsed, revealing a shining parchment hanging in the air in front of Ouroboros. Spidery writing filled the parchment, yet when Thorn looked at it, he was unable to see what it said because the words seemed to skitter to the edge of his vision. The feeling that the parchment gave Thorn was one of deep evil, sending a shiver down his spine.\"I, Ouroboros, initiate the sacred trial of combat under witness of the supreme contract.\" Under Thorn's gaze, the cut on Ouroboros' hand healed as he reached toward the floating contract. \"Under the ancient laws, this trial of combat shall be carried out without interference from any third party. The penalty for interference is death.\" Ouroboros' words manifested themselves in blood red letters as he spoke, hanging in the air threateningly. \"The wager shall be the life of the loser and free passage into the valley for the winner, without any interference from a third party. The stage shall be this battlefield. The weapons shall be the armaments of the participants.\" The words hanging in the air pulsed and separated, copying themselves. Shivering, they flew through the air, stopping in front of Thorn, as if to give him a chance to read them. As he began to look over them, the world seemed to freeze for Thorn, and the words morphed, turning into crimson chains that seeped into his body.*ding* A cursed contract that could not be avoided. Thorn was almost upset by how game breaking this ability seemed, yet when he thought about his abilities, he could not find it in himself to be perturbed. As one of the very few four category class holders, it made sense that Ouroboros would have incredibly powerful abilities.His mind working furiously, Thorn examined the details of the contract. Its basic form was simple, a trial of combat, like the one he had faced in the Wolfkin village. With two participants, the trial would end when one of them died. Technically, they could surrender, but since the loser would die, it was effectively the same. The prize of the trial of combat was simple, safe passage into and around the valley. That section was a bit confusing because of all of the detailed terms, but as far as Thorn could understand, players would not be able to attack the winner of the trial in the pass or valley while their opponent was dead. This sort of immunity was very powerful as it would allow Ouroboros to escape from being surrounded and killed by Thorn's reinforcements.Despite knowing that Ouroboros would be locked out of Nova Terra for 48 hours if he lost the fight due to the double penalty, Thorn wasn't satisfied. Ouroboros had achieved his current abilities by stepping on Thorn, and being kicked out of the game for two days simply was not enough for Thorn's tastes. Making his decision, Thorn blinked, the world around him resuming its normal flow of time. Smiling grimly, Thorn stepped forward.\"By my rights under the ancient law, I, as the challenged, wager more than my life and safe passage. I, Lord Greymane, the Moon Wolf, wager my title, my possessions, my land. Winner takes all.\"Thorn's deep voice had no problem carrying over the battlefield, eliciting gasps from those on the wall. Looking up at Thorn's wide smile, Ouroboros paused, his mind racing.\"Why bother with such a lame bet? If we are going to throw down, why not make it worth it? What do you think, Ouroboros? If you win, you can get everything. The valley, the citadel, even the allegiance of the Wolfkin. All you have to do is walk over me again.\" Spreading his arms, as if to take in everything around him, Thorn took another step forward. \"Why are you hesitating? Don't you have the confidence to grab what you want here? All you have to do is beat me.\"Behind the Blood Guard, a flickering, ethereal rose approached swiftly. As the flower apparition came closer, the heavily armored guards shifted, facing outwards, their fidgeting revealing their nervousness. Rushing over to the wall, the Society of Roses stopped, and their leader stepped forward, her sword raised. Just about to order the attack, she paused, as if she was reading something.\"Stand down, ladies. No fight quite yet.\" Her brow furrowed, Julia turned her eyes on Ouroboros and Thorn. After a brief consideration, she ordered her troops to move to the gate and strode forward, pushing past the Blood Guard who hesitated as if they did not know whether to try and stop her.\"Get out of the way.\" Her voice was ice cold, sending shivers down the spine of the Blood Guard in her way. For the briefest of moments it seemed as if the Blood Guard would not move, and blood would be spilled, the air growing even tenser. \"Let them through.\" Looking gratefully at their commander, who ordered them to step aside, the Blood Guard stepped back, letting the Society of Roses pass by Ouroboros and Thorn and walk to the gate. Everyone who had entered the area had been notified that a trial by combat was about to take place, and the commander of the Blood Guard saw no reason to fight until it was resolved. Besides, while the commander was confident in the group of players he had trained, he had no desire to face up against thirty of the best PvP combatants in the game.Walking past Thorn, a few of the Society of Roses smiled and waved, greeting Thorn. The rest looked at him with unabashed curiosity, whispering to each other. Hearing the giggles and seeing the pointing fingers, Thorn shuddered internally. Only Julia stopped next to Thorn, bumping fists with him, the gentle tink of their gauntlets ringing across the battlefield. At the sound, Ouroboros' pupils shrank, and his smile faded. The motion was such a simple action, yet somehow it managed to convey the depth of the relationship between Thorn and Athena, the Queen of Roses. As the sound echoed in their ears, the Blood Guard trembled, and Ouroboros sighed, knowing that he had gotten himself into serious trouble.He had assumed that Thorn, though giant, was simply a player when his investigation into Thorn's background had not revealed anything. Yet now the Society of Roses had committed themselves fully to the fight, and it was obvious that Athena had a close relationship to Thorn. Cursing mentally, Ouroboros could not believe that his investigation had missed that piece of information. While Ragnarok was one of the top guilds in the game, no one wanted a piece of the Society of Roses. The elders of Ragnarok had warned him numerous times not to get on Athena's bad side, not that he would have challenged her anyways. Suddenly, Ouroboros' breath caught in his throat as he stared at Thorn. He knew who Athena was in the real world, which was why Ragnarok did its best to stay out of her way, and seeing her bump fists with Thorn triggered a memory in his head.\"Come, Ouroboros. You challenged me, I set the wager. That is all there is to it. There is nothing to consider as the trial of combat has been set.\" The giant stepped forward, the force of his presence commanding all of the attention on the battlefield. \"Let us begin.\"\"You are Xavier Lee.\" Ouroboros spoke numbly, his voice was quiet but certain. His posture sagged slightly as he looked down at the ground. \"You are Julia Lee's nephew, the owner of Atlas.\"Silence fell over the battlefield as every one of the Blood Guard froze, any remaining fighting spirit draining from them.  \"So? Right now, I'm just Thorn. Let the real world stay in the real world, and Nova Terra stay in Nova Terra.\"At Thorn's words, Ouroboros' gaze, which had been directed at the ground, snapped up, his eyes searching Thorn's face. Seeing no deceit, the black-armored warrior shook his head in disbelief.\"I don't know if you are heroic or simply foolish, but I agree. I'll accept your terms.\" As his words faded, Ouroboros slipped his hands back into his gauntlets and picked up his helmet. \"The contract is established.\"*ding* His chest burning with excitement, Thorn summoned his claws, flexing his hands as the silver light condensed around the end of his fingers. Gripping his large metal weapon, Thorn dropped into his stance, taking in his opponent's every movement. While he had never fought against Ouroboros, he had watched the former Holy Guardian carve his way through countless mobs, and he knew how skilled his opponent was.Ouroboros had traded his shield in for a much larger, two-handed sword that he wore across his back. He had retained his full suit of plate armor, but the style had changed from that of a paladin to something sleeker with spikes on the shoulders. Ouroboros fixed his helmet in place and pulled his sword from the ground in one swift motion, leveling it at Thorn.\"Come, let's settle this.\"\"Haha, that is my line.\" Thorn wasted no time in dashing forward, his mace swinging through the air.Avoiding the strike with a neat dash to the side, Ouroboros returned a slash of his own, his sword cutting toward Thorn's side. Blocking with his club, Thorn stepped back, creating a bit of distance. Normally, both fighters would want to be at an arm's reach to give them room to swing their weapons, but with Thorn's larger size, distance benefited him more.For a tense few minutes they traded blows, testing each other with probing strikes. Thorn's attention focused on his defense, his attacks quick, meant to try and poke out Ouroboros' weakness. Ouroboros did the same, never quite committing fully to any of his strikes. Back and forth they pushed, their weapons dancing.Cutting at Thorn's feet with his blade, Ouroboros suddenly accelerated, putting his full weight behind his attack. Sensing the danger, Thorn jumped back, throwing out an overhead strike. Before his attack could hit, Ouroboros sidestepped and slashed up with his sword.\"[Blood Strike!]\" As his sword swung toward Thorn's stomach, blood seeped from between the plates in Ouroboros' gauntlet. Joining together, the blood congregated on the handle of his sword and shot up the blade, staining the edge with a crimson glow. The tip of the sword clashed against Thorn's armor, scattering sparks into the air. With a roar, Ouroboros stepped forward as soon as his blade made contact, trying to stab it into Thorn's stomach.Grunting at the impact, Thorn found himself staggering backwards as the blood infused attack drilled into him. Gritting his teeth, he shifted his body to the side, and smashed down with a palm attack, hoping to break the blade by trapping it between his palm and body. As if he had a sixth sense, Ouroboros jumped back as soon as he saw Thorn's body start to shift, quickly getting out of Thorn's reach. Separating, neither warrior moved forward to re-engage. Instead, Thorn took a small step back, his hand pressed to his stomach. Silence had fallen over the battlefield, and when the ringing sounds of their combat died down, all that could be heard was Thorn's labored breath.\"Whew. This might be harder than I thought,\" Thorn murmured, gulping in air. He could feel the spot that Ouroboros' sword had stabbed into his side, and while it had not managed to pierce through, the strike had deformed his armor quite badly. No doubt he would have a significant bruise. Twisting his body a bit to make sure there was no impairment to his movement, Thorn glanced down to see what damage had been done.\"Your defeat is inevitable, Thorn. Why bother with this useless struggle?\" The hypnotic undertones of Ouroboros' words slid through the air, poking at the edges of Thorn's will.\"Haha, you mistake what I am saying, Ouroboros.\" Thorn looked up from inspecting his side, his eyes glowing with excitement. \"I'm pleased that I will not be able to flatten you with a single strike. You must understand how frustrating it is to rarely have a solid fight. But here you are, presenting yourself to me.\" Thorn stepped forward, his aura deepening as he did so, his words taking on a slightly hoarse tone. \"Thank you for offering yourself up!\"\"[Wolf Lord's Howl!]\" As Thorn threw back his head and howled, sound waves pulsed from him, covering the battlefield. For the briefest of seconds, Velin, watching from the wall, felt like she could see them spreading out from Thorn. The sound battered against Ouroboros, ringing in his head as the long howl grew in volume. Distracted by the ever increasing waves of sound, it was as if he was being tossed around without knowing which way was up. Ouroboros shook his head and focused his attention on feeling his surroundings. The dirt and ash of the battlefield under his feet, the firm handle of his sword. With a low shout, he broke free of the stunning effect of Thorn's ability and looked up, just in time to see Thorn's mace flying toward his chest.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Did you know that Book #2 and Book #3 are already finished?

It did not take a genius to know it was pure suicide to try and block one of Thorn's full-powered strikes, so his only option was to dodge. Tumbling, Ouroboros did a backwards roll, coming to rest in a crouch, his sword held in front of him.Thorn, unperturbed by his missed attack, shortened his grip and swung his mace around his head, maintaining the momentum of his strike. Bringing it down with increased force, he smashed it into the ground where Ouroboros had rested a moment before, blasting a crater in the already mangled battlefield. With a roar, he launched his mace sideways, hoping to catch Ouroboros before he could regain his balance.Feeling the mace slide over his head with millimeters to spare, Ouroboros broke out in a cold sweat. If any of the whistling swings were to connect, he knew with certainty that he would not survive. Gritting his teeth under his helmet, grateful that his armor hid how difficult he was finding the fight already, Ouroboros activated one of his skills. In a flash of dark power, his armor blurred and he appeared twenty feet away.\"What was that?\"Mina asked Velin, who stood at her side, their eyes locked on the fight taking place in front of the gate.\"Looks like Power Charge, or something similar. Probably a corrupted version of it. Possibly with an evasion effect? The Holy Guardian Power Charge skill had a micro-invulnerability effect, but evasion would make more sense considering the devil aspect of his new class.\"\"With a quad category class, how many skills does he have? I don't think this is going to go well.\" \"Don't give up hope yet.\" Velin put her arm around Mina's shoulders, pulling her in close. \"Remember the greater werewolf in Greymane Keep? Thorn is just getting started.\"Down below, Thorn had stopped his attacks and turned to face Ouroboros.\"Running away? Not what I expected from a berserker.\" His tone faintly mocking, Thorn pointed his weapon at Ouroboros. \"Why don't you show me that power that was worth betraying me for. Or is this all you have?\"\"You want to see my power? Alright, I'll show it to you. [Blood Rage].\"*CRACK*With a sharp sound, the plates on Ouroboros' smooth black armor shattered, revealing crimson cracks that oozed blood. Like veins pumping blood, the red lines pulsed with a demonic glow, as if Ouroboros had stepped straight out of the underworld. A disgusting, bloody stench drifted from him, spreading out over the battlefield, causing those caught in its carrion embrace to feel nauseous. Feeling the familiar disgust welling up in him, Thorn's eyes narrowed. He had fought the Wolfkin Disciple corrupted by Karrandras in the Wolfkin village, but this feeling was on another level. Ouroboros' corruption was so complete that, for a moment, Thorn felt like he was in the presence of the Arch Devil himself.\"You wanted to see how powerful I have become, right?\" Ouroboros' voice dripped with the promise of power, his calming words at odds with the murderous vibes radiating from his bloody figure. \"[Blood Strike!]\"His armor pulsing with blood red light, Ouroboros dashed forward. The red light from his body streamed across the edge of his sword, granting it a barbaric aura. Rather than try and dodge the attack, Thorn stepped forward, smashing out with an attack of his own, determined to beat Ouroboros in a contest of strength. *BOOM*With a thunderous sound, the weapons met, sending sparks flying. Without pausing for even a moment, the two warriors threw out another strike, their weapons smashing into each other again. With each earthshaking swing, they clashed, sending out shockwaves that sent ash and dust into the air, blurring their figures. Just as they were completely hidden by the cloud of debris, Ouroboros roared out.\"[Blood Splits the Earth!]\"Under the horrified gaze of the defenders, Thorn's massive body flew backwards out of the cloud of ash and dust, the force of Ouroboros' strike blasting away the flying dust. Tucking his body, Thorn rolled over on the ground, coming to a stop on one knee. A bloody mark crossed his chest where the attack had connected, the crimson red blood showing in stark contrast to his dark armor.In front of the gate, Athena took a step forward, the murderous aura that had been growing around her suddenly spiking out of control. Just as she was about to act, Bluefire grabbed her arm, stopping her in place.\"Don't. You can't interfere. Besides, even if you could, he doesn't need help yet.\" The Society of Roses officer pointed her tonfa at Thorn, who had already started to move.Before he had come to rest, Thorn was already changing directions. Sliding backwards on one knee, Thorn planted his right foot and launched himself back into the fight. Strength surged through his leg, propelling him through the air toward Ouroboros, who had given chase. With a low roar, Thorn unleashed his massive strength in a full powered strike, his massive metal mace ripping through the air with a piercing whine. \"[Blood Strike!]\" Meeting the attack with a full powered strike of his own, Ouroboros tried to match Thorn with force. As their weapons collided, it was Ouroboros' turn to go flying. The power behind Thorn's attack was simply too much to overcome, and Ouroboros could only deal with the remaining force by throwing himself backwards. Despite his attempt to neutralize the power of the strike, Ouroboros struggled to maintain his balance as he flew through the air, staggering as he landed.Charging forward, Thorn roared, his eyes turning red as his [Wolf's Rage] activated, granting Thorn a boost in his speed and strength. The increase in Thorn's speed was abrupt and terrifying, carrying him right up to Ouroboros. Still off balance, Ouroboros barely had time to get his weapon up when another brutal strike from Thorn landed on his side, sending him tumbling head over heels. Relentless, Thorn chased after him, forcing Ouroboros to use another of his skills.\"[Blood Break!]\" Still in mid air, Ouroboros forcefully righted himself, a blood red ring bursting from him. The ring expanded, bouncing Thorn backwards, allowing Ouroboros a precious second to land on the ground and stabilize himself. But a second was all he got before Thorn was back on top of him, his mace swinging.Watching Thorn rampage like an unstoppable beast, murmurs arose among the Blood Guard. They had never seen their leader so hard pressed before. His quad category class put him in an elite tier matched by only a few players, and his skill in combat was among the best in the game. Yet Thorn seemed to bat him around like a rag-doll. \"What is going on? Is the commander going to lose?\" one of the Blood Guard asked the player next to him, clenching his fists. Unable to muster up a response, his companion just shook his head mutely as again and again Ouroboros was driven back by Thorn's powerful strikes. Cheering broke out along the wall as the defenders watched their lord battling the enemy commander. Only Velin was silent, her face grave.Noticing that the elven War Priestess was not cheering with the rest of them, Mina frowned, her enthusiasm dampening. It only took her a moment to see what was causing Velin such concern, and when she spotted it, her mood fell even further.Ouroboros was being tossed around the battlefield, looking for all the world like he was seriously struggling against Thorn's massive strength, but both Mina and Velin could tell that appearances were deceiving. Having spent countless hours fighting alongside him, they understood how accomplished Ouroboros was at tanking, and they could see him putting those skills into practice against Thorn. The angle of his blade, they way he moved around Thorn, the timing of his dodges, and his counter-attacks all worked in concert to create a rhythm that ensured he took the minimum amount of damage while expending as much of Thorn's strength as possible.Already, Thorn's boosting ability, [Wolf's Rage] was starting to wane, and his attacks were starting to slow down. It was here that Ouroboros' experience began to shine. Slowly, despite the fact that he was being knocked around, Ouroboros was taking control of the fight's rhythm. As Ouroboros dodged a strike for the fourth time, Thorn realized that he was slowly being drawn into repeating patterns.Exhaling, Thorn jumped backwards suddenly, causing Ouroboros to start to charge forward after him. As if he sensed the impromptu trap, the black-armored warrior suddenly stopped and stepped backwards. \"You are really good.\" Thorn shook his head, resting his mace on the ground as he caught his breath. \"Most enemies would have been crushed into pulp by now. I'll admit that you gained a lot from your choice to stab me in the back and steal my destiny points for a quad class. But I feel like the weakest part of you is these crappy blood abilities. When we go head to head, you lose every time. If you were not such a good tank, you would have died already. That means that you don't need Karrandras or this quad class to be strong, Ouroboros.\"\"Shut up.\" Ouroboros' voice had taken on a raspy quality ever since he activated his [Blood Rage] ability. The grating sound did nothing to remove the hypnotic element in his voice and even served to enhance it. Thorn was quite thankful that his [Oration Proficiency] ability helped him resist his enemy's verbal bewitchment. Without it, he was not sure that he could have resisted falling prey to Ouroboros' lulling words.The bloody smell had faded from the battlefield, a sure sign that Ouroboros' rage ability had run out of time. Unlike [Wolf's Rage], the [Blood Rage] ability had an infinite duration so long as the player who used it killed other players or natives, making it ideal for a messy group fight. Unable to show off its strengths against a hard to kill enemy like Thorn, Ouroboros found himself running out of juice with nothing to show for it. The blood veins in his armor continued to pulse, but each second the glow faded.\"You do not get to judge me,\" Ouroboros said, his voice carrying despite how quiet he was. \"You have no idea what sort of power I've gained. You think that you understand? You understand nothing. Blood Guard, sacrifice!\" Ouroboros' voice grew in volume until his last words thundered across the battlefield, echoing from the citadel's walls.Without hesitating, the Blood Guards each pulled out a long, wickedly curved, forked dagger. Turning, they stabbed them into their companion's bodies under the shocked gazes of all of the defenders. Too late Athena realized what was happening and, unable to stop it, she could only watch as gouts of blood streamed from the grimacing Blood Guard players. Each wicked blade, enchanted with a bleeding effect, caused blood to splash to the ash covered ground, pooling under the feet of the Blood Guard. One by one, the player's lives drained and they disappeared into sparks of light. Within moments, all two hundred players had been sent out of the game, leaving a massive pool of blood running in rivulets across the battle-scarred ground.\"You wanted to see my power? The power of Karrandras? Let me show you what real power looks like, Thorn.\"As if drawn by a magnet, the blood began to ripple, moving toward Ouroboros' feet. Defying gravity, it poured toward him at increasing speed, bringing with it the ash and dirt of the battlefield. Swirling around underneath his feet, the blood seeped into his armor's cracks, climbing the blood veins and bringing with it a fresh crimson glow. The bloody scent that had faded returned suddenly and in full force, cloying the air with a disgusting stench.More and more blood rushed over, getting so high that the swirling maelstrom at his feet soon reached his knees. Faster and faster the blood was sucked up by his broken armor, as if it was drinking from the life essence of the sacrificed. At first Thorn was not sure if it was a trick of his eyes, but he imagined that the blood pumping into Ouroboros was causing him to swell. Soon, however, he knew it was not a trick of the fading daylight as Ouroboros suddenly grew three inches all at once.The bloody glow running in veins around Ouroboros' armor had been growing and expanding, and with an abrupt cracking noise, the veins expanded, causing Ouroboros to grow larger and larger. The more blood he absorbed, the bigger he got, until he was standing a full foot taller than Thorn's 8 feet 9 inches. Ouroboros presented a truly frightening picture, his hulking form dripping with the glowing blood that he had absorbed.His armor, once smooth and sleek, was now comprised of cracked and broken plates floating in a sea of blood, causing him to appear to be a giant elemental made of blood. Gone were any human features, and instead long, jagged blood blades grew from his arms. A bloody tail tipped with a wicked looking barb formed from a piece of broken armor swiped from side to side behind him, seeking an opportunity to draw Thorn's blood. As the last vestiges of the pool of blood were drawn into Ouroboros' armor, it revealed his legs, reformed into the legs of a goat, only adding to his new, devilish look. \"Well? What do you think?\" Obvious pride could be heard in Ouroboros' voice as he stepped forward, showing off his devil form fully. \"The power granted to me by Karrandras is the greatest this game has ever seen. With this [Blood Devil] form, there is nothing, player or native, that can stand against me. With it I will crush everything and everyone in my way, starting with you. Thorn, you are powerful, but against a true devil, you can do nothing. Give up. This fight is hopeless. Give up and you can join me. You can gain power like this. Power to stand alone atop the world.\"For the briefest of moments, Thorn's eyes wavered, dropping to the ground at the giant devil's feet. The words of Ouroboros ate away at his mental defenses, urging him to give up, to lay down his weapon. Then Thorn's eyes snapped back up, cutting through the bewitching air that Ouroboros' words had woven.\"I don't need your power.\" Thorn mumbled, his burning eyes fixed on Ouroboros' bloody figure. \"I have plenty.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Did you know that Book #2 and Book #3 are already finished?

The fact that he could still think at all was due to his unnatural resistance to mental effects, granted by his both his race and class. A quick glance back toward the wall showed that the others were not so lucky. The greater devil's form carried a natural suppressive force that pulled those who encountered it into a passive state, making them unable to resist.Thorn could feel that suppressive force clearly, and if he could not figure out a way to break it, he knew that it would only be a matter of time until he too fell into a stupor. His wounds seemed to respond to the aura, and the blood that had been trickling from them increased, winding its way in thin streams toward Ouroboros' grotesque figure. Even gathering his thoughts was growing harder by the second, so Thorn decided to stop thinking. \"[Rallying Cry!]\" A long howl poured from Thorn's throat, echoing around the pass, the eerie tones bouncing from the stone of the citadel and reflecting from the Twins. On and on the call went, powered by Thorn's seemingly endless breath. Elder Havva was the first to respond from where he stood, slumped over on the wall. Unconsciously, he struggled to straighten and, with a shuddering breath, lifted his head and joined in the long howl. Slowly, the other Dawn Walkers joined in, throwing back their heads to howl along with Thorn.At first, the call was scattered, disorganized. Yet as it continued, it grew in strength and intensity, the varied voices combining into a single harmonious voice. As more and more Wolfkin joined in, the corrupting power of Karrandras began to collapse, eroding at the edges. The bloody scent that had dominated the battlefield began to clear, and those who had fallen under the natural stupor effect of the greater devil began to awaken.\"What? Impossible!\" Ouroboros growled, droplets of acidic blood flying from his slavering maw as he spoke. Hate grew in his eyes as he stared at Thorn. All of his troubles stemmed from this giant figure in front of him, blocking his path. Determined to remove Thorn once and for all, he strode forward, lifting the blades on his arms to strike.With a roar, the greater devil slashed at Thorn, intent on cutting him down where he stood. Thorn, seeing the blow approach, cut off his howl, sliding back on his feet and dropping naturally into his taijiquan stance. It felt like it had been a lifetime since he had used the martial arts that he had learned before coming into Nova Terra. His training had been largely useless due to the size difference between him and most enemies.The greater devil form that Ouroboros had revealed was just as big as he was, making it a perfect target for him. Seeing another strike coming in, Thorn shifted his stance by sliding his foot back, moving just outside the range of the attack. Ouroboros, growing increasingly furious that he had missed both his attacks, rushed forward, his devil's tail stabbing forward. Thorn lifted his hands, holding his mace like a broadsword, deflecting against the barb on the end of the whipping tail, and bringing his feet together smoothly, stabbing forward with the end of the mace. Taken aback by the smoothness of Thorn's transition from defense to offense, Ouroboros was unable to react in time and took the main force of the blow, staggering backwards. With a ferocious roar, the greater devil surged forward again.  \"Your puny attacks cannot stop me, Thorn! This form is invincible!\" Raving, Ouroboros rained down attacks on Thorn, slashing and gouging with the blades on his arms while his tail whipped this way and that, seeking every opportunity to stab forward.Weathering the storm of attacks, Thorn felt as if he was a boat being tossed in a gale, threading through the waves and wind, ever in danger of capsizing, but somehow staying upright. At first his reactions were slightly jerky as his body tried to remember the forms and paths from his training. Despite the bloody gashes that began to appear on his body, Thorn persisted, emptying his mind of all distracting thoughts and focusing on the enemy in front of him.Slowly, his moves began to become smoother, his reactions slightly faster. The transitions between his deflecting moves and his attacking strikes began to blur until they merged together, forming a weaving net of intermixed offense and defense with no distinction. Ouroboros could feel control of the fight slipping from his clawed fingers as Thorn's moves became smoother and smoother. Furious, he redoubled his efforts, striking with as much power as he could muster, yet his attacks were deflected to the side or redirected into empty space, wasting his strength. Each time he swung his blade Thorn seemed to be just out of reach, moving outside the range of motion of his attack. Just as he was about to explode with fury, Thorn's smooth, slippery motions suddenly changed, and Ouroboros barely registered a silver blur before something hit him in the ribs, hard. *CRACK*With a sound so sharp it cut straight through the air, Thorn's mace impacted the greater devil's side, crushing the remnants of armor that floated in the bloody plasma that made up its body, sending it plunging to the ground. Thorn had let himself go, clearing his mind to focus on the fight and allowing his muscle memory to guide him as he fought. Slowly, the years of training that he had drilled in before coming to Nova Terra had been unearthed, allowing him to keep himself from being overrun by Ouroboros' greater devil form. As his movements had grown more natural, they had begun to unconsciously merge with the tetsubo training that Master Sun had put him through in the gorge of the earth elementals, combining defense and offense into one smooth action.As he deflected the last attack, Thorn had instinctively felt an opening in his opponent's defenses, and without hesitation, he had stepped forward, planting his feet solidly as he struck out, smashing his mace into the greater devil's ribs, driving it into the ground. As soon as he connected, Thorn could tell through the feedback of his weapon that he had dealt significant damage. Flipping the giant metal spike around, Thorn stabbed the pointed end down, putting his full weight behind the blow. The sharp spike pierced through Ouroboros, pinning him firmly to the ground, and eliciting a shriek of pain from the greater devil. His arms flailing, Ouroboros struggled to free himself, only to feel a massive weight clamp down on his body, forcing him farther into the ground.Thorn, loath to give up the advantage he had seized, dropped a knee onto Ouroboros' chest, pinning one of the greater devil's arms to the ground with his other leg. The dwarven trainer from Berum's words echoed in his head, and he began to throw fist after rock hard fist down at the greater devil's head, battering it into an unrecognizable shape.Each furious hit smashed into Ouroboros, sending blood flying, yet the greater devil simply regenerated, his head reforming after each strike. The whipping tail plunged toward Thorn's back, stabbing into his shoulder. Roaring with pain, Thorn grabbed the spiked end of Ouroboros' tail and, with a furious pull, ripped the talon right off, plunging it into the neck of the greater devil.Ouroboros' scream of pain turned into a gurgle as the barb pierced through his throat, and for the first time, he began to know fear. His furious attempts to dislodge Thorn from on top of him gained an edge of hysteria, yet no matter how he struggled, he could not move the figure on top of him. Thorn's weight was like a mountain, sealing him to the ground. Again and again, Thorn smashed down, his strikes getting faster and faster, raining down blow after blow on the greater devil. The burning ember of fury that Thorn had been suppressing for so long suddenly burst forth, igniting into a raging flame. Ever since the events in the dungeon, Thorn had been doing his best to keep a tight lid on his feelings, but now the dam had broken. All of the frustration and anger Thorn had bottled up inside poured out in a storm of strikes, imbuing his rock hard fists with even more power than normal.Watching from near the wall, her eyes wide, Athena turned to look at Bluefire \"Don't look at me. I didn't teach him that.\" The Society of Roses fighter shook her head and held up her hands. \"I thought you said that he had a peaceful childhood? That doesn't look very peaceful to me.\"\"I...\" Unsure what to say, Athena fell silent, watching as Thorn pummeled the greater devil into a pulp.Soon the angry bellows of the greater devil were silenced, and the body below Thorn evaporated into shining particles of light. Utterly drained, he knelt on the battlefield, too tired to even move. As he gulped in air, he could hear Mina's screams of excitement approaching. A warm golden light fell on him, removing the weariness from his limbs, healing his wounds.*ding*   Thorn's jaw nearly hit the floor when he looked at the rewards for defeating Ouroboros. He had expected to be rewarded well considering that he had bet practically everything he owned, but four items, four abilities, and four resources were out of his expectation. Especially when he started looking at their details.First were the three pieces of named armor that Ouroboros had dropped. Each piece was part of the smooth black armor set that Ouroboros had been wearing. Never having seen a named item in his time playing Nova Terra, Thorn was curious as to what advantage they would have.   Immediately, Thorn could see how important having a named armor set was. Just the double increase in constitution that came with wearing four pieces was enough to give a player a huge advantage, to say nothing of the full six piece set bonus. Curious about the other two bonus abilities that the set gave, Thorn opened them up. The [Devilish Aura] added a fear effect to the player's aura, while the [Summon Helfiend] could actually summon lesser Helfiends to the battlefield. Thankfully for Thorn, both only activated after killing an enemy, making them useless in the one on one fight that between Ouroboros and Thorn.While the set would not fit him, Thorn instantly thought of his follower, Captain Del'har. Remembering the Wolfkin Captain's lightning fast sword draw at the Wolfkin camp, Thorn could only imagine how strong the captain would be while using a set of named armor like this.The other item that Ouroboros dropped was a simple, golden token. Rectangular in shape, the token was embossed with a castle and seven stars arranged in a half circle. The token was four inches tall, three inches wide and less than an inch thick. Despite its small size, Thorn found it surprisingly heavy, as if the game's automatic weight reduction did not work on it. The description for the token was brief, but Thorn could immediately see the immense value it held. In his study about the game, he had come to realize that the natives saw themselves as different from the immortal travelers who came from another world. This manifested itself in numerous ways, but one of the most obvious was the difficulty that players faced when trying to gain noble positions or raise their noble rank. Ouroboros must have planned to use this token to bypass that restriction.His brow furrowing slightly, Thorn skipped over the abilities that he had gained and looked at the [Legacy Deeds] in the resource portion of the reward. As soon as he read through them, a clear picture of what Ouroboros had intended emerged, causing Thorn to chuckle. It was obvious how much effort Ouroboros had put into this plan, only to have Thorn benefit.   Just like the [Nobility Upgrade Token] that Ouroboros had dropped, the four [Legacy Deed] papers that Thorn received would grant him official status in the eyes of the empire. Should Ouroboros have been able to control the valley, he could have applied for official noble status and then used the four [Legacy Deeds] and the [Nobility Upgrade Token] to instantly elevate his rank.Yet now, all his hard work had come to naught, and instead it was Thorn who was benefiting. With a sigh, Thorn could only shake his head and wonder if the game had planned this.\u00a0-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Did you know that Book #2 and Book #3 are already finished?

The first was a non-combat ability that seemed like it was tied to Ouroboros' devil class. Curious about how he would know that this sort of ability was active, Thorn made a mental note to ask Velin. Many of his abilities, like the language proficiency that he had picked up, simply worked unconsciously, but he was not sure if this was the same. The last three abilities were fairly straightforward, so after looking over them, he closed the windows and stood up. \"Thorn!\" Running over, Athena was smiling and shouting, ecstatic that Thorn had won. Behind her, streaming from the fortress, Mina and Velin led the Wolfkin and human residents of the valley, everyone cheering loudly.\"Whew.\" Thorn breathed out, the tension from the fight draining from him. \"It was a close thing, huh?\"[Master, master! That was amazing! You totally beat up that evil blood giant guy!] In a streak of red, Akira zipped past Thorn's aunt and climbed up Thorn's bent and scratched armor, jumping around excitedly on his shoulder. [But next time why don't you bring me? I could have helped you, and we would have smashed his smelly face into the ground!]\"Thanks, Akira. Next time I will, okay? Thanks for cheering for me.\" Rising to his feet, Thorn removed his helmet and greeted the cheering crowd, holding up his hand for silence. It took a few minutes before everyone calmed down, but once they had, Thorn's deep voice carried over the battlefield. \"Friends, we've won.\" An explosion of cheers erupted from those gathered, forcing Thorn to wait until they quieted.\"Our valley is safe, thanks to your efforts. Yet now is not the time to relax our guard. Very soon we will see an influx of new Wolfkin arriving in the valley. With them come opportunities and challenges. We have much to do before they arrive, and I will need your continued dedication and hard work if we are to grow and improve our land. We have a battlefield to clean up, supplies to restock, building to do, and some rules to organize. Tonight, however, we feast! In honor of our first victory together, let us celebrate by eating and drinking to our hearts content!\"Gesturing for Captain Del'har to lead the cheering masses back into Moon Wolf Citadel to get ready for the celebration, Thorn turned to his aunt. Canceling his armor, Thorn enveloped her in a big hug.\"Thanks for coming,\" Thorn whispered, gratitude heavy in his voice. While the Society of Roses had not fought all that much, their arrival had forced Ouroboros into a dead end.\"Of course, kid. Wouldn't miss it for the world.\" Athena patted him on the shoulder. \"Though, judging from that last fight, I don't know that you actually needed any help. You've gotten quite impressive, Xavier. Quite impressive indeed.\"\"Thorn! You...\" Mina was so excited she was breathless.\"Congratulations on your victory, Thorn.\" Placing a hand on Mina's shoulder, Velin smiled. \"That was an impressive display of combat.\"\"Seriously, are you sure that you are not actually a native boss?\" Oberlin's voice cut in. Grinning, the thief appeared from among the Society of Roses who had crowded around. \"Haha, hey boss. That was something else.\"\"Thank you, everyone.\" Thorn smiled, a slight blush creeping up his cheeks. After he had greeted Bluefire and the rest of the Society of Roses, Thorn invited them all into the citadel's fortress where Captain Del'har and Elder Havva were waiting. Massive tables had been laid out in the entrance to the fortress, and many of the valley's residents were running back and forth, piling up food on them. Two huge barrels of wine were rolled out and tapped, and the smell of roasted meat soon rose into the evening sky.While the food was not fancy, it was hearty and plentiful and, above all, delicious. Thorn, famished from his fight, swept an entire table clean by himself, to the utter astonishment of his subjects. His aunt, used to his eating habits, kept up a steady stream of conversation with the others at the table, entertaining them with stories and funny anecdotes while her nephew polished off two whole roast boars, countless pieces of bread, a whole bucket of mashed potatoes, and a massive amount of fruit.When she had first met Velin and Mina, Athena had been rather cold, but after talking with them for a bit, she gradually warmed up. Despite Thorn's assurances that his relationship with the girls had been repaired, Athena was skeptical until she saw it with her own eyes. When he had finally eaten his fill, Thorn leaned back in his chair with a satisfied sigh. The tables were cleared, and most of the residents had turned in for the night in preparation for the work that had to be completed over the next week. Noticing that Mina had a sliver of worry in her eyes and was not her normal, excited self, Thorn asked her what was wrong.\"Ah, it is nothing.\" Mina smiled stiffly, waving her hands.  \"I'm really happy about our victory.\"\"She is probably worried about what is going to happen when Ragnarok comes back.\" Sitting next to Mina, Velin played with the stem of her wine glass. \"Even with the Society of Roses here, Ragnarok has a lot of people.\"\"Oh, that's right. I completely forgot.\" Thorn tossed one of the nuts he had been snacking on at Oberlin to get his attention. \"Hey, do you have that thing I asked you to get?\"\"If, by 'thing' you mean the territory appointment, yes.\" Rubbing his head with one hand while he got a stack of papers out of his inventory with the other, Oberlin wondered why the peanut had hurt so much. \"Here you go. Just needs your signature to be official.\"\"Excellent, thanks.\" As Thorn got a pen from his inventory and signed and initialed the papers, Mina crawled over the table to look at the top sheet. Laughing, Thorn pushed the papers to her while he explained to the rest of the table that was looking on with interest. \"Before we came to the valley, I sent Oberlin down south to act as a guide for the Society of Roses. However, he also had another job.\"\"This is an enfeoffment!\" Few things could shake Velin's calm, but when Mina, unable to make heads or tails of the paper, handed it to her, her eyes widened in shock.\"That is correct. The Wolfkin and other inhabitants of this valley have officially applied to be members of the Northern Empire. They have recognized the title of Lord Greymane and granted the holder the rank of Baron, with control over the valley. We'll be paying taxes to the Ironhold Duke who oversees this duchy.\"\"Wait a second. You are a baron?\" Mina was skeptical.\"Yup.\" Grinning, Thorn shared the notification that had just popped up for him. \"Wait a moment, you did not have the title yet when you sent Oberlin to the capital. How did he apply for citizenship?\" Velin pointed out the hole in Thorn's explanation.\"Haha, let's just say I'm a very talented individual.\" Oberlin grinned smugly from his seat.\"Ah. I see.\" Velin nodded.\"I don't see,\" Mina exclaimed, her pouting expression causing everyone around the table to laugh.\"He probably wrote the documents before Thorn arrived here. By the time Thorn cleared Greymane Keep, the documents he forged were no longer forgeries, which allowed Oberlin to file them immediately after getting them checked.\"\"Exactly.\" Thorn nodded, taking over the explanation from Velin. \"At the end of the day, the empire wants taxes, and so long as we pay them, they are not too concerned with a small baronage. We agreed to pay a higher than normal tax rate for the first two years as well as a special tax to the Ironhold Duke. While the empire is not concerned with us, our new position means that a player guild like Ragnarok will have to be cautious about attacking us, since we are vassals of the Ironhold Duke, and any challenge to us is a challenge to him.\"\"Leave contacting Ragnarok to me.\" Sitting next to Thorn, Athena looked up from feeding tidbits of fruit to Akira. \"I'll let them know what the situation is and negotiate a settlement.\"\"I don't mind handling it.\"\"No, I insist.\" Athena smiled, though her eyes carried a particular chill. \"You focus on what you are good at, like punching people. Let me take care of the things I am good at.\"\"Like taking a layer of skin off business rivals at the negotiation table,\" cackled Bluefire from the other side of the table before ducking a piece of fruit that Athena threw across the table.\"Just trust me, Thorn, I'll handle it appropriately.\" Athena shot a warning glance at her chuckling guild mates. \"Thank you, Aunt. I know you'll do a great job.\" The look in his eyes was soft and full of love as he watched Athena fool around. She had always taken wonderful care of him, and it seemed that nothing had changed now that they were in this new world. Standing to his feet, Thorn looked around at the gathered players and natives. He could read many thoughts and feelings in their faces. Some looked to him for security and stability, some looked to him with their ambition. A few even looked at him with a burning flame in their eyes that he could not quite place. Regardless, their eyes were fixed on him, and for the first time in his life, it was not because of his abnormal size.\"Thank you all for celebrating this victory with me. We have much to do in the coming days, so I want to thank you now for all of your hard work. A few things to note. Per our agreement with the Society of Roses, a branch of their guild will be established here as a mark of the alliance between Nova Luna and the Society of Roses. Additionally, Elder Havva has agreed to open up the Temple of the Moon to those who want to walk the path of the disciple. He will be responsible for overseeing the temple and the training of new disciples. We expect a pretty large influx of new players.\"Velin has been tasked with negotiating with the merchants who are interested in establishing themselves in Moon Wolf Citadel, so if you hear anyone asking around, please refer them to her. Diplomatic questions go to Oberlin, who will be assisted by the disciples of the Dawn Court. He will be handling our representation as part of the Ironhold Duchy. Mina has kindly agreed to work with Horvir and the Freemen to explore the surrounding mountains and categorize all of the different resources the valley possesses. She will also help train our soldiers and will be assuming command of the magical combat squad we hope to build.\"If you have questions or concerns regarding security, please see Captain Del'har. For any guild business regarding Nova Luna, please come and see me. We will be opening up guild membership to players and natives alike, and the ladies of the Society of Roses have agreed to assist us in setting up the guild structure and helping us process applicants. I know you all probably have a lot of questions, but it has been a long day. Tomorrow morning we will have a meeting at eight o'clock. You can raise your questions then.\"As he finished, Captain Del'har and Horvir, the leader of the Freemen, both stood to salute. Quickly following them, Velin rose to her feet. Oberlin joined the Elven War Priestess in giving Thorn a half bow. Mina, seeing the others do it, bounced up as well. Taken aback, Thorn looked around in surprise as those around the table stood and bowed to him. Unsure how he was supposed to respond, he fumbled around for a moment until he felt a pinch at his side. Looking down, he saw his aunt poking him.\"Stand up straight, Baron Thorn. They are simply giving you the respect you are due,\" she whispered, fighting to keep the smile off her face. After everyone else had gone to bed or logged out, Thorn climbed to the top of the fortress and walked out on the protruding wolf head, sitting on the nose as he watched the water running from the mouth fall, unbroken, down to the pool below. The stars had come out in full effect, and gazing across the dark valley brought peace to Thorn's heart. The last couple months had been full of ups and downs, full of pain, betrayal, and suffering. But for the first time in his life, he didn't feel trapped in his own skin. He felt free.Tomorrow, more people would come and more problems would have to be addressed. Conflict loomed on the horizon, and Thorn knew without a doubt that it would dominate the coming years. Others would come to this place and try to take this land from him. And beyond the mountains that ringed the forest before him were countless other mysteries and problems waiting to seize his life. Yet for all that, for the first time ever, true contentment reigned in his heart.Here, now, in this quiet, peaceful moment, he was free.-----------------------------------------------Book #2 End", "Hi everyone! Seth here with an update on what to expect from this story going forward.Whew! Book #2 was a ride, wasn't it? I started posting Book #1 of Nova Terra just over a year ago, and in a flash we are already at the end of Book #2. Thank you all for your support and encouragement over this past year. It has meant a lot to me.I've had a couple questions regarding Book #3 and I wanted to give you all an update so that you know what to expect. Good News: I will be posting Book #3 (Nova Terra: Kingbreaker) on Wattpad!Less Good News: It will not be this week. Make sure to give me a follow so you get notified when the chapters start back up. I hope that it will be soon.The reason that I have been able to write as much as I have is due to the unbelievable support I have received from my patrons. Over the last year the community around Nova Terra has grown from 0 to over 400 patrons, which has been an uplifting and humbling experience. Not only have we created a world together, but we've even had some art commissioned (with plenty more in the works) and we have developed some extra content that is exclusive to Patreon.This has also made it possible to pursue things like audio book development (more on that coming at another date) and some speaking engagements based around Nova Terra. Needless to say, the community on Patreon has added a lot of critical depth and richness to these stories.. In order to make sure that I am properly rewarding my patrons, I maintain a bit of a buffer between when content comes out on Patreon and when it goes public, which is why there will be a slight delay.If you are interested in reading ahead, or want to help shape the future of Nova Terra (we're already into Book #4 on Patreon!!!) I'd invite you to check out: .Interested in seeing some of what we've been doing? Check out these sketches of Thorn! ", "Growing up as the wealthiest child in the world, Thorn had seen his share of ornate buildings. And yet, standing in the entryway to the Palace of the Shining Sun, his breath caught in his chest. The huge, gold covered double doors had promised ostentation from a distance, but they proved unable to adequately prepare Thorn for what lay beyond them in the entry hall.Stopping dead in the middle of the doorway at the sight of the hall that stretched out for the next half a mile, Thorn's sudden pause blocked the trickle of people trying to enter behind him. A foppishly dressed gentleman started to make a snide comment to his companion only to swallow it when his companion silently pointed to Thorn's 8' 9\" figure dominating the doorway.Paying no attention to the grumbling of the nobles behind him, Thorn only snapped out of his stunned wonder when he felt a sharp pinch at his waist. Looking down in time to catch Mina rolling her eyes, he simply smiled and resumed examining the gold plated reliefs that covered the twenty-foot walls. Each wall showed part of the glorious history of the ancient empire of Angoril, stretching back to the time before the continent split in half.Above them, delicately painted murals depicted the pantheon of the gods and the dragons that came after them. While the gods were portrayed as relatively benign, Thorn was unsurprised to see the dragons depicted as greedy and cruel despots. As they neared the other end of the hall, the mural changed as humans began to emerge, fighting the dragons. A human woman was pictured alongside a male Demonkin, leading them in driving all of the dragons back into the earth. Eventually, the humans triumphed and established the empire of Angoril. At the very end of the mural, a human figure sat on a large, golden throne, a crown on his head. Having arrived at the other end of the long hall, Thorn made a mental note to talk to Velin about what exactly had happened to the empire. As far as he knew the first emperor had been a half Demonkin, half human that married a human queen and that their children had split the continent into the northern human empire and the southern demonkin empire. With each successive emperor being either more Demonkin or more human, and this led to mistrust and civil war. It was not until they came to an uneasy truce that the situation stabilized. Yet the mural depicted the first emperor as a human.\"Thorn, quit spacing out!\" Mina's concerned voice drifted through his thoughts, bringing him back to the present. \"You look dumber than a doofus about to put his finger in an electrical socket!\"\"Hmm? What's up?\"\"We're about to meet one of the three ministers! You need to pay attention when you talk to him. The nobles are all about following protocol, and if you don't pay attention you might get into trouble.\"\"Right. I'm paying attention.\" Thorn smoothed a wrinkle from his shirt, catching sight of his smartly dressed form in the polished gold wall. When he had arrived at the human capital a few weeks ago, his aunt had rushed him to a well-known tailor to make a suit of court clothes. Despite feeling slightly foolish dressing up, he had to admit that the tailor had done quite well in dressing his massive form in the span of a night. Thorn would rather have worn his armor, but apparently, that would be a massive faux pas. The nobles of the human empire took their clothing very seriously. Sighing to himself, Thorn took comfort in the fact that he would not be here long. A month ago, Ouroboros had led an army against Moon Wolf Citadel, finally falling before its gate in single combat against Thorn. When Ouroboros died, Thorn recovered a [Nobility Upgrade Token] from his body that would allow him to increase his noble rank by a single level along with four legacy deeds that granted control of imperial property. Accompanied by Mina, Oberlin, and his aunt's mercenary corps, Thorn had made his way to the capital of the human empire, leaving Velin back in the valley to take care of their fledgling guild. Athena had matters of her own to handle while Oberlin soon disappeared to work on some project, leaving Mina and Thorn to try and navigate the confusing bureaucracy.The city itself was magnificent, built upon an island suspended in the air by powerful magic. Runes, thrumming with power, carved intricate paths along the gargantuan stone base of the city, holding it steady a hundred feet above a glistening lake. Water continually poured from the four gates of the city, thundering down into the lake below, creating an everlasting mist that shrouded the city in rainbows.Standing on a curious half boat, half pagoda, Thorn and his friends rose through the air to the edge of the city, entering through a large gate. It was obvious that Thorn was the only one who had never experienced this before, and everyone found great amusement in his wide-eyed staring.Progress had not been smooth, however, and after arriving at the floating city, they had done little besides wait. Though he expected some level of bureaucracy since it was the capital city of the human empire, he had to admit the endless forms and waiting rooms were really starting to grate on his nerves. Athena, Thorn's aunt, had warned him to be prepared for some opposition from the other nobles, but so far it seemed as if the gears were just moving slowly.Finally, they had been granted an audience with the Interior Minister, thus the reason for Thorn's new wardrobe. After passing through the grand entrance of the imperial palace, they were directed by a guard through the winding gardens to a three-story building where the Interior Minister held his offices. At first, Thorn had assumed that his business would be handled at the Empire's administrative center in the city, but upon seeing the token that he presented, the clerks had referred him to the offices of the Interior Minister. Thankful that everything in the palace was built on a grand scale, Thorn was happy that he did not have to duck as he entered the Minister's offices. Sadly, that scale did not extend to the furniture, so Thorn stood in the waiting room as the flustered secretary ran to tell the Minister that he had arrived. \"This should be it, right?\" Mina was taking the wait even worse than Thorn, a fact she made no pains to hide.\"In theory.\" Thorn's deep voice easily filled the room, even when he tried to speak quietly. \"The clerks at the administrative office said we have to talk to Sir Trishem, the Minister of the Interior, to redeem the legacy deeds. Hopefully, he can handle the token as well.\"\"If he can't handle it, does that mean that we are going to have to wait another week?\"\"Who knows? Honestly, I'm not sure I understand this whole nobility thing anyway.\"Hearing the door open, Mina and Thorn both looked over, seeing the secretary had returned.\"Please follow me. His Excellency will see you now.\"Following her through a winding hallway and up a flight of stairs to the second floor, they entered a wood-paneled office dominated by a large set of bookshelves and a massive map of the northern empire. In the center of the room stood a small desk piled high with papers and ledgers. Numerous clerks entered and exited the room through two doors in the back, dropping off stacks of unsigned paper and taking signed stacks with them as they left. Sitting at the table, half-moon spectacles perched on his nose, Sir Trishem scanned and signed papers with uncanny speed.No one paid attention to the secretary as she entered but Thorn was too large to miss, and at the sight of him walking through the double doors the clerks faltered and stared. The abrupt cessation of movement caused silence to fall over the room, and Sir Trishem looked up. Pushing his half-glasses up on his nose, he examined Thorn's massive form. At a wave of his hand, the clerks exited the room and the secretary closed the double doors, leaving Thorn and Mina alone with Sir Trishem.\"They told me you were large, but I was not prepared for how large you actually are.\" Sir Trishem adjusted his glasses as he examined Thorn. \"Some sort of barbarian blood, no doubt. Mmhmm. I would invite you to sit, but we don't have time for that. As busy as I am, I've carved out ten minutes for you, after that you will have to leave since I have much yet to do today. My clerk tells me that you have an inheritance token?\"\"Yes, sir.\" At first, Thorn was taken aback by the Minister's brusk way of speaking, but a quick glance at the piles of paper on his desk showed that he was not just being rude. Stepping forward and carefully placing the [Nobility Upgrade Token] and the four legacy deeds down, Thorn stepped back to his former position to avoid looming over the seated minister.\"Mmhmm. It has been some time since I have seen one of these.\" Picking the token up, Sir Trishem examined it closely. \"See here, this shows that it is from one of the first mintings. A total of one hundred of these tokens were created in batches of ten. I would guess that this is from the second or third batch. Most likely when the empire was fighting against the Orcs of the southern deserts. All but three of them have been recovered, either here in the empire or in the cursed lands to the south. This will bring the count down to two tokens left.\"And I see that you have the accompanying deeds. Well, you certainly hit the jackpot, didn't you? My records indicate that you are currently a baron, which, to be frank, barely qualifies you as a noble. In fact, your rank is so low that, technically, you are not allowed to use the deeds, since that would cause you to exceed your allowable resource points.\"\"I'm sorry, I don't quite understand.\" Thorn's brow furrowed when he heard Sir Trishem's words.\"Ah, in the empire, every noble rank is limited in the number of resources they are allowed to possess. Every resource is worth a certain number of resource points, and the sum total of the resources attached to a noble title must be within that rank's limit, otherwise the empire will consider the noble to be rebelling. It is an antiquated method, I admit, but it is the law of the land.\"The breakdown is relatively simple to remember. A baron is entitled two total points, and every noble rank above it doubles the number before it. Hereditary titles allow for an extra two points, military ranks contribute a point per rank and being a racial representative grants a flat three. Special status can also be considered on a case by case basis depending on how helpful it may be to the empire.\"Overall, considering you are a newly appointed baron, have no military rank, but represent the Wolfkin race, you have a resource point limit of five. This creates a bit of a problem for us as the valley you are currently residing in counts as six points due to the capital improvements you have made.\"\"You mean the citadel?\"\"Correct.\" The corners of Sir Trishem's mouth curled slightly in a mocking smile, and he leaned forward, waving a paper at Thorn. \"To tell you the truth, I've already had two officially filed complaints accusing you of rebellion and demanding that you turn over control of the fortress to the empire.\"\"Oh?\" Thorn's tone was bland, yet Sir Trishem's smile abruptly fled and he sat back in his chair as Thorn's eyes met his. \"Good thing I have this [Nobility Upgrade Token], huh?\"\"While that will certainly help, the reports of treason have been filed and an investigation has already started. Consider this warning a mark of good faith, Baron.\"\"Thank you, sir. I will make a note of it. Now, I don't want to take up more of your time than necessary, so I'd like to use this token and redeem these legacy deeds, if you don't mind.\"Frowning, Sir Trishem took off his half-moon spectacles and placed them on his desk.\"Maybe I was not clear, Baron Greymane. You are in no position to be redeeming this token or the legacy deeds. Until this issue of treason is resolved, you would be well served to avoid drawing any more attention to yourself. The most I can do for you today is to begin the process of applying to have your rank upgraded. Until the charges are cleared, you will simply have to wait. Now, I must get back to my work.\"\"If that is the case, it would be best if I held onto the token and the deeds, huh?\" Stepping forward, Thorn held out his hand. \"Are you sure you don't want to leave them with me? After all, if you are convicted, you will need someone on your side, won't you? It would be wise for you to find a backer to help you weather this storm.\" \"That's alright, I think I'll manage just fine.\"Annoyance flashing in his eyes, Sir Trishem hesitated for a moment. His hand tightened around the token as he stared at Thorn, who smiled blandly back at him. Just as the tension in the room grew unbearable, the minister smiled humorlessly and handed over the [Nobility Upgrade Token] and legacy deeds.\"Do be careful, Baron. The world of nobles is not an easy one to navigate. It can be a thorny path.\" Sir Trishem's tone was decidedly less friendly.\"Haha, don't worry. I'm big enough to push my way through.\" Thorn chuckled at his own joke as he put the token and deeds in his inventory. \"Thank you for your time. Hopefully, the next time I visit, you will be able to help me.\"Obviously irritated by Thorn's choice, the minister simply waved his hand, calling in the clerks who resumed their scramble. After Thorn and Mina had left, Sir Trishem stood and walked to the window that overlooked the building's entrance. Watching Thorn's large figure leave, he scowled and spoke to a clerk standing behind him.\"Tell the captain to proceed as planned. If the good baron is not willing to take the easy route, I don't mind bringing some suffering to his life.\"\"Yes, sir. How far should he take it?\"\"Just enough to put some pressure on the baron. Let him spend a few days in jail.\"\"What should we do about the Ironhold Duke, my Lord?\"\"Hmm. If he cares to get involved, make up an excuse. I want the baron to spend at least three days in jail. It is unlikely that the duke will care about a new baron, especially one that is a traveler, but if he does for some reason, tell him that the baron is suspected of having ties to the Demonkin. After all, a greater devil was spotted at the valley.\"\"It will be as you say, sir.\" Bowing, the clerk left the office, making his way to a back room where he sat down at a table covered with runes. Using a special pen-shaped stick, he wrote a short message on the center of the table and, tapping on the runes in a particular order, watched as the words burned into ash, dispersing into the air.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Did you know that\u00a0 Book #3 is already finished?

That token is yours.\"\"Something strange is going on. There must be more to this than meets the eye.\" \"Good. Do you think he will try anything fishy? After all, the minister's office controls the appointment of nobles. What if he doesn't approve your application?\"\"That is what I find strange.\" Thorn scratched his head as he looked around. \"He did not specifically say that he would not approve the application. Instead, he just seems to be delaying things. Maybe he is trying to scare me? Speaking of...\" Thorn's voice trailed off as he caught sight of a squad of golden armored guards making their way toward him. Leading them was a smartly dressed captain with a deep-set arrogance in his walk. Fixing his eyes on Thorn, who stood head and shoulders above the crowd, his face twisted into a sneer. \"Looks like trouble is coming.\" Thorn kept his voice low.\"Hmm? Trouble? What trouble?\" Looking around in the crowd, Mina saw nothing but stomachs. \"I don't see anything.\"Cracking a grin, Thorn patted her shoulder. His eyes lost focus for a moment as he sent a quick message explaining the situation to his aunt. \"Mina, can you do me a favor? Meet up with Athena and ask to talk to the Ironhold Duke. I have a feeling I'm going to be tied up for the next couple days.\" Without waiting for the short Ice Witch to respond, Thorn strode through the crowd, a path automatically opening up as he walked. The approaching captain stopped in the middle of the road, the soldiers behind him coming to a halt. The bright sunlight gleamed from their armor, sending beams of light refracting back and forth across the square. Holding his hand up, the captain ordered Thorn to halt.\"Are you Thorn?\" The captain barked, staring imperiously at Thorn.\"Excuse me? Are you speaking to me?\"\"Are you deaf? Who else would I be speaking to?\"Now positive that the guards were here to make trouble for him, Thorn let a slow smile spread across his face. Taking a big step forward, he towered over the guard, his shadow completely blocking the sun.\"Who is asking?\"\"I am Captain Joelep Nevin, and you are suspected to be a traitor, rebelling against the empire.\" Purposefully amplifying his voice, the captain smirked as he heard the surrounding crowd break out into whispers. \"You will come with us to be interrogated, or we will take you in by force.\"\"You forget yourself, Captain. I am Baron Greymane, the Moon Wolf. Address me accordingly or suffer the consequences.\" Thorn's deep voice rumbled across the plaza, bringing pin-drop silence to the surroundings. Stopping directly in front of the captain, Thorn towered over him, casting a shadow over the whole group. His tone was light but firm, and he spoke at his own pace. \"Do you, by chance, know what the consequences are for someone who falsely accuses a noble? Especially of a crime like rebellion?\"As if by magic, a book appeared in one of Thorn's massive hands and, licking his thumb, he began to leaf through it. The only sound in the plaza was the rustling of the pages as the crowd stared with bated breath. Running his finger along a page, Thorn nodded and looked down at the captain and his squad.\"Section 12 of the rights of a noble. False accusations against a titled noble will be punished to the same degree as the crime that the accuser has leveled.\" Thorn snapped the book shut, the crisp bang causing the soldiers to jump. \"Be careful what you say, Captain. It would be a shame if you destroyed a promising career over something as foolish as a false accusation.\"\"Enough nonsense! You either come quietly, or we'll make you come!\" Captain Nevin grasped the hilt of his sword, as if he was going to pull it out.\"Section 9. Drawing your sword on a noble without cause, punishable by thirty lashes.\"\"What...\" finally noticing that something was not right, Captain Nevin tried to step back and create some distance between himself and Thorn, but the giant matched his step, moving right with him.\"Section 41, subparagraph B: accosting a noble in the street with the intent of harming his reputation is cause for immediate dismissal and a fine of three months of pay. This punishment does not prevent the filing of a formal defamation suit against the perpetrator.\" Continuing to loom over the captain, Thorn was no longer reading the book, but was quoting from memory. \"Section 223, subparagraph E: A formal complaint against a noble of a landed rank must be signed by the garrison commander and must be delivered in a sealed envelope. Anyone who makes the contents of the complaint public before the accused has had the opportunity to read it will be charged with slander, punishable by thirty lashes.\"\"Wha...What are you talking about?\" Captain Nevin stuttered. \"Charges have been filed against you...uh...Baron Greymane. I...We are going to need you to come with us.\"\"Have they? I assume you have the documents with you? Or are you expecting me to take your word for it?\"In all his years as a member of the city guard, Captain Nevin had never been faced with a situation like this. The crowd was looking on with interest as he floundered, and as much as he wanted to yell at them to go about their business, the giant standing in front of him was taking up his attention. His squad showed none of their normal interest in backing him up and looking at the massive figure of the noble who was staring down at him, he could not find it in his heart to blame them. \"Ah, yes...uh, yes. Here it is.\" Fumbling in his pocket, Captain Nevin produced a slightly wrinkled envelope that had been broken open. Smoothing it out he handed it to Thorn, his fluctuating expression revealing the nervousness he was trying to hide. Thorn, his eyebrows raised, took the envelope and opened it up.\"Hmm. This looks to be in order. Major Telmison is your commander? Please take me to see him. A false accusation is a very serious matter, and it needs to be dealt with as soon as possible. After all, my reputation is on the line, and I want to know who is falsely accusing me. Someone is going to have a lot to answer for.\" Thorn's expression changed abruptly as he finished speaking, and smiling down at the captain encouragingly, Thorn gestured for him to lead the way.Thrown off by the sudden shift in Thorn's demeanor, Captain Nevin floundered for a moment before smiling nervously and nodding his head respectfully as he led Thorn away. Something felt wrong with the situation, but Captain Nevin could not quite put his finger on what it was.Hiding in the crowd, Mina had to stifle a laugh as she watched the exchange. Thorn had changed greatly since they first met, and she had witnessed him get better and better at manipulating the events around him. Undoubtedly, his class specialty had only improved his ability to command others, but it was also obvious that his confidence had grown by leaps and bounds. Watching until the confused captain had respectfully escorted Thorn out of sight, she hurried off in the other direction to find Athena.Striding through the streets, Thorn did not restrain his walking speed, forcing Captain Nevin to practically run to stay in front of him. As big as he was, Thorn felt small compared to the buildings of the capital. The scale of the magical city was generous, making Thorn wonder if it had been built by a race larger than humans. The doorways, stairs, and streets of the city were all comfortable for him, leading him to believe that the humans who currently inhabited the city probably came later.After walking for ten minutes, they arrived at a large building in the center of town that served as the city's garrison. Steel armored soldiers passed through the building as they rotated their patrols, their bright armor shining in the sun. Noticing the difference between the golden armor of the patrol that had come to bring him in and the silver of the normal guards, Thorn turned to Captain Nevin.\"Captain, I noticed that your men stand out from the other guards. They not only look better trained, but their armor is a cut above the rest.\"\"Ah, these men are my bodyguards,\" the captain said quietly, taken aback by the praise. \"As a captain of the royal guard, I am able to field my own squad.\"\"Royal guard? I had assumed that you were part of the city watch. No wonder you all look so much sharper. That must be quite the expense though. I have a few soldiers myself, and I know how costly it can be to support a full squad. It is really impressive that you can finance a full squad. Especially a full squad of veterans.\"\"It's true, it's true.\" Thorn's casual conversation helped Captain Nevin relax, and he allowed a small, proud smile to light up his face. Thorn's warm tone held no mockery, encouraging the captain to puff out his chest. \"These men accompanied me during my time on the southern front. They've seen their fair share of blood. I'll tell you what, though, it wasn't easy outfitting them.\"\"You were on the southern front? I was under the impression that the southern front was peaceful?\"\"Ah, this was years ago. Ancient history.\" By now the captain had regained his proud tone and haughty demeanor. \"It was about seven years ago, there were some skirmishes against the demonkin empire, and we were at the front of it. It was dangerous, but we pulled through.\"\"I bet. War is no joke, and anyone who makes it through is worthy of respect. You said that you are the one who outfitted your guards? That isn't a uniform? That gold armor looks really good. I'm sure it doesn't hurt with the ladies, either. Not that a handsome captain like you needs any help.\" Thorn chuckled as he patted the captain on the shoulder as they arrived at the garrison door. Turning to face him, Thorn nodded to the gold armored soldiers and snapped a salute to the captain. \"Well, Captain, thank you very much for escorting me. I'll go see the major now. Wouldn't want to keep him waiting.\"\"Of course, Baron Greymane.\" Captain Nevin returned the salute and watched Thorn enter the building. Just as Thorn disappeared through the doorway, the captain's face paled and his eyes widened. Swearing out loud, he started to run forward but stopped. Thorn was already in the garrison and there was no way for them to drag him out. Shaking his head bitterly, he swore again.The message he received had instructed him to take the baron to the jail for questioning, not bring him to meet Major Telmison. However, nothing had gone according to plan. First, Thorn had immediately taken control of the encounter, totally breaking his rhythm. This was not the first time that he had participated in strong-arm tactics against a minor noble, yet he had been led by Thorn's forceful command of the situation. Thinking back over the events that had just taken place, Captain Nevin could only groan. The minister would not be pleased. He would not be pleased at all.Inside the garrison, Thorn quickly sent a message to his aunt and Mina. He had learned many things from watching Athena in the real world, and the little trick he had just used was one of them. A conversation was all about rhythm, and once the proper rhythm was grasped, it became very simple to steer the conversation. He could also feel his ability [Oration Proficiency] kicking in. It was a slightly strange feeling, but the skill brought the right words to his mind, as if they were naturally on the tip of his tongue. It also helped improve his pacing, allowing him to converse easily.The game had not just improved his speech though. Thorn could feel himself thinking faster than he would in the real world. Athena had always placed great importance on having as much information as possible, so she encouraged him to read quite often. Yet in-game, when he read a book, it was as if the information was seared into his mind, allowing him to quote chapter and verse. While his memory in the real world was good, this was something else entirely, allowing Thorn to recall with vivid detail everything that had happened to him since his adventure in Nova Terra began.Smiling at the gawking soldier behind the counter, Thorn flashed the envelope he had taken from Captain Nevin.\"I'm here to see Major Telmison. Please inform him that Baron Greymane would like a word.\" \"Uh... Please wait here, sir. I'll let the major know that you are here.\" Hurrying out of the room, the soldier left Thorn waiting at the front desk. A few minutes later, Thorn found himself, once again, standing in front of a desk piled high with papers. This time, sitting behind the desk was an old, grey-whiskered soldier whose uniform stretched tightly over his pot-belly. Shifting in his seat, the major scratched his beard as he ran his eye over Thorn's body.\"Huh, you really came.\"\"Hello, major. I'm here to discuss the false charges being laid against me.\" Unable to find a chair that looked like it would support his weight, Thorn retrieved a massive rock from his inventory. Ignoring the creaking floor when he put it down, Thorn sat on the rock comfortably and waved the envelope that held the warrant. Because of the weight reduction mechanics that Nova Terra employed, he had taken to carrying around the boulder with him in his inventory after realizing that the chairs in the game were simply not made for his weight. \"Is that... Never mind.\" Tearing his eyes away from the boulder that had just been dropped on his floor, the major fixed his eyes on the paper in Thorn's hand. \"Ah, I see that Captain Nevin found you. But for some reason you are here in my office, and I do not see the captain. Did he not inform you that you were to report to the prison?\"\"Captain Nevin did a wonderful job delivering the warrant, but I don't believe he mentioned prison, no. Why would I need to report to the prison?\"Staring at the gently smiling giant across from him, the major opened his mouth as if to speak and then closed it again. There was something about the inquisitive look in Thorn's eyes that made Major Telmison slightly apprehensive.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Did you know that  Book #3 is already finished?

There were a few things that needed to be clarified regarding the accusations leveled against you.\" Major Telmison rested his hands on his round belly as he leaned back in his chair, his face impassive. Looking around at the major's office, Thorn took his time responding. A thick, expensive-looking rug covered the floor and a glowing crystal statue dominated the corner. Behind the major,  shelves stretched the length of the wall, each displaying a variety of expensive looking trinkets. Sighing to himself, Thorn realized that he was not going to be able to bully his way out of this situation.\"Baron Greymane, let's be frank with one another. Charges like this can either be a big deal, or they can be a very small deal. It all depends on how you want it to go. I'm sure that you have spoken with Sir Trishem already and that you don't need me to explain the sort of reach and influence that the Interior Minister possesses.\" The major paused here and peered at Thorn over his half glasses. \"I understand that this situation has put you in an awkward position, but let me give you some advice. Sometimes it does not pay to take a hard stance. There is nothing wrong with bending with the times, especially when it includes the opportunity to tie yourself to an influential individual like the Interior Minister. Just imagine what your career might look like if you got on his good side?\"\"His good side, huh?\" Thorn gestured to the abundance of wealth in the room as he smiled mockingly. Unperturbed by the jab, Major Telmison gave a self-satisfied smile and patted his belly. Walking over to the shelf behind his desk, he meticulously arranged a set of small figurines made of glowing orange stone.\"Precisely, Baron. His good side. This is kardium crystal, by the way. All three statues are made of perfectly matched kardium, made by Rangor Helsham himself. It is the only set in the world. One of a kind.\" Turning back to face Thorn, the major gave a small smile and sat down at his desk again. \"You have a wonderful opportunity, Baron. Don't let it go to waste.\"In the silence, Thorn could hear the gentle ticking of an intricately carved grandfather clock. Athena had warned him that his situation was likely to become complicated, but Thorn had still not been prepared for how deep the waters of the capital were. What should have been a clear upgrade process had become a tangled web of influence and corruption. To make matters even stranger, Thorn had not received any quests associated with the tokens. Taking a moment to think over his options, Thorn finally made up his mind and sighed. Standing to his feet, he towered over the major.\"Well,\" Thorn's deep voice was mild, revealing none of his frustration. \"You better put me in jail.\"\"Good, I'm gla...\" Reaching for a contract that lay on his desk, Major Telmison's hand froze awkwardly, and he blinked a few times. \"I'm sorry, did you just say...\"\"Don't worry. I won't resist. Do you need to chain me up? I would recommend the largest chains you have. How about a black bag? I know my head is a little on the large size, so I don't mind if you use a sack.\" \"Baron...\"\"No, no,\" Thorn interrupted the major with a wave. \"I insist. You signed the warrant, so, being a law abiding citizen, I will comply. You can drag me off to jail for interrogation. Does the torture hurt? Do you still use torture? I would imagine that a civilized nation like ours wouldn't, but you never know, right? But never fear, I'll go quietly. After all, that is my duty, right?\"The major opened and closed his mouth repeatedly as he struggled to find the right words. Silently cursing Thorn for being thick, he was about to try to explain that there was no need for the situation to get out of hand when Thorn abruptly turned and pulled open the door to the room. Grabbing one of the guards in the hall, Thorn pulled him into the room.\"You, go get chains and a black bag,\" Thorn barked at the other guard and then slammed the door. Turning to the white faced guard that he had dragged into the room, Thorn took out the warrant he had taken from Captain Nevin and waved it in his face. \"Look here. There is a warrant for my arrest. You'll need at least a full squad to subdue me because I am exceedingly dangerous. Stop spacing out, there is a criminal for you to apprehend.\"Opening the door again, Thorn shoved the guard into the hall and closed the door in his face. Walking back over to the boulder he had been sitting on, he picked it up and put it away in his inventory before wandering to the shelves. Glancing over the various items on display, Thorn's gaze finally settled on the set of small statues made of kardium crystal. Picking one up, he examined it carefully, pretending not to notice the major's frantic look.\"Don't worry, Major. I told the guards to get back-up. They'll be here soon. In the meantime, I'm curious about this statue. You said it is made out of kardium? Tell me about that.\"Half an hour later, Major Telmison sat silently in his study, holding the statue that Thorn had handed him before the guards had dragged him away. Standing, he placed the statue back in its place and wiped his sweating palms on his vest. The baron had been nothing like the information had suggested, and his decisiveness in standing against the Interior Minister was entirely out of his expectation.False accusations against a noble were a serious issue and the situation was not supposed to ever come to this point. If Baron Greymane had caved to the pressure, then everything could be swept under the rug properly. Yet the baron had deviated and practically forced himself into jail, creating a sensation that would be hard to hide. He had made such a big deal of it that paperwork would have to be filed, which meant a paper trail that led right back to the major.After considering for another couple minutes, Major Telmison sat back down at his desk and retrieved a piece of paper. Very carefully, he wrote a few lines on the paper. Standing, he checked to make sure the door was locked and then moved to the shelves. Taking a box down, he opened it with a key from around his neck. Carefully, he took out a stamp and, dipping it in ink, stamped the paper.Returning the stamp to the box, he took another sheet and wrote rapidly. Unlocking a drawer and pulling it out to reveal a magical symbol, the major dropped the paper into the drawer and shut it without waiting to see if it disintegrated. He had gotten involved in this mess on the understanding that it would not be a big deal, but anyone with half a brain could tell that the baron was not going to simply let it go. Still, the Interior Minister would be able to handle it. Casting it out of his mind, Major Telmison rang a bell to call for his secretary. It was time for his second lunch.The guards escorting Thorn to prison were currently wishing that they were anywhere else. Not content to simply walk, Thorn had demanded chains and was now shuffling along, straight down the middle of the street, talking as loudly as he could. Sheepishly walking alongside him, their faces red, they all thought that it would be better if they had been deployed to the front lines to fight the Demonkin rather than having to walk the giant to jail. \"Who would have thought that a newly registered baron would be immediately accused of treachery and sent to rot in prison? Can you believe it?\" Thorn nudged one of the guards, who looked away, pretending not to feel it. Nonplussed, Thorn continued to talk to himself. \"All I did was come to register my mine. Hey, you don't think someone is after my mine, do you? I doubt it, because how could the capital be corrupt, but I was arrested right after I went to register it.\"Finally unable to handle it, one of the guards burst out, \"Sir, you are not being arrested!\"\"No?\" Thorn held up his massive hands that were bound by chains. \"Right, right. Sorry, I forgot. I am being taken in for questioning.\" Spotting a gawking merchant, Thorn waved his hands. \"Don't worry. I'm just being taken into the prison for questioning. I am absolutely not being arrested, despite the fact that they brought a warrant, and they can hold me indefinitely. Don't worry, it is not an arrest.\"\"What are you being arre... questioned about?\" The merchant was well dressed, his fat fingers covered in shining rings. Ignoring the glares from the guards, he questioned Thorn, hungry for a bit of gossip.\"Someone has accused me of being a traitor! Can you believe it? It is a false and baseless accusation, but I wouldn't give up my mine, so now I am being dragged off to prison for questioning. Me, a traitor? I demand a lawyer. I will press charges as soon as I get out of this indefinite jail stay for questioning.\" By this point, Thorn was enjoying himself massively. He had never gotten the chance to be theatrical before, so he was doing his best to milk it for everything it was worth.Murmurs broke out in the crowd, and the guards could only try to hurry Thorn along. Unfortunately for them, moving him without his cooperation was simply impossible. Every few steps he would stop and talk to the crowd, explaining the situation as if they had not just heard what was going on.The jail was only six blocks from the garrison, but it took Thorn and the guards an hour and a half to walk that distance. At one point, Thorn had claimed he was tired and refused to move unless one of the guards brought him a drink, much to the delight of the growing crowd. Players and natives alike gathered around Thorn to watch, and by the time the guards finally turned Thorn over to the prison, almost everyone in the city was aware that an abnormally large baron was being taken in on charges of treason.Rumors flew about, each one a bit more ridiculous than the last as people gossiped. After all, it wasn't often that a nobleman was arrested. The common folk were content to gossip, but as the story made its way around the noble circles, it began to take on slightly outrageous tones. Fiercely protective of their standing, the nobles of the human empire were quite outraged that a nobleman had been taken in for questioning. Being arrested in the middle of the street in broad daylight was not just an affront to the baron, but to the very position itself.Within a few hours, countless letters had arrived at the office of the interior minister, demanding that he stand out and condemn what the other nobles were calling a blatant disregard of the laws of the empire. Arresting a nobleman was not allowed without overwhelming evidence and even then, it should never be done in public.Grinding his teeth in annoyance as he read the letters, Sir Trishem summoned his clerk to find out what had happened. \"Sir, I'm not sure how things got so out of control. Captain Nevin received the instructions, but it would seem that Baron Greymane pushed his way into the major's office. According to reports from the major's office, the Baron then forced the guards to put chains on him and take him to jail, where they turned him over. The guards responded that they were entirely helpless at dealing with the baron. He was the one that wrapped himself in chains that the guards could not get off. When he got to the jail, he broke out of them as if he were not chained up. Ah, and the guards have submitted this.\"Retrieving a small stack of paper from his pocket, the clerk put it in front of the minister respectfully. His frown deepening, Sir Trishem looked them over. It took a moment for him to realize that he was holding a stack of receipts for food and drink, purchased from various shops. Confused, he looked at his clerk, who coughed and looked down.\"The baron was hungry and requested that the guards provide some food for his sustenance.\"\"And they just agreed and bought him food?\" Sir Trishem's was dangerously calm.\"Ah, yes, sir.\" The clerk's face was impassive. \"The baron would seem to be quite persuasive, sir. He was the one that reminded them to get receipts so that they could claim compensation.\"\"Oh, he did, did he?\" After staring at the expressionless clerk for a full two minutes, the minister was about to place the stack of receipts on his desk when the double doors were slammed open. \"Trishem, you better have a really good explanation for this!\" Striding into the room was a muscular man with a military haircut and a large handlebar mustache. Bursting with vitality, he stomped across the room and slapped his hand on the minister's desk, overturning a pot of ink and earning himself a death glare from the incensed minister. Obviously a military man to the bone, Duke Carlton was not deterred by the stare in the least and glared back without fear. If not for the greying at his temples it would be hard to imagine that the duke was in his fifties.\"What is the meaning of this, Carlton?\" Sir Trishem's voice was as even as always despite the deadly stare he had fixed on the Ironhold Duke. It was only the receipts crumpled in his tightly clenched fist that gave away how angry he was.\"That is exactly what I want to know!\" Duke Carlton slapped the table again, his twinkling eyes revealing how pleased he was to see Sir Trishem twitch when the ink pot rolled, spilling even more ink. \"How dare you order a baron under me arrested!\"\"I don't know what you are talking about!\" \"Oh you don't, do you? Then what is this!\" Taking the paper that was thrust at him, Sir Trishem froze, and in the sudden silence, a faint grinding noise could be heard. Held in his hand was an arrest order for Baron Greymane directed to Major Telmison and stamped by his official stamp.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Did you know that  Book #3 is already finished?

If anything, the furniture was a bit small, but three broken chairs later, the infuriated questioner allowed Thorn access to his inventory long enough to get his rock out. Despite Thorn walking into the prison with chains wrapped around his hands, they still had to treat him with the respect due to a nobleman.\"Comfortable?\" The soldier questioning Thorn was normally a large and imposing man, but next to Thorn he looked rather small. \"Yes, you can get on with your questions.\" Settling comfortably on his boulder, Thorn waved for the soldier to continue.\"You don't seem to be taking this very seriously, Baron Greymane. If you are found to be harboring traitorous thoughts, you will face execution or exile.\"\"I think I am treating this with as much seriousness as it deserves.\" Unruffled, Thorn smiled placidly. \"Besides, to face either of those outcomes, you will have to prove I have knowingly committed a traitorous action. Quite the burden of proof you have there. You were asking about the citadel I own, right? I told you that it was a gift from Hati to the Wolfkin. How am I to be responsible for what a god decides to grant their followers?\" \"You expect us to believe that a god constructed it?\" Scoffing openly, the soldier laughed. \"If you are going to lie, at least come up with something believable.\"\"I don't expect you to believe anything. But your belief is not a prerequisite for it being true. If you have any shred of sense, you'll stop this farce before it ruins your career.\" Still smiling, Thorn leaned forward, meeting the soldier's gaze. \"There are forces fighting here that are above your pay grade. Frankly, they're above mine as well. We're the disposable cannon fodder in a war that is not actually about us. Don't dig a pit you cannot get out of, because I guarantee that no one will be interested in pulling you out when everything settles.\"The soldier was about to snap back when Thorn leaned back and looked at the door as it opened. A sharp looking officer came in and stared at Thorn, who looked back at him with a smile. Waving away the soldier's salute, the officer pointed at Thorn.\"Send him to cell six.\"With a clang, the cell door shut behind Thorn, and he found himself in a large, stone-walled space. A single window set high up on the wall allowed weak sunlight to shine down on the scattered hay that covered the dirty floor. Two metal bunks were held to the wall with chains, providing a place for prisoners to lie down. A dark bundle of ragged blankets on the bottom bunk shifted as Thorn entered the cell, and a bleary looking elf poked his head out to look at Thorn.*ding* *WHAM*As Thorn looked at the notification he had received, the elf sat up suddenly, smacking his head on the metal upper bunk. With a groan, he fell back, clutching his head, only to roll right off of the bunk onto the floor where he writhed in pain.\"Uh, are you okay?\"Waving Thorn away, the elf struggled to sit up. As he looked closer, Thorn realized that what he had originally taken to be a pile of rags was actually the elf's clothing. Producing a mirror from his ragged costume, the elf carefully examined his forehead. After seeing that there was no visible damage, he put the mirror away and sprang to his feet. Giving Thorn a sweeping bow, the elf flashed a wide smile, his perfect teeth glinting in the weak light.\"Well met, Moon Wolf. I am Corvo, the All-Seeing Raven.\"\"You can just call me Thorn.\"\"Thorn, huh? Good thing that this challenge is not a contest of strength.\" Now that he had a chance to properly take in Thorn's massive size, he could only sigh in relief. Fighting someone as large as Thorn would be difficult in any situation, but having to fight him in an enclosed cell would be a complete nightmare.\"Um, it is.\"\"What?!\" \"Hey, keep it down in there!\" A guard outside banged on the bars.\"Yeah, it looks like I am supposed to show you who is boss. It says I need to beat you up until you admit that Hati is better.\"\"Are you kidding?\" Corvo's face was white as a ghost as he edged backward.\"Nope, sorry.\" Thorn shrugged.\"Oh, god, why do you do this to me?\" Ignoring Corvo's moaning, Thorn walked over to the window. Set at Thorn's eye height, it was much too high for most people to look out. Outside, Thorn could see the yard of the prison. After watching the guards for a while, Thorn turned to the metal beds stapled to the wall. They were too close together for Thorn to sit down, so he grabbed the top bunk and casually ripped it from the wall. With a terrible screech, the pins holding the bunk to the wall popped free, clattering across the stone floor. Across the room, Corvo's figure shuddered, and he began to whisper furiously to himself. In the hallway, the guard who had previously yelled at Corvo pointed and stammered, unable to process what had happened. \"Wha... What are you doing?!\" Livid, the guard started to rush into the cell but stopped just as his hand reached the door. Thinking better about entering a cell with a giant who had just ripped a metal bed from a solid stone wall, he looked around wildly.\"My inventory doesn't work and I need somewhere to sit,\" Thorn said blandly, bending the metal frame into a stool. Gingerly sitting down on it, he nodded. The stool creaked under his weight but held fast. \"If you've got something else to sit on, let me know. Until then, I'm going to use this.\"\"You...\" Speechless, the guard could only glare at Thorn. He would have cursed him out, but he had been reminded multiple times that Thorn was a baron, and they had to be careful how they treated him.\"Alright. Down to business.\" Having settled his seating, Thorn turned his attention to Corvo, who was standing as far away as possible. \"Do you want to admit that Hati is better or should we fight? I'm fine with either.\"\"Hold on, hold on. Don't you think this is an unfair challenge? How am I supposed to fight you? You are at least three times my size and neither of us has our abilities!\"\"I don't make the rules.\" Thorn shrugged. \"All you have to do is say that Hati is better, what's the harm in that?\"\"What's the harm? Really? Just because you are bigger, doesn't mean you should bully other people. That's what this is, you know. Pure bullying.\" Corvo cocked his head to the side, as if he was listening to something. \"Huginn says that he agrees. Hati only knows how to bully others with his bigger size. Wolves are supposed to be cunning, but Hati knows that he can't compete with Huginn when it comes to intelligence, so he just relies on force. Like god like avatar, huh?\"[Foolishness.] Hati's voice suddenly appeared in Thorn's mind. [That featherbrain has never once outwitted me. If he does not care for his pride, why should we spare him? We will play his game.]*ding* \"It would seem that Hati does not agree with you. Our contest has been changed to a riddle challenge?\" Thorn re-read the notification. \"There are no details regarding how we are to carry it out.\"Reading his own notification, Corvo sighed and wiped his forehead in relief. \"Whew, that is much better.\" Regaining some of his poise, he walked over to sit on the lower bunk that was still suspended on the wall. \"How about this. We will alternate, each asking the other person a riddle. One point for every properly answered riddle, zero points if you get it wrong or can't answer. So, if you answer my riddle and I cannot answer yours, you win and vice versa.\"\"Sure, that sounds fair.\" Musing over the conditions that Corvo proposed, Thorn nodded.\"Oh, and let's set some ground rules. No browsers or looking up the riddles on the internet. No contacting others. No, 'what's in my pocket' riddles either.\"\"And no asking for help,\" Thorn added. \"Yeah. Purely me versus you. Excellent. Any other rules?\" Seeing Thorn shake his head, Corvo smiled. \"Would you like to go first? If not, I have a good one.\"\"Go ahead.\"\"Okay, here we go. A prisoner is brought in for questioning. The captain of the guard sits him down and says, 'If you tell a lie, we will hang you. But if you tell the truth, we will cut your head off.' What can the prisoner say to save himself?\"\"That's a good one.\" Thorn nodded. \"But I've heard a riddle similar to that. The prisoner says, 'You will hang me.' That way he is telling the truth, but if they try to cut off his head, then he will have lied.\"\"Curses, I thought that might get you. Your turn.\"\"Before I give you my riddle, do you mind if I ask you some other questions? I'm very curious about how you became an avatar.\" Seeing Corvo's face harden at the question, Thorn quickly continued. \"Not the specifics or anything, I am just curious about how you got here. I'm new to Nova Terra, and I have only met one other avatar so far.\"\"Oh? Who'd you meet?\" \"Salliish's avatar, Josephine. We fought a bit but ended the day on more-or-less friendly terms.\"\"So you are saying that I was right to not try and fight you.\" Corvo chuckled. \"Josephine has some really powerful snake summons and her Naga form is nothing to sneer at.\"\"You know her?\"\"Mmhmm. Most of the avatars who have been playing for awhile have interacted a few times. The gods are quite fond of these challenges. We think that they are waiting for an avatar that can beat all the others.\"\"That makes sense. Maybe they want to see who the chief god is? How many gods are there anyway? So far I have met two other avatars, but are there hundreds walking around?\"\"Oh, no, no. There are a fair number of minor gods, like Mayordi, the god of merchants, or Ves, the god of thieves, but there are seven major gods who watch over natural domains. This is not counting Eve, of course. The AI rules everything. But as far as the gods who have avatars are concerned, there are three sets of gods and a seventh, stand-alone god. \"Day and night are the gods Skoll and Hati. Shadow is Salliish and light is Baldur. The god of the earth is Skadi, whose counterpart is Tyra, the god of the sky. The seventh is Huginn, the All-Seeing Raven, whom I serve. Huginn is the god of knowledge. Up until this point, there have been six avatars. You are the seventh. The last.\"\"I met Salliish's avatar a month or so ago and was a little confused by how closely their domain overlapped with mine. With seven major gods, why are two of the sets so similar?\"\"Ah, you mean Salliish and Hati?\"\"Yeah.\" Thorn nodded. \"And Baldur and Skoll. God of day seems really similar to god of light.\"\"There are similarities, but night and shadow are quite different. Salliish is more the god of trickery and deceit, whereas Hati protects the world at night. According to the lore, the devils seek to devour the world every night, bringing darkness to the land. Hati, the Moon Wolf, fights them off, roaming the land to protect its people against the devils. During the day, Skoll takes over, fighting back the frost giants who seek to drown the world in an endless tide of undead. But Skoll is different from Baldur, who is called the god of light, but is really the god of truth and justice. Tyra oversees weather and travel while Skadi takes care of farming and production, and the home.\"\"Okay, that makes more sense. Where does Huginn fit in all of this?\"\"Huginn is a bit different from the rest as his job is to observe and make sure that everything is happening as it should. Huginn is responsible for communicating between the gods and for watching over the world.\"\"That is a pretty big responsibility.\"\"It is annoying, is what it is.\" Sighing, Corvo rolled his eyes. \"Constant running, here and there and everywhere. All I ever do is go here to meet this person or there to meet another. And everywhere I go I get into these stupid avatar challenges that always seem to feature someone beating my face in.\"\"It can't always be bad.\" Thorn couldn't help but smile at Corvo's complaining. \"If it was, you would not be playing anymore, right?\"\"Ha, I guess that is true. There are a couple benefits to being an avatar. Though it often feels like I am nothing more than a gopher, I am quite interested in seeing how the world changes now that you are here.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"There have been six avatars for a long time now. I think the sixth joined in the second year of the game. For whatever reason, Hati did not pick an avatar until now. But, here you are. I must confess, I'm excited to see what is going to happen now that there are seven avatars.\" \"If you find out, let me know.\" Pausing, Thorn took a moment to consider everything he had just learned, before looking up. \"Alright, my turn to give you a riddle.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Are you interested in reading the rest of Book #3?

With his highly attuned hearing, Thorn could pick out three sets of feet that stood out from among the guard's jackboots. The sharp click of a pair of high heels mixed with a solid thud of a leather shoe. Both were joined by the nervous patter of a pair of boots, reminding Thorn of the captain of the guard who had locked him up.\"A promise.\" Thorn grinned at Corvo. \"A promise gets broken without being held.\"The avatar of the All-Seeing Raven dropped his head with an aggrieved sigh. For the last seven hours they had exchanged riddles back and forth, neither one able to gain an advantage. Shooting an accusing look at Thorn, Corvo sneered.\"You know? You are not nearly as dumb as you look.\"\"Haha, thanks. Neither are you.\" Thorn chuckled as he stood up and stretched. \"I don't quite understand why everyone assumes that I'm dumb, though.\"\"Might be the fact that you are as big as a mountain. Most people who grow to your size don't have the extra space for a brain.\"\"See, that isn't true. Just because some large people are not gifted mentally, doesn't mean that we're all stupid. Besides, being small doesn't make you smart. It just makes you weak,\" Thorn teased. Stepping over to the door of the cell, Thorn nodded to one of the guards. \"Hey, any chance of getting some food? I'm starving.\"\"Um...\" Obviously intimidated by Thorn's size and strength, the guard stammered for a while. Judging from the way that Thorn ripped the metal bed from the wall where it had been fastened, the bars at the front of the cell would not serve their purpose should Thorn decide to try and break through them.\"Hey, no pressure. Normally I carry my own food, but I can't get into my inventory since you locked me up in here,\" Thorn explained, taking a glance up the hallway. Seeing that the guards still had not arrived, he turned back to face Corvo. \"Last one. Then I'll be leaving. I have forests but no trees, mountains with no stones, lakes with no water. What am I?\"\"Leaving? Are you breaking your way out of here?\" Confused, Corvo stood up. \"No, someone is coming to get me out. How about you? You said you had been locked in here a month ago. When do you get out?\"\"I... I'm not sure.\" Corvo shrugged. \"I don't actually know why they brought me in. After meeting you, I would assume that the game was organizing a meeting between us. I mean, Huginn was organizing the meeting. You know what I mean.\"The sound of footsteps echoed down the corridor, causing the two guards at the entrance to the cell to straighten up and stand at attention. Hearing the footsteps, Corvo's eyes brightened and he jumped off the bed, coming to stand next to Thorn at the bars.\"Hey, you weren't joking right? If you are getting out of here, you should bring me with you. Otherwise I'll probably be stuck in this cell for another month.\"\"Why should I bring you? You can't even answer my riddle.\"\"What? Oh, a map. A map has forests but no trees, mountains with no stones, and lakes with no water. I'm serious, you should get me out.\" Seeing that Thorn was rolling his eyes, Corvo tried to sweeten the deal. \"Listen, you have a guild, right? I can join your guild. Having two avatars in the same guild will be better than just having one, right?\"\"I dunno. So far you don't seem very strong. I don't know that I want to clutter up my guild with inferior talent.\" Thorn said with a smile and a shrug.\"Inferior talent? Are you serious? Sure, I might not be able to take you in a fight, but I could run circles around you when it comes to making plans.\"\"Eh, we already have a strategist who can run circles around me. Plus, you couldn't beat me at a riddle contest, so what makes you think that you'll be any real use?\"\"What about information gathering? I'm probably the best in the game when it comes to finding secrets.\" The closer the footsteps came, the more desperate Corvo was becoming.\"We already have an intelligence officer. You probably know him. Oberlin? I've heard he is quite famous.\"\"Oberlin is in your guild?\" Corvo visibly deflated. \"I know Oberlin. Look, if you can get me out, I promise I'll be a big help to your guild. All you have to do is convince them to let me go.\"Thorn's mind spun as he thought it over. Corvo had displayed formidable intelligence over the last seven hours, answering the riddles that Thorn posed with almost no pause. Thorn had taken far longer to come up with answers, and he knew that if the contest stretched on he was going to lose. However, Corvo was also an unknown factor. As an avatar it was highly likely that he had his own agenda, and Thorn did not like the idea of an unstable element in his guild.Corvo, seeing Thorn's frown, grimaced and shared a window.*ding* \"That seems overpowered.\" Thorn's eyes narrowed as he read the title's description.\"Huh, like being able to bend steel with your bare hands isn't overpowered.\" Corvo pointed at the metal bed that Thorn had fashioned into a seat.\"Okay, that is a fair point.\" Thorn shrugged. He was the last player who should be complaining about other players having advantages. \"Tell you what. I can get you out of here if you are willing to come under contract. My guild, Nova Luna, is comprised of two parts. The professional team which is comprised of employees who are paid an annual contract, and the social guild, who accepts anyone that meets the requirements. If you want to get out, I can invite you to join the professional team, but you'll need to sign a contract for at least a year of employment.\"\"A year in game time?\"\"No, real time. Seven years in Nova Terra. You'll be playing for us during that time.\"\"Are you serious?\" It was Corvo's turn to look at Thorn like he was crazy. \"You want me to trade a few months in jail for seven years of working for you? Why on earth would I do that?\"\"Don't you want to see what the seventh avatar is going to do?\" Thorn smiled again, but this time, his smile was filled with a boundless confidence that caused Corvo's breath to catch. \"What better way than walking by my side? After all, if the gods are arranging for all of us to meet for some reason, don't you want to know why? Not only will you get to see what happens when I beat all of the other avatars, but you'll get paid along the way.\"Thorn's words oozed with confidence, but as much as Corvo wanted to refute his words, he couldn't. What he had seen when he examined Thorn had left him stunned, and he had no doubt that Thorn could beat any two avatars combined in a physical confrontation. With a deep sigh, he shook his head.\"Let me take a look at the contract.\"Seeing the avatar of Huginn admit defeat, Thorn sent him the contract he had prepared. The conditions were generous and not overly restrictive, so Corvo signed it and sent it back. Forwarding it to his lawyer, Thorn held out a big hand.\"Welcome to the guild, Corvo. I'm sure you'll have a great time. Oh, just one more thing. Your first job as a member of Nova Luna is to admit that Hati is better.\"Twitching, Corvo stared at Thorn's face, unable to find even a smidge of duplicity in his smiling eyes. With a sigh, the Elf's shoulders slumped, and he mumbled something under his breath.*ding* Feeling slightly bad, Thorn was about to speak when he noticed that Corvo's face had perked up. Raising his eyebrows, he waited for the Elf to speak.\"Ha, look at that. My favor went up. It looks like Huginn is pleased that I'm hanging out with you.\" Corvo shared the notification he had received showing that, rather than lose favor, he had actually gained favor with his god.[You do well to bring this one with you.] Hati's warm voice filled Thorn's head. [Despite his arrogance, Huginn is a valuable ally, and his avatar will aid you well.]\"Thorn!\" A slightly worried voice rang through the corridor as a group of guards rounded the corner. Looking through the bars, Thorn could see Athena hurrying toward the cell, the others trying to keep up with her swift pace. \"Hey, are you okay, kid? They didn't do anything to you, did they?\"Sensing the worry in her voice, Thorn took his aunt's hand in his, patting it reassuringly. \"I'm totally fine. Maybe a little hungry. But they didn't do anything besides locking me in here. How are things on your side?\"\"Let's get you out of there, and then we'll talk about it.\" Athena's face took on a frosty look, her anger at the situation evident. Turning to one of the guards, she snapped, \"Hey, aren't you going to open up the cell? We don't have all day.\"Fumbling for his keys, the captain of the guard who had accompanied Athena stepped forward and opened the cell door. Thorn, ducking through, motioned for Corvo to follow him out.\"This is Corvo, he is part of my guild. I don't know why he is in prison, but I want to get him out.\"\"Hello, Corvo.\" Athena's brows furrowed slightly at the sight of the raggedly dressed Elf before her eyes turned back to Thorn. \"This is Markus, the lawyer who is handling your bail. Markus, see what you can do about our elven friend here.\"\"Of course, Ms. Athena.\" Giving a half bow, the pudgy lawyer looked at the captain of the guard, who sighed and nodded resignedly.A few minutes later, Thorn found himself sitting on his boulder, a broken couch leaning awkwardly next to him. Corvo perched on the other end of the couch, still chuckling at the sight he had just seen. Athena was sitting across from him, drinking coffee and watching fondly as Thorn devoured piece after piece of fruit that he pulled from his inventory. Placing her cup on the table, Athena cleared her throat.\"You sure like prison, huh?\" \"Mmm,\" Thorn swallowed the banana he had just tossed in his mouth. \"It's not that I like it, per se. I think that Nova Terra just doesn't like me.\"\"Haha, sure, sure. While we wait for Markus, let me give you a rundown of what is going on.\" Pausing slightly, her eyes flicked over to Corvo, who was watching Thorn in fascination. \"Corvo is a member of the professional team, so he has signed a non-disclosure agreement. You can speak freely.\" Still tossing whole pieces of fruit in his mouth, Thorn noticed Athena's glance.\"Alright. This is the situation. Sir Trishem, the Interior Minister, is still trying to delay your application of the [Nobility Upgrade Token], as well as your legacy deeds. We still are not one hundred percent sure why he is doing this. The best we can figure is that this is part of a power struggle between the empire and the dukes. The Ironhold Duke is currently the second most powerful duke in the empire, and the addition of a new viscount will edge him to the number one spot, since viscounts are allowed to raise an army of fifteen thousand. At the moment, as a baron, you are limited to 5000 infantry, with no specialist troops. Viscounts triple that and they are allowed to dedicate 3000 of those slots to specialist troops like cavalry.\"\"Wouldn't having more troops in the empire be good for everyone?\"\"Yes and no. Yes if you only take the coming war with the south into consideration. No if you have to compete with the Ironhold Duke for merit. The duchies look peaceful, but there is quite a struggle going on underneath the surface. There is likely pressure by the other three dukes to try and force the Ironhold Duke into a passive position.\"\"Okay, I can understand that.\" Thorn scratched his head, biting an apple in half. \"But why are they so concerned about fifteen thousand soldiers? That doesn't seem like much.\"\"They aren't.\" Corvo spoke up. \"They are concerned that you will advance in rank. Fifteen thousand isn't much, but what about fifty thousand? And what if they are players, not natives? Players can respawn. Players have better gear and learn skills faster. And as the leader of an entire race and a guild, you have a high likelihood of being able to recruit a force almost entirely comprised of players.\"\"That is exactly right.\" Athena nodded, taking another look at Corvo. \"He nailed the problem on the head. They probably wouldn't care if you were a native, but you are an immortal traveler, which means you will probably climb in noble rank. Currently, you are not a threat. But once you gain more authority, you will be a major thorn in their side.\"Rolling his eyes, Thorn ignored his aunt's self satisfied grin at her pun. Wiping his hands off, he considered the problem that faced him. Taking up the position of baron had solved one problem by forcing Ragnarok to back off, but it had thrust him into the middle of a conflict that he wanted no part of. Still, the benefits of being a noble far outweighed the drawbacks, so he would have to figure out a way to forge ahead. So far it seemed like the duke of the Ironhold Duchy was supporting his position, but Thorn did not want to have to rely on external forces if he did not have to.\"I think I understand the situation.\" Thorn glanced between Corvo and his aunt. \"Time for you to show me your skill, Corvo. What are our options?\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Are you interested in reading the rest of Book #3?

Come explore the world of Nova Terra and help me determine where the story goes.You can find out more about me at www.sethring.com", "\"The problem is complicated. On the one hand, you have value, and not only as a baron. You have significant personal resources, and anyone with half a brain can see that you are a formidable combatant in your own right. You also possess personal wealth that will help whomever gets you under their banner. This is offset by the danger that you bring to the current balance of power in the empire. Three of the four dukes don't want you to get stronger, and the Interior Minister is on their side. \"On your side, the Ironhold Duke wants you to succeed in growing, but only if you grow in such a way that doesn't threaten him. We can't assume that he'll be friendly forever. An expansion of your power could destabilize his duchy. To put it succinctly, there are lots of sides who have power and want to keep power, but you've popped up in their way. They either have to use you for their ends or get rid of you before you get big enough to claim a slice of the pie.\"Sighing at the convoluted problem, Corvo stood up and walked to the window, distractedly biting one of his fingers. Behind him, Thorn and Athena exchanged glances. From the look in his aunt's eyes, Thorn knew that she did not approve of him throwing the problem to someone that he had just met, and he really could not blame her. Smiling in what he hoped was a reassuring manner, Thorn looked at the raggedly dressed figure by the window. Hati had said that Corvo would be a help to him, and the Moon Wolf had not led him astray so far, so Thorn was inclined to trust whatever plan Corvo came up with. Still, Thorn had asked the question as a test of Corvo's abilities more than anything else. He had already explained the situation to Velin in a message and was confident that she was working on a plan already.Staring out the window, Corvo pondered, his mind rapidly going over all of the information he had. Freezing for a split second, his eyes lit up and he spun around, his cloak rustling. \"I got it. The situation is complicated, so the first thing we do is simplify. What does each side want? The Interior Minister wants stability and resources. The three dukes want to keep the Ironhold Duke from getting stronger. The Ironhold Duke wants to get stronger. We cannot solve the problem fully until we can give everyone what they want or have enough power that they stop wanting it. What we can do is give everyone a little bit of what they want.\"\"Sure, but the question is how do we do that.\"\"Just listen.\" Corvo held up his hand so Thorn wouldn't interrupt him. \"If we give everyone just enough, they'll probably be willing to let it go. After all, making this issue big will disrupt the balance of the empire, which none of the sides want to see. Currently, the charges laid against you hinge on the fact that you do not have enough resource points to possess the citadel you built. Being a baron and the leader of a race, you have five points, right? So, the simple answer seems to be getting a military rank. However, if you get a rank under the banner of the Ironhold Duke, the other Dukes will do everything in their power to stop you.\"\"Because of the player-filled army thing?\"\"Yes. Who would want their competitor to have an army of semi-immortal soldiers who can fight for days at a time? Certainly not any of the dukes. But what if you took a different route? What if you applied for a position as a crusader?\"\"A what?\"\"Crusader.\"\"You say that like I should know what it means.\" Corvo opened his mouth and then shut it, unsure of what to say. Turning to look at Athena, all he got was a shrug.\"Thorn just started playing six months ago. In-game time.\" Athena hid her smile behind a cough.\"Ah. Right. You're a noob. Got it.\" Enlightenment dawned on Corvo's face. \"The last major world event was called the Crusades of Flame and Shadow. It introduced a bunch of different types of classes and a specialized battlefield where players could lead armies to battle against hordes of devils or angelic hosts. The players who allied themselves with the human empire fought against devils while the players who allied with the demonkin fought against angels.\"The position of crusader is technically a military position, and if the Empire goes to war, you can be called on to fight, but it puts you under the crusader military command, not the empire's normal command. This means you would be part of the military, but the Ironhold Duke would not be able to command you unless the empire goes to war. This would satisfy the three dukes, which would give the minister the stability he wanted. On the other hand, the Ironhold Duke would be getting a powerful subordinate if war ever broke out, which should be enough.\"\"Will that work?\" Thorn frowned, looking at Athena, who was staring at Corvo in undisguised admiration.\"It will absolutely work.\" Athena nodded slowly. \"The Ironhold Duke doesn't want you to grow big enough to challenge his power, but who could possibly resist the temptation of a player army under their command? That will be enough for him. As for the other dukes, they can't block your application to become a crusader, so they will comfort themselves with the knowledge that their competitor is not going to be able to command you, either. As for the minister, he'll just have to get over it.\"After thinking it over, Thorn nodded. \"Alright. Let's do it. What is the procedure?\" It was not a perfect solution, but it would certainly work for the time being.\"The crusaders in the human empire are called the Order of the Flame. They have a building here in the capital where you can sign up your guild.\" Corvo pointed out the window to a tall building sticking up in the distance. Looking closely, Thorn could see a golden flame burning above the spire. \"Once you have signed up, you can enter the battlefield with a small force of soldiers. As you do better, you'll be able to bring more people in. The rank you have in the Order will transfer to the normal army, should the need ever arise.\"\"What about the minister? How do we deal with him?\" Athena looked at Corvo, who shrugged.\"I don't know. It will depend how greedy he is. We can probably get him to back off for now, but I would guess that he will see the investigation through to the very end. Because of the big stink that Thorn made when he got arrested, it isn't likely that they will try and keep you in jail. But I could see the investigation dragging out indefinitely. If he isn't satisfied.\"\"We will worry about that when the time comes. For now, let's focus on registering as a crusader. After that, I should be free to travel back to the valley. We can plan what to do from there.\" Thorn's excellent hearing had picked up the sound of feet coming up the stairs toward their room, so he ended the conversation.After dealing with the final paperwork, the lawyer that Athena had brought had Thorn and Corvo sign the release forms, and the guards escorted them out of the jail. Standing outside, Mina and Oberlin met them. \"Those guards looked almost happy to see you leave.\" Mina giggled. \"What, were you eating all their food? Or maybe you were sitting on their furniture.\"\"Corvo?\" Peering at the figure behind Thorn, Oberlin's eyes widened. \"How's it going? I thought you were down south?\"\"What? You can escape from the Ordo Serpentes, but I can't?\" The elf grinned, slapping hands with the thief.\"You got out? That is awesome. Yeah, Thorn helped me cut loose.\" Oberlin jerked a thumb at the giant who was being teased by Mina. \"What are you up to these days?\"\"I got suckered into joining a guild.\"\"Haha, really? Again? You just don't have much luck, huh? Who is the lucky guild?\"Flipping over his hand, Corvo activated his guild symbol, causing a glowing, silver light to form over his palm. As the symbol materialized, Oberlin could clearly see the silhouette of a howling wolf set over a citadel, the full moon in the background. His eyes growing wide, the thief nearly choked. Sighing, Corvo nodded at his friend's reaction.\"Yeah. Exactly. Don't let anyone tell you that big guys are dumb. Biggest scam ever.\"\"Haha, it's not that bad.\" Pleased, Oberlin patted the moping elf on the shoulder. \"The contract conditions are really good. Plus, I have a good feeling about this guild.\"Rolling his eyes, Corvo hurried after Thorn, who had started to walk toward the Order of the Flame. The building the Order occupied rose majestically into the air, flying buttresses supporting thick stone walls and a tall, peaked roof with a sharp spire that could be seen from across the city. It reminded Thorn of a gothic building, and though it lacked the two large towers of Notre-Dame, he could see the influence that had bled into the game.Standing rock still in front of the door to the building, two crusader guards stared imposingly at everyone who hurried by. Heavily armored, they held greatswords in front of them, the points resting on the ground. A brilliant red tabard, embroidered with a white and gold flame on the chest, set them apart from the crowd, showing their allegiance to the Order of the Flame. As Thorn and the others walked up the stairs to the door, one of the armored crusaders stepped forward, his hand out.\"What business do you have here?\" The guard's voice was cold, though Thorn did not detect any animosity in him.\"I've come to join the crusade.\"\"Ah, as a commissioned knight.\" Corvo hurried up to stand beside Thorn. \"A commissioned knight. We are not enlisting.\" The eyes of the guard that lit up at Thorn's answer dimmed slightly when he heard Corvo's words. Stepping aside, he gestured to the door. \"Welcome, the Order of the Flame is open to you.\"\"Thanks.\" Nodding at the other guard, who looked on impassively, Thorn led his group through the large double doors into the gothic building. As they walked, he glanced down at Corvo. \"What was that about?\"\"Um. You have to be pretty specific about these things. Players can enlist in the Order, but if they do so, they are under the command of a native officer. We don't want to do that. We want an independent command, or knighthood. As a commissioned knight, you can enlist other players to your force, bringing them with you to the battlefield.\"\"Got it. Thanks.\"The entryway opened into a giant room with a massive, vaulted ceiling covered in murals depicting the Order's fight against the devils. Scenes of terrible struggle, heroic moments, and even horrific defeat chronicled the history of the Order. In real life, the Order had only been around for a year and a half. Still, in the eleven years that passed in Nova Terra, much had occurred.Athena led the way to a small alcove in the wall where an armored man stood, gazing at a broken shield. Stopping behind him, she gestured for Thorn and the others to wait quietly. A minute passed, and then two, and Mina, unable to stand still, wandered off to look at the rest of the large room, accompanied by Oberlin. After almost ten minutes of waiting, the man turned around, his face lighting up when he saw Athena.\"Athena! Welcome. What brings you to the temple today?\" \"Hello, Glavius. I'm here to introduce my nephew to the Order for a position as a commissioned knight.\"\"Oh? I take it that you will be his guarantor?\" \"Correct.\"\"Well, in that case, follow me.\" Leading the way through a side door, he brought the three of them to an open yard where a number of soldiers were practicing with their greatswords. The soldiers, seeing Glavius enter the yard, stopped their practice and gathered along the side, holding their greatswords in front of them like the guards at the door. Glavius stopped in the center of the yard, turning to face Thorn and gesturing for the giant to stand in front of him.\"The basic requirements for joining the Order as a commissioned knight are as follows. The prospective knight must make a donation to the Order of five hundred gold. The prospective knight must demonstrate an aptitude for combat comparable to a veteran crusader. Finally, the prospective knight must vow to fight against the corrupting influence of the devils that seek to dominate our lands.\"\"Sure. Sounds straightforward enough.\" Thorn nodded.\"Excellent. I will take the donation and then we can begin with the combat assessment.\" After collecting the payment from Thorn, Glavius called over one of the soldiers who had been practicing. \"This is Kels. He will be assisting with the assessment. Kels is a veteran of hundreds of battles with the devils and will not be an easy opponent. All you have to do is avoid being defeated for five minutes against him. All weapons and armor are allowed, as are abilities. Any questions?\"\"No, I think I get it.\" Flexing his fingers, Thorn summoned his armor.\"Good, you may begin.\"At the side, Corvo looked on in appreciation, curious to see what sort of combat abilities his fellow avatar possessed. Next to him, Athena watched calmly.Thorn's silver armor glinted in the red evening light, adding a bloody tinge to the wolf motif around the helmet. Summoning his weapon, Thorn held it loosely in his hand, the sheer weight of it sending out a spider web of cracks as the end rested on the ground between him and Kels. The massive metal spike had changed greatly since his battle with Ouroboros at the gates of the citadel. During the time he spent waiting in the capital, Thorn had his impromptu weapon reforged into a terrifying-looking tetsubo. Flanged ribs covered the top half of the six foot spike, and the bottom had been converted into a comfortable grip.Thorn lifted his gauntleted hand, gesturing for his opponent to begin. With a roar Kels dashed forward, his greatsword cutting down in an overhead chop. Lifting his tetsubo, Thorn blocked, allowing the incoming blade to deflect toward the ground. Moving with the momentum, Kels planted his right foot and twisted his body around, his large sword slashing toward Thorn's side with vicious speed. Not underestimating the weight of the incoming blow, Thorn thrust his tetsubo forward, the spiked end shooting toward Kels like a spear. A veteran combatant, Kels grunted and forcibly pushed his torso backward, practically lying down on his back. Quickly turning his dodge into a backward roll, Kels regained his feet easily, his sword out in front of him. Cautiously, he stared at Thorn, who had not moved from where he stood.\u00a0-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Are you interested in reading the rest of Book #3?

At 8' 9\", Thorn's reach was massive, and adding on a six foot weapon made it that much harder for enemies to close the distance. Cautiously edging to the side, Kels switched his grip on his sword, positioning it between himself and the point of Thorn's tetsubo, which followed him as he moved.The soldier took a half-step to the right and suddenly reversed direction, dashing forward, his sword angled along his shoulder to guard against Thorn's mace. Quickly closing the distance, he was about to unleash a swing when Thorn abruptly stepped forward, snapping a kick toward Kel's chest. Once again, Kels' flexibility saved him as he barely managed to twist his torso away from the blow.Unperturbed, Thorn flicked his tetsubo, sending it whirling toward Kels' head. Watching it come, Kels felt his blood run cold. The weight of the weapon was enough to crush him, and watching Thorn swing it with ease told him just how dangerous it would be to get hit. Just as he braced himself for impact, Thorn stopped the weapon short, and Kels fell on his backside, scrambling backward to get out of range. With a single step forward, Thorn was again in range, and with a snap of his wrist, his weapon flew down again, smashing into the ground next to Kels. The soldier had raised his sword in an attempt to protect himself as much as possible, only to find that Thorn's tetsubo landed on the ground next to him with a powerful thud that sent chips of stone flying through the air. The sheer weight of the weapon was enough to crush stone despite Thorn barely putting any strength into the strike. Imagining what would have happened to him if it had hit, Kels looked at his commanding officer in horror, his face drained of any color. Not continuing to attack, Thorn stood silently, his eyes turning to Glavius. His opponent was not even bothering to try and continue the fight, so Thorn stopped as well.\"I think we can stop here.\" Glavius stepped forward to stand between the two combatants. \"Thank you, Kels. You may step down. Baron Greymane, it is obvious from the way you handle your mace that you are up to our standard. The last remaining procedure before you join the ranks of the Order of the Flame as a commissioned knight is the oath. The Order of the Flame holds three tenets. First, slay the devil wherever you find it. Second, protect the land from the spread of corruption. Third, rally to the aid of the empire in the hour of need. Do you swear to uphold the three tenets of the Order?\"\"I do.\"*ding* \"Excellent.\" Glavius' face broke into a wide grin. \"Welcome to the Order of the Flame. I look forward to hearing about your exploits upon the field of battle. I'm sure that you'll be a force to be reckoned with.\"The next evening, Thorn gathered with the rest of his team in the guild hall of the Society of Roses. Mina, Oberlin, and Corvo sat on couches in the meeting room while Thorn made do with his large boulder. They were waiting for Athena to return from meeting with the lawyer that had handled Thorn and Corvo's release from jail.Earlier in the day, Thorn had made social calls to the four dukes, explaining that he was going to be focusing his efforts on the Battlefield of Flame and Shadow. Though the Ironhold Duke was not entirely pleased, the other dukes were very supportive of Thorn's attitude and choice. The Interior Minister, Sir Trishem, behaved just as Corvo said he would, sending one of his clerks to inform Thorn that the investigation was ongoing and that, while Thorn was free to return to his home, they may need him to come to the capital in the future.The door opened and Athena strode in. Rising, Thorn grabbed a glass from the side table and poured her some wine. Throughout his childhood, he had greeted her like this countless times when she returned from work, and the motion was even more natural now. Smiling broadly, she took the glass from him and sat next to Mina.\"Everything should be good for your trip back to the valley. Having joined the Order of the Flame, you have two weeks to run your first crusade. By the time you get back to the valley, you'll have a week to recruit and train your team. Most guilds have max rep at this point, so you shouldn't face significant competition in the crusades. You'll probably be competing against some of the smaller guilds and casual teams. Still, you'll probably find some good players, so don't slack off.\"\"Sounds good. Velin mentioned in her last message that the valley is already starting to fill up with players. Recruitment has opened up for the guild, and we're starting to process applications, as well. Thanks to the help of the Society of Roses, she has been able to get through them at a pretty good pace, and we're close to having a raiding team. She wanted to wait till we get back to do the final tryouts, but we've had close to six thousand social applications and four hundred and fifty professional team applications from current pro-players.\"\"That's pretty good.\" Corvo sat up. \"How in the world did you get so many professional players to apply?\"\"I'm not one hundred percent sure. Velin just mentioned the number.\"\"Haha, I know.\" Mina clapped her hands in delight. \"Velin always kept a personal copy of Ragnarok's database while we were there. It has a huge list of contact information for pro-players. I bet she invited them to apply.\"\"That sounds super legal,\" said Oberlin, smirking.\"That reminds me.\" Ignoring him, Thorn turned to Corvo. \"I never did ask you what class you have. Are you planning on joining us in the crusade?\"\"I wasn't, no. I think you would be better suited to run a full combat team. I have the Veiled Jester class. It gives me almost no advantage for combat. If you are taking Velin, you will have enough brains for strategy, and she can fight, so I thought I would hang out with Oberlin and learn the ropes. He was telling me about what you're doing to set up an intelligence network, and I think it is pretty brilliant. I'd love to be involved there.\"\"Intelligence network?\" Athena raised her eyebrows. \"Why haven't I heard about this?\"\"State secrets.\" Thorn said, trying to keep his face straight. \"Haha, actually, it isn't anything solid yet. I met a really interesting individual who works for an organization in the south, and we've been working together to figure out how we can set up a network like Avalon's. Once its operating, I'll let you know.\"\"That's my boy. Who are you working with?\"\"Josephine. She is a Shadow Priest that works for the Ordo Serpentes.\"\"Whoa, you didn't tell me you were working with Josephine.\" Corvo looked at Oberlin accusingly. \"You just said you were working with the Order. I'm surprised by that, most of the other Avatars are not quick to work with other people. How did you get connected with her?\"\"Um. After we fought, when Oberlin got his soul statue thing back, she sent me a friend request.\"\"You fought?\" Athena looked at her nephew, a tinge of surprise flashing across her eyes. \"Avatars are tough opponents.\"\"Yeah. After she realized she couldn't win, she let us take Oberlin's soul.\" Thorn's eyes met Corvo's, and he could see the wheels turning as the avatar of Huginn thought over what he had just said. \"Anyway, she sent me a friend request, and I pitched the idea of an information exchange network. That is what Oberlin has been working on. But, since you are here, if Oberlin doesn't mind, we can hand that off to you.\" Thorn looked at the slim thief.\"That is fine by me,\" Oberlin smiled, his relief showing clearly on his face. \"I'd much rather go exploring and look for loot, or something, than handle all that paperwork. Besides,\" the thief shuddered, \"working with Snake Lady creeps me out.\"His head lowered, Corvo stared down at his feet as he bit on the end of his finger. The room was quiet for a few minutes as Thorn and the others let him think. Nodding to himself, Corvo smacked his fist into his palm and looked up with determination.\"I'll do it. Josephine and I have a long history, so I think I'll be able to work well with her. Is she part of the team yet? If not, can I offer her a contract? I think she would take it with the right conditions.\"\"Can she be part of the guild without the Ordo Serpentes knowing?\" Thorn asked, his brow furrowing. \"It wouldn't be good if she was outed and lost her status in the Order.\"\"Don't worry about that. Membership in a group like the Ordo Serpentes doesn't block you from being in a guild. Plus, we can make her a secret member. Let me talk to her and figure out the best path.\"\"Sure, that sounds good. We'd be happy to have her if you can make it work. Feel free to give her the same conditions as any other team member. As for running with our combat team, I'm sure we'll have enough people for that. I'm thinking that between me, Mina, and Velin we have a solid core. We could probably use a scout and another pure damage dealer.\"\"Um!\" Jumping to her feet, Mina suddenly stopped as all eyes turned to her. Her excitement gave way to embarrassment, and she sat back down on the couch slowly.\"Do you have an idea?\"\"Um...\" Hesitating, Mina stammered for a while, before swallowing and blurting out, \"what about Jorge?\" As soon as the words came out of her mouth, she froze, watching carefully for Thorn's reaction. Even though she and Velin had worked through their conflict with Thorn, Jorge was a different matter. After all, he had been the one to do the actual stabbing when their group betrayed Thorn, and Thorn had retaliated in kind when he and Jorge met again. \"What about Jorge?\" Mina asked again.  \"I think he would be a strong addition to the team. He would make a good scout and his damage output is pretty high. I don't have any issue if you want to reach out to him.\" \"You should also try to find players that are familiar with the battlefield.\" Finishing her wine, Athena put her glass on the side table. \"There are probably a number of pro players that Velin recruited that have a lot of experience with the crusades. Actually, I would assume that anyone who has been part of a big guild has run their fair share of crusades. Mina, would you agree?\"\"Yeah, we ran crusades for about six months. One of the other leaders of Ragnarok was responsible for grinding rep so, apart from Jorge, who was one of the scouts for the other team leader, we did not spend a whole lot of time on it. But the map does not change at all, so having someone who knows it is a great idea.\"\"Exactly.\" Nodding, Athena fixed her eyes on Thorn. \"Having someone who is familiar with the map will give you an advantage. You also want someone who can walk you through the basics of the crusades since they are a little different from the regular game world.\" \"Do you want to come? I would love it if you would come quest with us.\" \"Aw, hun, I would really love to go with you, but I have way too much work to do here. I'm already stretching it as it is.\" Seeing Thorn's frown, Athena rose and walked over to where he sat on his boulder, putting her arms as far around him as she could. \"I have a couple deals to work out, but I already told the board that I'll be taking a long vacation in a couple weeks. I think I can manage three weeks off, so I will come and play with you then. Alright?\"\"That would be really fun.\" Thorn brightened up again at the thought of getting to spend time with his aunt. \"That is almost six months. That will be really nice.\"Reaching up, Athena stood on her tiptoes to ruffle Thorn's hair and gave him a kiss on his broad cheek. He was blooming into a fine young man, and the freedom and responsibility that Nova Terra brought to his life was doing wonders for him. \"It has been so good to see you. I'm really proud of you and everything you've achieved, Thorn. Keep me posted on how things are going, okay?\"\"Thanks.\" Smiling warmly at Athena, Thorn stood up and stretched, his fingers brushing the ceiling. \"Is everyone else good to go? Anything you need to take care of before we head back?\"\"Nope, I'm good,\" Oberlin said, looking at Corvo and Mina, who both shook their heads.\"Okay, then let's head back.\" Giving Athena one last peck on the cheek, Thorn led the others out of the city, taking the floating pagoda down to the surface of the lake. The night was dark, but to Thorn it was as bright as the daytime, so he led the way back toward the valley. Players had the advantage of being able to stay up for days at a time, which allowed them to cover greater distances than if they only traveled during the day. Beginning the long journey back, Thorn moderated his pace to match Mina's speed. The short Ice Witch's travel spell was surprisingly fast, considering she was a pure magic class. Creating a path of ice, she was able to slide along it as if she were wearing ice skates. Slower than her teleportation ability, it could be maintained much longer, allowing them to travel for three hours before she had to rest to recharge her mana. Oberlin and Corvo, while not as fast as Thorn, had no trouble keeping up. Corvo's cloak spread into the shape of wings, and in a flash of feathers, he transformed into a raven that flew above the party's heads. Thorn could only assume that the ability came from Corvo's avatar title, like Thorn's armor. Oberlin was even stranger. Small golden flashes appeared under his feet as he walked, each step blinking him six feet forward.With no special travel abilities since he was not near any other disciples, Thorn just ran, his long legs allowing him to keep pace. Together they traveled back to Fang Valley, reaching the pass into the valley after four days of rapid travel. Velin and Captain Del'har stood waiting for them at the entrance to the citadel.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Are you interested in reading the rest of Book #3?

Come explore the world of Nova Terra and help me determine where the story goes.You can find out more about me at www.sethring.com", "\"Welcome back, my Lord.\" Captain Del'har executed a neat bow, his fist over his heart. Behind him, Velin mimicked the bow, a small smile on her face. Gesturing for them to stand up straight, Thorn took in the Moon Wolf Citadel. The gates stood open, travelers and natives alike streaming in and out. Robed disciples stood by the gate, watching the people entering and exiting, their eyes peeled for anyone causing trouble.[Master! Master! You came back!] Bounding across the wall, a small red blur dashed toward Thorn, launching itself through the air and landing on his shoulder. Bouncing up and down in excitement, Akira waved her tails. [You were gone for so long!]\"Hi, Akira. How are you doing? Were you able to invite your family?\" Before Thorn left, Akira had mentioned going to find her family and bringing them back to the valley. Since she would just be unsummoned if she died, Thorn said that was fine and let her go off on her own.[I did. I found my mom and dad and my first brother Sid and his wife Amil, and his wife Gella, and his wife Tem, and their kids, Mosha, Gel, Mille, Evera, Thirl, Vannes,...] Continuing to list the names of her family one after the other, Akira was still going minutes later. After she had finished with her first brother, his three wives, their twenty-six kids, all of their uncles and the families of her first brother's wives, Akira began to list her second brother's family. Stunned, Thorn opened up his [Region Management Screen] and clicked on the population tab. Countless notifications jumped out at him, but sliding through them, he found the one he wanted. Three hundred and eighty-eight Ailuridae had followed Akira back to the valley, leaving their home to settle down in the forest outside the Moon Wolf Citadel. According to Akira, they would spread over the valley, providing an opportunity for players and natives alike to tame them. Royal Ailuridae were rare, since they required two Royal Ailuridae parents, but even the normal Ailuridae made good support type battle pets. Pulling out a pastry from his inventory, Thorn gave it to Akira, distracting her from her recitation of her whole extended family. Excited, Akira grabbed the pastry and wolfed it down as Thorn stroked her fur. Handing her another after she had finished the first, Thorn pulled up the Population tab. His screen filled with information and it took awhile for Thorn to make sense of what he was looking at. The [RMS] not only showed the total population of the valley, but even broke down the significant racial groups, showed the distribution of occupations, and listed the guilds that had officially set up residence in the valley.The Caldorian Chamber of Commerce, popularly referred to as 3C, was a guild of merchants that focused on making money. As soon as word of the citadel had spread, they sent a representative to ask for an office space. Happy to have them, Velin had arranged for them to rent one of the storefronts in the merchant quarter. Right behind them, a representative from Silver Fist arrived. Another merchant guild, Velin gave them the same treatment. Already goods were starting to arrive, and the merchant's quarters were bustling.The Children of Avalon had also arrived, even appearing before the two merchant guilds. Their representative had shown up the morning after Ouroboros was killed, knocking on the gates of the Moon Wolf Citadel. After taking a walk around the open parts of the citadel, he had asked for a place to rent and set up a little shop with a sign that simply read, \"Avalon\".Since Thorn had left, the population of the valley had exploded as players flooded in to play as Wolfkin. In the three weeks since the race had opened, over 170,000 players had spawned in the valley as Wolfkin. According to Velin, that number would likely have multiplied by ten if the system had not initiated a queue. Rather than dumping close to two million players in the same space, the game staggered their arrival to help improve player experience.Even with the queue, Thorn was watching the number climb. The number of natives in the valley was also growing at an astonishing rate. To help deal with the massive influx of players, the system would spawn natives, adding a new native for every twenty-five players. This helped balance the user experience and prevented areas from being overwhelmed.Flicking through the other tabs, Thorn saw that the valley's economy was booming. There was a distinct lack of specialized mineral resources, forcing the smiths that had begun work to import metal at a great cost. Making a note to send someone to look for mines, Thorn walked through the large gates and into Moon Wolf Citadel.As he entered, the Wolfkin guard snapped to attention at the sight of Captain Del'har. Looking around, Thorn did not see one face he recognized. The majority of the guards were disciples of the Temple of the Moon, but they had all joined since he had left the citadel for the capital. A large number of the players that spawned as Wolfkin had immediately joined the temple, taking on the role of disciples. These disciples were spread around the valley as they worked to improve their particular class.Thorn had expected to see a large influx of players, but nothing had prepared him for just how many joined the temple. It wasn't until Velin explained the lure of a class with a clear upgrade that he was able to wrap his head around the disciples flooding the valley. It was all quite overwhelming.Making their way to the fortress, Thorn asked the captain to get Elder Havva and then sat down in the Wolf Throne with a satisfied sigh. He had been sitting on a giant boulder for most of the last three weeks and was quite glad to get to sit on an actual seat. Mina, Oberlin, Velin, and Corvo arranged themselves around the throne, waiting for the captain to come back.\"Velin, judging by the number of people who have chosen to play Wolfkin and the popularity of the Disciple class, we might need to rework our plan. Originally, the idea was to require that Night Walkers become members of our guild in order to get the advancement stone. I'm not so sure that is a good idea. I don't think we can support a million players.\"\"You are correct. It did not occur to me that the Disciple class has four nearly guaranteed advancement paths. We can't prevent players from joining the Temple of the Moon, making putting a restriction on getting the class difficult. Additionally, it will be almost impossible for us to keep the advancement stones to ourselves since we don't know if there are other sources in the mountains. Instead, I suggest we follow the example of the old Temple of the Moon.\"\"Hm? What did they do?\"\"Before the temple retreated from the valley, the Wolfkin had a significant population. Because almost all of the young Wolfkin went through the temple, a special category of Night Walker was created. The Night Walkers who stayed in the valley were called Moon Guardians, and they were responsible for protecting the valley and the temple. The rest of the Night Walkers were sent into the world, tasked with hunting down evil and cleansing the night.\"\"I see. That would certainly work. Would we be able to add an oath that the Night Walkers would have to help protect the valley?\"\"Possibly. You have to be careful with that sort of thing as few players enjoy being restricted like that.\" Velin flipped open her notebook, reading over a few notes. \"It might be more effective to create a loose organization instead, as players will see that as bringing them value.\"\"Sort of like an inner sect, outer sect sort of thing?\" Corvo, quite interested in the conversation, jumped in.\"Inner sect? Explain that, please?\" Thorn looked between the two strategists.\"An inner sect would be the core organization. Tighter rules, better rewards. The outer sect is the opposite. Loose rules, fewer rewards.\"\"Correct.\" Velin tucked a wisp of hair behind her ear. \"We could use Nova Luna as the inner sect. All Moon Guardians are required to join as social players, with the potential to test into the professional team. This will encourage players who have ambitions of playing Nova Terra for a living while providing a path for those who just want to quest around the valley.\"\"At the same time, we create a loose organization for the Night Walkers who will be leaving the valley. In fact, we can just call it the Night Walkers Association or something simple. Players who want to become a Night Walker will get a free upgrade stone, just like the Moon Guardians, but they will be free to leave the valley.\" Corvo looked at Velin, who nodded for him to continue. \"However, rather than just let them leave, we provide benefits. We are setting up an intelligence network, right? It wouldn't be hard to connect it with the Night Walkers and allow them to benefit each other. We can also give Night Walkers discounted prices on goods, provide professional services at a reduced rate, all sorts of things.\"\"So it will be more like a club than anything else?\" Thorn cupped his chin in his palm, leaning on the armrest of the Wolf Throne.\"Correct.\" Velin nodded, taking over the conversation. \"But we can make the rules include coming to the defense of other Night Walkers. If we play it right, we'll be able to mobilize groups of Night Walkers when we need to.\"\"Hmm. Did you two talk about this before?\"Looking at each other, Corvo and Velin both smiled, the avatar of the All-Seeing Raven broadly, and the Elven War Priestess very slightly. Looking back at Thorn, they both spoke at the same time.\"No, it is just obvious.\"\"Haha, okay, okay.\" Thorn held up his hands in defeat as Oberlin murmured something about Elven telepathy. \"Let's do that. I'll leave the details for the two of you to figure out. Velin, Oberlin asked to be released from his position as spymaster, so Corvo will be taking that over. He is also available if you need help with administrative stuff. Though it looks like you are handling everything really well.\"\"The ladies from the Society of Roses have been a huge help in that regard.\"\"Be that as it may, I think what you have done is incredibly impressive. There have been nearly no snags at all, despite the fact that almost 200,000 people flooded the valley this past couple weeks. Well done.\"\"Thank you, Thorn.\" Even though Velin's face remained calm, her eyes sparkled with warmth. \"Anything else we need to deal with, planning wise?\"\"I've got some boxes to open.\" Oberlin raised his hand. \"I have not had a spare moment to work on those six chests that we took from Angdrin, and I'm itching to give them a go. They'll take a while to crack, but I have a good feeling about them.\"\"What about the crusade?\" Mina chimed in, her eagerness written clearly across her face. \"I want to come. Velin, are you going to come, too?\"\"I think I will pass. There is much to do here. Plus, it would be better to start working with the professional team we recruited for Nova Luna. There are a lot of great players that applied, so we should use them. I'm sure most of them know their way around the Battlefield of Flame and Shadow, as well.\"\"Alright, that sounds good. We still need to do the final tests for the professional team, right?\" Seeing Velin nod, Thorn sighed. \"I also need to go start my training for my class. I'm a Disciple of the temple, so I shouldn't skip out on training. Too much to do.\"\"Better to be busy than bored.\" Oberlin laughed. Standing, he waved and headed for the door. \"Well, I'm off to get working on the locks. Call me if you need me.\"\"I'm going to go with him. I've got some questions about the network.\" Nodding to Thorn, Corvo followed the thief out.\"I'm going to get an Ailuridae!\" yelled Mina as she dashed from the room, leaving Velin and Thorn staring at each other. As Mina ran out of the doors, she nearly bumped into Captain Del'har, who was bringing Elder Havva to the Throne Room. Shouting a quick apology, she ran down the hall and jumped down the stairs, calling for Akira to follow her. The furry Ailuridae climbed down from where she had perched on Thorn's shoulder and scampered out of the throne room after the Ice Witch, nodding to Elder Havva as she passed him.Making way for the little red creature, the two Wolfkin could not help but smile. Akira was a cute little thing, and her slightly stuck up ways just added to her charm. Entering the throne room, the captain saluted, while Elder Havva just waved as Thorn began to stand. \"Sit, sit. Lord Greymane, you must learn to behave as your position demands. It is not my place to correct your behavior, but I hope you will treat my words as those of a concerned elder. Your position is such that the only person you should rise for is a noble ranked above you. When we are in the temple, you can pay the proper respect as befits your identity as a disciple, but in your own hall you must maintain your dignity.\"\"Thank you, Elder. I will take your words to heart.\" Despite how much it bothered him to accept the respect of someone so much older than himself, Thorn knew that Elder Havva's words were right. Growing up, he had been largely insulated from this sort of thing by his aunt, but she had warned him countless times that he could not avoid acting according to his position. Now, his position was that of the lord of the valley, and standing to greet Elder Havva was not acceptable.\"Good, I am glad to hear that. I must admit, I have been surprised to see how many of our people have returned home. Truly, the blessing of Hati has returned to this land. We failed as the Moon Guardians, yet you have restored the honor of the Wolfkin. Thank you.\"\"It is my honor and duty, Elder. Now, to business. The great number of new disciples in the valley is certainly a blessing, but handled poorly, it could become a disaster. I'll let Velin fill you in, but we have some ideas for how we could make sure that things do not get out of hand.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Are you interested in reading the rest of Book #3?

They decided to offer three different paths to new Wolfkin players. First, players were always free to play the game on their own, and to ensure that no bad feelings were built up, the Temple of the Moon would offer a quest for the shining silver moonstones used for advancing the Disciple class. The quest would serve as the typical advancement quest, allowing a player to build reputation with the temple, which would unlock the ability to purchase moon stones.The other two paths would tie the player to the temple, automatically granting them the Disciple class and guaranteeing a free moon stone for advancing when they were ready. When they had completed their training, the players would be given the choice of becoming a member of the Night Walkers and leaving the valley, or staying as a Moon Guardian. As both groups were still tied to the Temple of the Moon, they would be able to build up the influence of the temple as more players joined.It was not until he heard these plans being made that Thorn realized just how much of an advantage he had gained in becoming Lord Greymane. The Wolfkin race was a tremendous asset, and it would only continue to grow as players chose to play as Wolfkin. Thorn had initially expected some resistance from Elder Havva, but the Wolfkin elder had thrown his full support behind the idea, even making some suggestions that would tie the players to the temple even tighter.\"Oh, Elder Havva, I meant to ask. As I was on the way back from the capital, I realized that [Pack Travel] doesn't work with other people in my guild. It only works on those with the disciple class. I was wondering because when we were on our way back from the old village to the valley it seemed like all of the Wolfkin had it. Is it a Wolfkin Racial ability?\"\"No, it is an ability of the Dawn Court. As you advance in your Disciple class, your ability will grow, allowing you to grant the bonus to anyone in a group with you.\" The elderly Wolfkin wagged his finger at Thorn. \"You would know this if you trained your class properly.\"\"Haha, yeah.\" Embarrassed, Thorn scratched the back of his neck and changed the subject. \"Velin, are there any other issues you see with our plan?\"\"No, I think it is tight enough as it is. We can always adjust if any issues crop up.\" Velin looked over her notes and shook her head. \"I'm going to go deal with the second round of selection for the professional team. You should come down when you are done here.\"\"Will do. Thanks.\"Velin left to gather the players who had passed the first rounds of selection for the guild's professional team while Thorn talked to Elder Havva and Captain Del'har about the citadel. Saluting, the captain handed over a report and began to talk about everything that had happened over the last few weeks.\"My Lord, we have had no major incidents during the time you were gone. Thanks to the disciples of the Temple of the Moon, our security has been excellent, and we have been able to release the soldiers back to their previous occupations. As you instructed, we have established the Freemen as an independent patrol group in the valley and established a Town Watch in Greymane village. Elder Thomas has been doing a good job organizing the village, though it is quickly growing beyond the wall due to the influx of travelers and natives.\"He has also requested that a second town be constructed, or that the town be expanded substantially. Additionally, he has petitioned that some space in the valley be set aside for farming. It would undoubtedly be best if you met with him. We have also categorized the resources produced in the valley, which you can see in the report, and have begun setting up trading agreements with the merchants who have arrived. The merchants and guilds who have applied for residence in the citadel have been settled, and the non-combat guild members that Nova Luna has recruited have also been organized.\"\"How has the non-combat part of the guild been organized?\"\"The majority of the non-combat members of Nova Luna hold production or support classes, my Lord. They have been assigned space in the crafting quarter or the merchant quarter. Lady Velin organized them into groups and has assigned them a variety of tasks to help support the guild.\"\"Thank you, Captain. You've done a good job. I'll look over the report and get back to you if I have any special instructions.\" Putting the report away, Thorn looked over at Elder Havva. \"Elder, I will be reporting to morning training once I have settled the matters of the guild and will plan on coming to speak to you after that, if you will be available.\"\"I'll wait to see you then.\" The elderly Wolfkin waved. After bidding goodbye to Thorn and the captain, he shuffled out of the room, leaving the two of them to continue their conversation. Thorn stood up and stretched out to his full height. \"Alright, we can leave everything else for later. Let's go catch up with Velin. I could use your help with the tests.\" \"Yes, my Lord.\" Saluting again, the captain followed behind Thorn as they went to see what Velin was doing.Outside, in one of the large yards, Velin stood in front of a group of 250 players. \"Thank you all for your application to Nova Luna.\" Velin looked over the crowd of players that had passed through the initial professional team test. \"Everyone here has passed the first round of the application process and is now officially a member of the professional team of the guild. As we discussed at the beginning of the process, we are now going to test for the two active teams. Initially, our active teams will be comprised of the top one hundred players in the professional team split into two groups. The top fifty players will form the First Raid Group, while the second fifty will belong to the Second Raid Group. We are also forming a special group, initially limited to twenty people, led by our guild leader, that anyone can apply to join. The rest of the players will form the reserve team. \"Every two weeks there will be a test, allowing for players on the reserve team to replace players on the active teams. Reserve members are eligible for spots on the Second Raid Group, while members of the Second Raid Group are eligible to compete for the fifty spots in the First Raid Group.\" Taking a breath, Velin looked around, only to see that everyone's attention was fixed on Thorn, who had just entered. With a sigh, she gestured toward him. \"As you have noticed, our guild leader has arrived. \"This is Thorn. He is the guild leader of Nova Luna. He also holds the title of Baron Greymane, the Moon Wolf. In addition to the first and second raid groups, we will also be forming a special guard unit that will fall under the guild leader's direct command and will be responsible for grinding crusade rep, among other things. There are currently ten slots in the guild leader's guard, though that number will increase with time. Guild leader, would you like to say a few words?\"\"Sure.\" Unbothered by the eyes of over two hundred and fifty professional players fixed on him, Thorn walked to the front of the room. \"Hello. As Velin said, my name is Thorn. We are very excited to have all of you here as we begin to build Nova Luna's professional team. With such a strong group of players we are, without a doubt, fated for great things in Nova Terra. Our goal for the first few months is to get used to working together, and I hope you will put all your effort into that. We have a wonderful home that is full of resources and opportunities, and by combining our efforts, we will be able to grow beyond anything you can currently imagine.\"I'm sure you have all explored Moon Wolf Citadel over the last few days. This is our home base, and Fang Valley is where we will be focusing our initial efforts. There are ruins in the mountains to the east, on the other side of the valley, and plenty of interesting things to do in the valley itself. The development of our First Raid Group will focus on the ruins, while the Second Raid Group will focus on exploring the valley and clearing out the corrupted wolf dens.\"Our backer, Atlas Energy, is expecting big things from us and will be investing heavily to establish a stronghold in Nova Terra. We are the front line of that effort. The tip of the spear, if you will. Nova Luna's plans are two-fold. First, we intend to focus a large part of our efforts on establishing trade using the citadel as our base. Part of that effort will include supporting merchants with escort squads that will act as guards for any merchant whose caravan passes through the citadel. Second, we will develop our professional team into a strong contender for dungeon records and competing on the various battlefields.\"As Velin mentioned, we will be forming three groups initially, and a reserve force. The First Raiding Group will be called the Deimos squad, while the second group will be called the Phobos squad. In the future, it is likely that we will expand the number of squads, but for now we are going to operate with just two. If you don't make it into one of the squads in this first round, don't worry. There will be plenty of opportunity moving forward.\"Taking a deep breath and pausing for a moment to let his words sink in, Thorn continued.\"The strength of Nova Luna will lie in unity. We are forging an elite but united group, focusing on adaptability and power. Our goal is to develop into a guild that no one will dream of crossing, establishing ourselves as the primary power in the Ironhold Duchy. From there we will expand across the continent, growing until we claim the spot of number one.\"I recognize that Nova Luna is a newcomer to the game, and many people doubt that we will be able to compete with the major guilds. Some players may even be laughing at us. They don't think that a newly established guild will be able to handle the pressure. Maybe they think that we will not be able to hold on. We will prove them wrong, not using empty words, but with our actions.\"As Thorn spoke, his warm, rich voice bounced around the room, bringing a comfortable feeling to everyone who heard it. Players found themselves nodding along as he described his vision for the guild. Standing next to him, even Velin found herself moved by the image his words formed, as if a beautiful picture was being painted before her, drawing her in.Realizing what was happening, Velin was reminded of the effect of Ouroboros' aura. Yet Thorn's words gave a different feeling than Ouroboros' had. The Exalted Devil Blood Berserker's words had an insidious effect, appearing at first glance to be gentle and considerate but carrying an underlying coldness that made the listener fearful. Thorn's words were rougher, less polished, yet they held firm strength and a warmth that inspired. As Velin looked over the faces of the players that had made it through the first round of tests, it was obvious from their enraptured expressions how Thorn's words had captured them.As he finished speaking, the players talked quietly among themselves, their eyes shining with excitement for the future. None of them had ever experienced being part of a super guild in the top 10, so hearing Thorn's plans to grow Nova Luna into a behemoth ignited their passion. When they had first received the invitation to apply to Nova Luna, many had been skeptical, but between seeing Moon Wolf Citadel and the conditions of the professional team contracts, they each were convinced to apply. Energized by Thorn's words, the players followed Velin's direction and split into five groups of fifty that lined up to wait outside of the yard. Selecting five numbers at random, Velin called them out and five players, one from each group, reentered the yard, their combat gear equipped. Calling another group of five, she gestured for them to face off.\"The test is simple,\" Velin said, standing in front of the five players, \"you have sixty seconds to organize, and then you'll be fighting against each other. We've already done the single combat assessments, so our goal here is to determine how you fight in a group. You will be rated on how you adapt to this situation. You may begin.\"Immediately both teams looked at each other in dismay. The first group panicked, drawing their weapons, but the second group was calmer. A bearded priest stepped back from the group, and called out in a low voice, \"Sivir, Frost Priest, DPS and Control.\"Their eyes lighting up, the rest of the group quietly gave their names, classes and specialties, getting into formation according to their roles. A sharp eyed archer from the other team saw what they were doing and copied, prompting his team to do the same. Just as the last person finished announcing their class, Velin waved her hand.\"Start!\"Both teams immediately burst into action, the melee fighters dashing toward each other while the spellcasters began to chant their spells. One of the teams had a rogue who tried to fade from view, only to be highlighted in a glowing red light by the sharp-eyed archer. Just as the archer was about to shoot his bow at the rogue, a sense of danger came over him and he tumbled backward, barely avoiding being engulfed by a whirling globe of snow and sleet.Freed from the marking effect, the rogue tossed a thankful look at the Frost Priest and vanished. Cursing, the archer yelled for his team to be careful and began releasing arrows at the other team. Watching from the side with fascination, Thorn tried to take in as much as possible. All ten of the combatants were elite players and were quite evenly matched. Eventually, the rogue managed to ambush one of the casters on the archer's team, and the Frost Priest's team squeezed out a victory.Using the training yard's controls to revive everyone and restore their health, Velin thanked the players and told them the results would come out the next afternoon after the third round of tests. After they left, she called in the next group and repeated the performance. Throughout the afternoon and evening, group after group came in and fought against each other. Thorn and Captain Del'har watched the fights closely, reporting their thoughts to Velin, who kept track of everything. Part way through the fights, Mina ran in with Akira, holding another Ailuridae that had agreed to contract with her.Showing it off proudly to Thorn, she was about to leave when Velin grabbed her and made her assess the new members of the professional team. Grumbling, she took a clipboard and made notes while her Ailuridae played with Akira. \"Why are they all so bad?\" Mina whined after the last team had fought.\"I don't think they were that bad.\" Thorn patted her on the head. \"Sure, they could use polishing, but at least their basics were solid.\" \"Ha, I bet I could take on both teams any day of the week,\" she boasted, swatting Thorn's hand away.\"Mmmm. Good. That can be the next test.\" Velin nodded, writing in her notebook.\"Wait? What?! No, no, we don't need to do that.\" \"You can help, as well.\" Ignoring her friend, Velin looked at Thorn.\"Aww. Me and my big mouth,\" Mina grumbled as Thorn chuckled on the side.\"This is so you can get used to fighting alongside Thorn. Being familiar with each other's level of combat ability will help with cohesion. Thorn, you are responsible for determining the other three people you will take with you on your first crusade. Overall, you will be picking a squad of twenty, which will cover your first two advancements. Remember, the primary focus of your team is survivability, alright? The crusade is quite chaotic, and the most important thing is making it till the end.\" Nodding, Thorn could not help but smile. He had a feeling he was going to like the Battlefield of Flame and Shadow.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Are you interested in reading the rest of Book #3?

Once everyone had arrived, Thorn stepped out to address them.\"Good morning. Thanks to your excellent results yesterday, it was quite a chore to divide you into the three squads. As we mentioned yesterday, we are also forming a special Titan squad. The Titan squad will be under my direct command. Initially, there will be twenty slots in the squad, and we will be working on grinding crusade rep for the Order of the Flame. Unlike the other squads, this one will not have a rotating membership. Instead, if you are interested, you can volunteer to be part of it. Anyone who wants to try out can stay for testing. If not, no pressure. We will be announcing the squad lineups this afternoon.\"The two requirements for being part of the Titan squad are a level of familiarity with the crusade battlefields and being eligible for the professional team. Since you are still here, you fill the requirements. Unlike the two other squads and the reserve force, the Titan squad will be a purely combat squad. Don't expect to explore ruins or dive dungeons regularly. Instead, you will also serve as the official enlisted force registered under Baron Greymane. In the future, this squad will be responsible for fighting as part of the Imperial Army, should there be a mustering call.\"For a couple moments the players were silent, looking at each other, until one person stepped forward, pushing through the crowd, all the while looking warily at Thorn. Recognizing the sharp-eyed archer from the day before, Thorn waited for him to speak.\"I don't mean any disrespect, guild leader, but I think most of us would like to find out who we'll be working with if we join this Titan squad.\"\"Hmm? Ah, you mean you want to see me fight?\"\"Yeah. We came because we know Velin and respect what she is capable of. Mina as well. And you certainly look like you hit like a truck. But we have our pride. Joining the raiding groups is fine, since we'll be playing with others who are on our level, but if you are taking command of a squad, it would be nice if you could show us what you can do.\" Despite any nervousness he felt, the archer faced Thorn directly, stating his opinion.\"Great idea.\" Thorn's lips curled slightly. \"How about the same as yesterday? Form a team of five to fight. Your opponent will be me and Mina.\"\"Um...\" Seeing awkward looks appearing on the faces of the players, Thorn looked down at Mina in confusion, only to see her grinning smugly.\"Mina could probably take any five of them by herself,\" Velin said quietly, not looking up from her notebook where she was writing. Flipping the cover shut, she avoided looking at the already embarrassed players, instead fixing her gaze on Mina. \"Despite her size and normal comportment, Mina is quite skilled in PvP.\"\"Okay, then I can just face them myself?\" Thorn scratched his head, still unable to wrap his head around someone being afraid of Mina.\"Hey, why don't you fight me?\" Annoyed that Thorn was underestimating her, Mina pulled out her wand and poked him in the side. \"I'll show you what real PvP looks like.\"\"Um. I don't know, I don't want to hurt you,\" said Thorn sheepishly.In the stunned silence that followed, Thorn could almost see the ice forming around Mina's feet as the temperature abruptly plummeted. Glaring at him, she marched over to one side of the yard and pointed her wand at him. \"Just don't go crying to your aunt when I spank you.\"\"Haha, okay, okay.\" Laughing helplessly, Thorn faced her and summoned his armor. Flexing the claws on his left hand, he gripped his tetsubo in his right. \"Careful Mina. I won't be pulling punches.\"\"That's my line.\" With a wave of her wand, three blue globes appeared, flying in orbit around her pointy hat.Along the side of the yard, the players looked on, talking quietly to each other. Stepping forward, Sivir, the Frost Priest, stood next to the archer. \"How do you rate the guild leader's chances?\"\"Him? He's big, but that just means he is going to get hit more. His armor is imposing, but Mina won't care about that. I heard he is a single category disciple, too. So he is pretty much outgunned in every way.\"\"I dunno, he seems pretty confident.\" Sivir rubbed his chin. \"And Velin doesn't seem too worried, either.\"\"Nah, that's just her face. She's always ice cold.\"Velin opened to a new page in her notebook and looked at Mina and Thorn to see if they were ready to fight. Lifting her hand, she slowly counted down.\"Three, two, one. Fight!\"As soon as the first sound of the word \"fight\" left her lips, Mina had already burst into action, her form blurring as she darted directly toward Thorn. One of the revolving blue orbs rose into the air and stopped in place, the moisture in the air around it compressing and twisting into razor sharp ice spikes. Sliding forward on a path of ice, Mina abruptly changed directions as the ice spikes shot forward toward Thorn, who spun his tetsubo to knock them away. Just as he was about to turn to his right to face her, Thorn noticed that the orb was creating more ice spikes.Stepping to his left, Thorn was startled when the ice spikes rotated as well, aiming right at him. Just then, the second orb rose into the air, fixing in place on the other side of Thorn. Ice spikes began to manifest around that orb as well, sandwiching Thorn. Frowning under his helmet, Thorn was about to jump forward to try and knock one of the orbs down when he heard a voice behind him.\"[Sub Zero!]\" While he had been distracted by the floating orbs, Mina slid around behind his back, surrounding him on three sides. As soon as he began to move one direction, she cast her spell, causing the temperature around him to instantly fall well below zero. The abrupt shift in temperature shocked his body, causing him to lose control of it for a moment. Seeing the warning flashing, Thorn didn't need to turn around to know that he was about to get hit by an attack. Before the blinking indicator had disappeared, Mina cast her next spell.\"[Avalanche!]\"Above Thorn's head, a runic circle appeared, summoning a ton of snow and slush to collapse down onto him. Peppered with ice spikes that glanced off of his chest, arms, and head, Thorn had never felt more grateful for the full body armor that his [Avatar of the Wolf] ability granted him. The spikes left dents and scratches on his silver armor, but Thorn was relieved that they did not make it to his skin. As the effect of [Sub Zero] wore off, Thorn started to struggle free from the effects of the [Avalanche] spell, when Mina's voice sounded again.\"[Raging Blizzard!]\" Instantly the wet and heavy snow that surrounded Thorn rose into the air, creating a raging maelstrom of razor sharp ice. Encased in a bubble of deadly snow, Thorn had no way of seeing the ice spikes that continued to shoot toward him, putting him in a completely passive position. Watching from the side, Sivir sighed. It was obvious that the guild leader had underestimated Mina and was now paying the price. Around him, players were starting to grumble quietly. After all, no professional player would be content working for someone who was weak. Stealing a glance, Sivir noticed that Velin's expression had not changed one bit, and rather than writing in her notebook, she was looking dispassionately at the fight. Hearing gasps from the players around him, the Frost Priest turned his eyes back to the fight, only to be stunned by what he saw.So far, Mina successfully held the initiative in the fight, forcing Thorn into a passive position. Yet, as her combo played out flawlessly, the Ice Witch could not shake a dangerous feeling. Her casts were executed perfectly with impeccable timing, each building on the last to what should have been devastating effect. At this point in the fight, Thorn should have been off balance and trapped by the whirling storm of ice and sleet.About to release her final coup de grace, Mina lifted her wand when an abrupt feeling of danger flashed across her mind and she abandoned the spell, teleporting backward. Just as she was about to vanish, two red, glowing eyes appeared from the globe of swirling snow, fixed on her. Disappearing from where she stood and appearing twenty feet away, Mina gulped as she saw a massive metal club smashed into the ground where she had stood a split second before.Moving so fast that it looked like he teleported, Thorn appeared, gripping the handle of his tetsubo. As soon as the stunned condition had worn off, Thorn had sensed the danger he was in and activated [Wolf's Rage], increasing his speed and strength. His hot breath curled up from his helmet, shrouding his glowing red eyes in mist. With a roar, he launched himself forward, his tetsubo smashing into the ground as Mina slid away. Despite dodging the blow, chunks of stone flew through the air, nearly knocking the petite witch down. \"[Ice Wall!]\" Shouting out her defensive spell, Mina tried to create some space between herself and Thorn, only to see his form blur and pass through the walls as if they were not there. Bearing down on Mina like a freight train, Thorn's tetsubo glowed with a red mist, and he stabbed it forward like a spear. Mina, dodging to the side, hurriedly cast [Sub Zero] again, trying to slow Thorn down.The spell hit and Thorn froze solid, but just before he lost control of his movement, he flicked his wrist and his tetsubo whirled out, catching Mina off-guard. Despite her best effort to dodge out of the way, the edge of the weapon clipped her shoulder, throwing her from her feet. The red mist that had pulsed around the club shifted onto Mina's shoulder and she could feel her health beginning to drain. \"[Clean as Ice.]\" Gritting her teeth, Mina hurried to cast a spell to stop the bleeding effect that Thorn's charging strike had applied to her. Unfortunately, doing so did not give her time to scramble back up from where she had fallen. With a gutteral snarl, Thorn's eyes flashed bright red after less than a second of being unable to move, and he leaped forward, his clawed fingers burying themselves into the stone next to Mina's head.\"Thorn wins!\" Quickly declaring the victor, Velin ended the fight, restoring both Mina and Thorn to their perfect state.Chuckling happily, Thorn helped Mina up as he dismissed his armor. Frustrated, she punched him as hard as she could, causing him to chuckle even louder.\"That is not fair! You must be cheating! [Sub Zero] is a five second stun. How do you have multiple stun breaks? That is totally unfair!\" Complaining, Mina ran over to Velin, pointing back at Thorn. \"Velin, he is cheating! I should be able to beat him. How can he ignore my spells like that?\"\"Congratulations on your victory,\" Velin nodded to Thorn as she ignored Mina. Turning to the silent crowd of players, who were looking at Thorn in various states of shock and fear, she raised her eyebrows. \"Does anyone else need a demonstration? If so, please step out.\" Waiting for a minute, and seeing that no one stepped forward, Velin looked at the archer who had first raised the issue. \"How about you? Are you satisfied?\"\"Ah, yes. Yes. No issues here.\" Nearly choking on his words, the archer avoided looking at Thorn.\"Good. Since everyone is satisfied, we will open up applications for the Titan squad. If you are interested in applying, please line up along the right side.\"Immediately, half of the crowd surged forward, jostling to get a good place in the line. Becoming a soldier carried some restrictions that many professional players were not fond of, but that was easily offset by Thorn's unbelievable combat ability. Watching him crush through some of the best crowd control in the game had convinced them that fighting beside Thorn would be profitable. After the players settled down, Velin dismissed those that did not apply and began to conduct the interviews. This time the players who shared a role competed against each other. After discussing it, Thorn and Velin had decided to assign the twenty slots in the Titan squad to a balanced group that focused on survivability. Thorn could deal absurd amounts of damage, so the squad would largely revolve around supporting him in that roll. Mina had reached out to Jorge to invite him back to the party after talking to Thorn about it, and the dwarf had agreed to give it a try. At the moment, Thorn's lawyers were helping him go through the process of dissolving his contract with Ragnarok so he could join Nova Luna. With Thorn, Mina, and Jorge, the initial crusade team was missing two players.Eventually, Velin decided on two support players who had played together as partners for over ten years. Seven Twisted Leaves was a Fae who looked like a human with tree bark for skin with the racial class Fae Druid, and Delmore was a Tigerkin Spirit Guide. Both classes were Support and Utility dual category classes that had high survivability but low damage output. Once the other fifteen members of the Titan squad had been picked, Velin arranged the Deimos and the Phobos squads, placing the remaining players into the reserve group. Over the next two weeks, the squads would work together to practice their coordination and develop the rapport necessary to run the high difficulty dungeons. Every morning, they would join the disciples from the Temple of the Moon in their morning training before practicing their raiding formation. During this time, Velin would pay close attention to their performance and pick out the leaders of each squad.For the first few days, the Titan squad also practiced with the other squads, but after the third day, they began to practice battle formations instead of the defensive focused raiding formations. Since all of the players in the Titan squad were elites, it did not take them long to grasp the battle formations, and they were soon able to swap between them smoothly. Seeing that the squad was working well together, Thorn decided it was time to join a crusade. But first, he had to meet Jorge.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Are you interested in reading the rest of Book #3?

Come explore the world of Nova Terra and help me determine where the story goes.You can find out more about me at www.sethring.com", "Knowing full well that meeting Jorge again was going to be awkward, Thorn arranged for the Titan squad to do a training session against the Deimos squad. Unlike his conversation with Mina and Velin, he assumed that Jorge would rather just move past what had happened rather than belaboring the point. Thorn had already asked Mina to pass his apology along, and he felt that it would be better to give Jorge time to get back into the routine of being in the party together before addressing it.When Mina and Jorge arrived, the dwarf looked around with barely contained shock. Mina had tried to describe Moon Wolf Citadel to him, but her words had not come close to doing it justice. Walking over to greet them, Thorn could tell that Jorge was still slightly uncomfortable, so he quickly introduced him to the rest of the members of the Titan squad.\"You got here just in time, Jorge. We are going to run one last scrimmage with the Deimos squad before we try our first crusade. Since we are limited to five people, we'll be taking you, me, Mina, Leaves, and Delmore. You will be responsible for scouting and will act as supporting dps. Mina will be crowd control and dps. I'm going to tank. Leaves has some crowd control and healing. Delmore is a buffer and, he has healing as well.\"Nodding that he understood, Jorge waved hello to the Fae and Tigerkin, who were looking him over.\"Got it. Have you picked which crusade we are going to do?\"\"No, not yet. I was waiting for you to arrive so we can talk about it. We can decide which we want to do after you see how the team works. Mina was saying that you have a lot of experience with the Battlefield of Flame and Shadow?\"\"Yeah. I ran as a scout for the Silver Guard. Sylith and the Silver Guard were responsible for grinding crusade rep, but they are about as subtle as a ton of flaming bricks, so the other groups pitched in players to act as scouts. I ran with them off and on for about six years.\"\"Awesome, then we'll be relying on you to point us in the right direction.\"\"I've got you. I know that battlefield like the back of my hand.\"Standing to the side, Mina listened to Thorn and Jorge talking, her expression getting stranger by the minute. As they lapsed into silence, she stared at each of them in turn. Finally, unable to hold it in, she exploded.\"Is that it?! You are just going to ignore the fact that you have not been talking for the last six months? Nothing? No sorry? No, I won't stab you again?\"Startled by her outburst, Thorn looked down at Jorge, who shrugged. \"Uh. Yeah.\" Thorn scratched his head.\"You...\" Her finger quivering, Mina pointed at Thorn. \"If you two idiots don't care, then what was I worrying about all this time?!\" \"I mean, it's not that we don't care.\"\"Yeah.\" Jorge agreed. \"It's just, what is the point talking about it?\" Seeing that Thorn was nodding, he continued. \"I know what we did was stupid, and I'm not going to do it again.\"\"Right, and I already said I forgive you all.\"\"I... you... Oh, forget it.\" Mina sighed in defeat, causing Jorge to chuckle.Patting Mina on the shoulder, Thorn called Leaves and Delmore over. The two support players had proven themselves quite capable in the duels with the Deimos squad, and Thorn was confident that, with the addition of Jorge, their team of five would be more than strong enough to clear the initial crusades.\"One last test match before we start our first crusade. Jorge, coordinate with Mina on targets. Delmore is our shot caller for now. Let's do this.\"The fight was short but brutal as Mina and Jorge used their stuns to incapacitate two of their opponents, and Thorn smashed the enemy tank with a single hit. Putting up a valiant fight, the players from the Deimos squad managed to nearly kill Leaves by focusing everything they had on the Fae, but a well timed [Spirit Swap] by Delmore pulled Leaves out of range. The Tigerkin's Spirit Guide class allowed him to summon supportive spirits whose auras and abilities affected the whole battlefield. By switching one of his spirits with Leaves, Delmore was able to keep him alive while the spirit who had been moved exploded into a poisonous mist. With their support stun-locked by Mina and Jorge and no way to get rid of the poison, the Deimos team was losing health fast, and they could only resign themselves to their fate. After the last player on their team was taken down, and everything was reset, their team leader walked over to Thorn.\"Well, that was embarrassing.\"\"Your name is Geliks, right?\" Thorn extended his hand for a handshake. Taking it, the warrior nodded, marveling at the massive difference in the size of their hands. \"Don't be too down. You five just started working together while these four have more experience playing together.\" \"That is true. Honestly, I don't know that fighting us will be any help. Your team is pretty solid as your individual skill levels are high. Mina and Jorge are an absurd combination, and while Delmore and Leaves are not the best in the game, they are solid support.\" Geliks rubbed his chin ruefully. \"And I have no words for you. I don't know what you hit me with, but if you can do it every time, then you will be fine. I think that time will help you improve your coordination, so from here it is just a matter of grinding out crusade missions.\"\"That makes sense.\" Thorn was a little disappointed that the fight had been so one-sided, but after hearing Geliks' words, he had to admit that the warrior was right. Velin had intentionally tried to make sure that the best players ended up in the Titan squad by offering excellent conditions. \"Thanks for helping out.\"\"Sure thing. Let me know if you need anything else. Velin has us running some practice dungeons to try and work out the kinks, but you are the boss, so just tell us if you want us doing something else.\"\"Haha, don't let Velin hear you say that.\" Thorn laughed as he waved his hands in protest.\"Hear what?\" At some point, the cold-faced elf had appeared behind Thorn.\"Hmm? Oh, hey, Velin.\" Thorn's face was a picture of pleasant surprise as he turned. \"You are here just in time. We're done with our practice fights, and we are ready to start our first crusade. Jorge was saying he has done a lot of them over the years, so I was hoping the two of you could fill me in on what our options are.\" Putting an arm around her shoulders, he gently led her away, paying no attention to her glare. \"Might as well start at the beginning because I don't know anything about the crusades.\"Gathering the Titan squad, Velin flipped open her notebook.\"In a moment, you will be starting the first mission. The first squad of five is going to be Thorn, Mina, Jorge, Seven Twisted Leaves, and Delmore. Currently, Thorn is a Commissioned Knight, limiting us to five players. Because our goal is to grind rep for the guild, we are not going to run multiple teams. However, while you are waiting for Thorn to upgrade his rank, you are welcome to form teams of five to run crusades yourselves. In fact, I recommend it. It will help you get back into the format of the missions, as I'm sure that most of you have not run missions for a couple years.\"Thorn, Jorge will explain more once you arrive, but remember that the goal is to gain 50 commendations so that you can rank up to an official Knight. That will increase the number of slots in your team to ten, which should allow you to make better progress. At 150 commendations, you will advance to Knight Captain, and we will be able to bring the whole team in. I'll be joining you at that point. For now, just focus on running missions. Any questions?\"\"No, I think I've got a handle on it.\"\"Good. Let me know if you need anything.\"\"Thanks, Velin.\" Flashing a smile at her, Thorn looked at the four members of the Titan squad that had joined him. Seeing that they were ready, Thorn opened up his menu and selected the crusade button, disappearing in a flash.Thorn felt his surroundings warp slightly, and suddenly they were standing in the middle of a military camp. Wooden and stone buildings surrounded them, squads of soldiers bustling here and there. A few players could be seen hanging around, but the majority of people were natives. Smoke rose from a few of the buildings, drifting gently into the darkening sky. The soldiers' armor was dented and scratched from intense use, and the aura they gave off was as sharp as a blade. Everywhere Thorn looked he saw tough veterans who walked and stood with precision. Surprised by how highly trained they appeared, Thorn looked to the south where the faint clashing of metal could be heard.\"Let's head to the board. I can explain how everything works on the way.\" Jorge's gruff voice brought Thorn back to the present. Continuing to look around, he followed the dwarf, who led the way to a large board where a collection of missions were posted.\"There are two categories of quests in the Battlefield of Flame and Shadow. The large, multi-step quests are called Crusades. They require a Knight Captain or higher officer to oversee them. However, we could join a crusade by fighting under another officer. Successfully completing a crusade should net you between five and twenty commendations, depending on how many steps you are part of. If you want to run our own quests, we can take a mission. They generally give between two and ten commendations depending on how hard they are.\"Missions could be anything from escorting supplies to guarding an important spot on the battlefield. Assaults, which happen just about every day, are also considered missions, though you get commendations based on the number of enemies you kill. There are also defensive missions where we guard the walls against assaults, which operate the same way.\"\"Hmm. Any suggestions for our first mission?\" \"Yeah, sure. I say that we look for an ambush mission. They are the most fun and have the highest potential reward. Not only do they give a fixed commendation reward, the enemies also tick up your kill count, which is worth commendations.\"\"Ambush?\" Mina scoffed. \"Have you looked at Thorn recently? We'd have to disguise him as an elephant. You might as well try and sneak up on someone while carrying a whale.\"\"Hey, I don't stand out that much.\" Rolling her eyes at Thorn's protests, Mina just jerked her thumb over her shoulder. Thorn turned his head and saw a whole crowd of soldiers staring at him. \"Alright, maybe I'm a bit more noticeable than most.\"\"Hah, Thorn's size is exactly why ambush is the best for us. He is a human freight train. If we ambush enemy squads, we can wipe them out before they can call reinforcements. We'll just have to find the right places to have our ambushes. Leave ambushing to me. I'm a master.\" Jorge patted his chest confidently.\"Um.\" Delmore cleared his throat, his whiskers twitching. Nervous, he looked at his wooden faced companion, who nudged him encouragingly. \"I can make us invisible.\"\"Yeah, like that will help... wait. Did you say invisible?\" Mina waved her hand dismissively until the Tigerkin's words sunk in. \"Ah, yeah. I have a spirit that can cast concealment as long as we don't move.\"\"Oh, yeah. That should work.\" Deflated, Mina looked at Jorge's triumphant expression and hmphed to herself. Slightly concerned by her response, Thorn looked between her and Jorge, who smirked.\"She is just mad because I'm better at ambushing than she is. Defensive missions are the quests she likes to run because that is the only way she can top my kill counts.\"\"Yeah right.\" Mina stuck her tongue out at Jorge, who just laughed. \"I can kill more devils than you any day of the week, no matter what sort of mission we are doing.\"\"That reminds me. Who are we fighting?\" Trying to distract Mina and Jorge, Thorn interrupted before the argument got worse. \"I've heard people say that we are fighting devils?\"\"Yup.\" This time Seven Twisted Leaves answered. \"They pretty much look like humans, but their skin is red and they have tails, horns, sharp teeth, sometimes multiple arms, or wings. I've seen some that walk on three legs. Now that I think about it, the only ones that look like humans are the really high level ones that have shape-shifted.\"The devils are invading the battlefield, and the Order of the Flame is resisting the invasion. Down south, the Demonkin fight against angels, but honestly, they are pretty much the same as the devils. They are not really angels. The high level ones look like angels, but only when they are transformed. Their real forms are the same as the devils. From what I understand, it is two races from the same place that are trying to wipe out all the other races on the battlefield.\"\"Everyone keeps calling this place the battlefield. Is it in Nova Terra?\"\"Eh, sort of.\" Jorge scratched his chin. \"The story is that this is a large portal that connects the world of the devils and angels to Nova Terra. The Order of the Flame and the Order of the Shadow both guard one of the entrances to Angoril. If either were to fall, then the devils or angels would flood over, and we would have to fight on the normal map.\"\"Interesting. Well, let's pick a mission. The sooner we get some commendations the sooner we can bring the whole team in.\" Thorn leafed through the available missions, finally settling on an ambush mission with Jorge's help. \"We need to stop by the commander's tent to accept the mission. Is there anything else we need to do before we start?\"\"Yeah, we should pick up supplies. We might be out in the wilds for a while, so food and camping gear are a must. The store also sells specialty items like ward stones, which will help hide us at night when we make camp and can also detect the presence of devils.\"\"Why don't you go and get what we need while I activate the mission? Leaves and Delmore can go with you to help.\" Pulling a small sack of gold from his inventory, Thorn tossed it to Jorge. Snatching it from the air, the dwarf tossed it in his hand as he estimated the contents. \"Is that going to be enough?\"\"Should be.\" \"Good. We'll meet by the main gate when we're done.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Are you interested in reading the rest of Book #3?

The camp itself was situated near the top of a mountain, overlooking a large plain. Behind the mountain was the portal leading to Angoril, while a hundred miles away, facing the camp, was the devil's camp. According to Mina, who had not stopped talking since they parted ways with the others, this battlefield was originally a piece of Angoril. A hundred years ago, the portals from the devils' world had been opened, and the devils and angels rushed through to attack Angoril. After a terrible fight, they were forced back to the land around their portals by a combined army of the native races. A powerful mage wove a world shaking spell, ripping part of the continent from the earth and binding it into its own space. In order to guard the battlefield, an order of humans and Demonkin was established.However, when the empire fell and the continent was split, the battlefield was split as well, resulting in the Battlefield of Fire and the Battlefield of Shadow. Fourteen years ago, the Order of Flame found itself facing an unprecedented push from the devil army, forcing them to open up recruitment to the travelers that covered Angoril. Though the main battles had been fought and won, there was still plenty to do on the battlefield.The guards at the door to the command center stopped Thorn warily as he approached. After finding out that he was there to activate a mission, one of the guards went inside to see if the commander was available, while the other gripped his sword and shield tightly, trying to appear as relaxed as possible. Noticing the guard's nervousness, Thorn tried to make some smalltalk, but that just served to unsettle the guard even more. Eventually, the guard who had stepped inside the building came back and invited Thorn and Mina inside. The majority of the command center was a large open room dominated by a massive table. Runic lines covered the sides of the table, showing a magical reproduction of the battlefield. Five heavily armored knights stood around the edge of the room, their eyes fixed on Thorn and Mina as soon as they walked through the door. Bending over the table, two older men talked in low voices. The older one straightened as Thorn approached, brushing his hand gently over his greying mustache.\"You are Commissioned Knight Thorn? Which mission did you bring?\" The commander's voice was exceptionally loud, causing the windows to rattle slightly in their frames.\"Hello, Commander. I was thinking about taking an ambush mission.\" Thorn handed over the paper he had taken from the board.\"Ambush, huh? Are you able to do that?\" Running an appraising eye over Thorn's huge form, the Commander turned his attention to the paper. \"This is a triple star mission. A bit much for your first mission, don't you think?\"\"I'm confident in my team.\" Thorn did not back down.\"You travelers have no regard for your lives anyway. Just don't try coming to me for compensation when you die. If you do manage to clear this ambush by some miracle, come back, and I'll reward you.\" The commander handed the paper to the other officer by the table, who placed it in a slot on the table.With a sudden jerk, the battlefield on the table shifted, zooming in to reveal a winding road. The west side of the road was forested while the east side stretched into a long, wide plain. Thorn could make out tiny devils marching forward on the road. From his quick glance, there seemed to be around a hundred of them escorting a strange, floating jar.\"The devils are trying to move the corruption forward. The Jar of Corrupted Spirits there, once planted, will suck the life out of a six mile radius, turning the land into the twisted nightmare that the devils love. Instead of waiting for the blasted thing to be planted, we want to destroy it before it can do any damage. Killing the devils should be counted as a bonus. The goal is to destroy the jar. I don't care how many of them survive as long as the jar doesn't make it. Am I clear?\"\"Yes, sir.\" Nodding, Thorn examined the group of devils. Of the hundred, there were three magic users, twenty bowmen, and two different groups that looked like melee fighters. One squad of ten walked upright like humans and carried massive, two handed war blades. The majority of the melee fighters skittered forward on four legs like animals, but the sharp blades on the ends of their feet looked dangerous.\"Normally, we suggest that a Knight Captain take this level of mission. Are you sure you'll be alright with this?\"\"We're confident, sir. As you said, our goal is destroying the jar, not wiping out all of the devils. I'm pretty good at destroying things.\" Thorn flashed a self-deprecating smile at the commander. Next to him, Mina snorted and looked away.\"If you are sure. Once you have destroyed the Jar of Corrupted Souls, you can come back, and we'll reward you.\" No longer bothering with them, the commander dismissed them with a wave, turning back to the projection of the battlefield that had zoomed back out.*ding* Leaving the command center, Thorn and Mina walked to the gate to wait for Jorge, Leaves, and Delmore. Wherever Thorn walked the soldiers stopped to stare, their eyes following his gargantuan form. Thorn was quite used to it, but the constant attention unsettled Mina a little bit. They had just arrived at the main gate when a voice called out from behind them.\"Hey, you're Thorn, right?\"Turning around, Thorn saw a group of six people walking over. In front stood a large blonde man dressed in purple and gold armor, his ice blue eyes glimmering brightly. Feeling Mina edge behind him with a shiver, Thorn looked down.\"That is Sylith,\" Mina said, her voice quiet, all of her enthusiasm gone.\"I thought I recognized you. After all, not many people are your size.\" Sylith grinned broadly, his perfect teeth flashing in the sun. \"Hello, Mina. It has been a little while.\"Ignoring him, Mina turned her head away, causing Sylith to chuckle. Turning his attention back to Thorn, he stepped forward.\"It is nice to meet you, Thorn. I heard you signed up for the crusades, so I thought I would come meet you. I guess I should thank you, shouldn't I? Angdrin has been disgraced, thanks to you, and has barely been able to hang on to his position.\"\"What about Ouroboros?\"\"Ha, I don't know exactly what you did to him, but he is no longer part of Ragnarok. After he lost to you, he got kicked out and is blocked from rejoining. Needless to say, he is pretty much ruined.\"\"You are welcome.\" \"Hmph.\" Sylith's smile slowly turned into a sneer. \"I didn't need your help clearing the chaff. And I've got a bone to pick with you. You made Ragnarok lose two competent generals, and you stole a region we wanted.\"\"Whoa,\" Thorn held a hand up to stop Sylith. \"They brought it on themselves. If they had not tried to take what was mine, they would not have suffered. Are you here to try your hand? If so, I can guarantee you the same ending they experienced.\"\"Oooh, I'm scared. I wouldn't be so confident, if I were you. I heard that in the real world you are not quite as impressive as you are in-game. A bird told me that you are currently undergoing medical treatment at an undisclosed hospital in North America while experiencing full immersion into Nova Terra. No doubt you have quite the background to be able to afford that sort of treatment, but I would recommend that you proceed carefully. There is much more to this game than you realize, and no amount of money in the real world will save you if you persist in fighting against Ragnarok.\"It was Thorn's turn to chuckle, though there was no mirth in his eyes.\"Jonathan Velks, 23 years old, 6' 3\", 196 lbs., parents are Moren and Samantha Velks, no siblings. Considered a genius, started his first business at twelve using money his dad gave him, made his first million by thirteen. Currently worth half a billion. Lives in an upscale apartment building he owns in Chicago. Father is a member of the city council, but has ties to organized crime. Joined Ragnarok three years ago and has risen to the leadership through a variety of tactics, including blackmail, threats of violence, monopolizing resources, and the establishment of an independent faction called the Silver Guard.\" Thorn's voice remained calm as if he was reading from a card.Sylith's face paled, his sneer fading. Grim faced, he listened as Thorn spoke, his eyes flickering. Behind him, his Silver Guard started to draw their weapons but froze when he held up his hand.\"Do I need to continue?\" Thorn stepped forward, towering above Sylith. He ignored the five Silver Guard players who had their weapons half drawn. \"Do not think that you are the only one who can pull strings in the real world, Jonathan. Believe me when I say that the very last thing you want to do is mix this and reality. I'll give you the same warning that I gave Ouroboros. If you mix the real world and Nova Terra, you will suffer for it.\"For a moment, the air was frozen, causing Mina to grasp the handle of her wand. Just as Thorn felt that the encounter was going to devolve into a fight, Sylith stiffened slightly, and then his whole demeanor relaxed as if the tension had never existed. Flashing a smile, he took a small step back.\"I'm glad we could have this talk, Thorn. I'm sure we'll encounter each other quite a bit in the future, so let's continue it then.\"Taken aback by Sylith's abrupt change in attitude, Thorn's brow furrowed. An enemy who could remain calm despite an implied threat was dangerous. As the Silver Guard turned away, Thorn noticed Leaves and Delmore standing behind them. Jorge was nowhere to be seen, but Thorn had no doubt he was lurking nearby. Sylith must have noticed them arrive and decided against a fight, since he was surrounded.A small figure materialized next to Thorn, a worried look in his eyes. Glancing at Thorn, Jorge was about to say something but seemed to think better of it. Pretending he had not noticed Jorge's conflicted hesitation, Thorn waved to Leaves and Delmore.\"What was that about?\" Delmore walked over, his eyes following the retreating players.\"Nothing important.\" Thorn waved his hand. \"Let's get going. We've got devils to ambush.\"According to the information contained in the quest, the devil force was moving toward a spot called the Silver Pine Hills. Due to the size of the force and the accompanying Jar of Corrupted Souls, they were traveling slowly, which gave Thorn and his team plenty of time to set up an ambush along the way. Looking at the map that Jorge had purchased, Thorn examined the potential ambush spots.The Dwarven rogue identified three places along the path the devils were taking that could be used to stage an ambush. The first two were places where the road curved around a mountain while the last was a narrow pass between two hills. After talking it over, the party decided that the best spot for their ambush would be the first location. Running at full speed, they rushed toward the ambush spot, talking over their plan as they traveled.Twisting around the edge of a mountain, the path had a cliff on one side and a forested slope on the other, making it ideal for catching a traveling force off guard. The narrow road ensured that the enemy would be spread out, which would allow the smaller team to prevent themselves from being swamped.\"Delmore, how does your invisibility field work?\" Thorn asked the Spirit Guide as he examined the location of their ambush.\"As long as we are standing together and we don't attack or use any abilities, we will be invisible. Once we break the concealment, it will renew itself if we don't do anything for two minutes.\"\"That sounds really convenient. Is there any way for the enemy to spot us?\"\"Umm. Yeah, but they would have to have an ability that would allow them to break the invisibility field somehow. Some ranger type classes have that ability. Or mages. The one thing we need to be careful of is advanced senses like smell and hearing. Invisibility does not guard against those things. It just makes you impossible to see.\"\"Alright. I know Mina has [Ice Wall] and [Blizzard] as area of effect crowd control. What else do we have?\"\"Umm.\" Seven Twisted Leaves scratched his head. \"I have [Grasping Vines]. It is an area of effect binding ability. If we are in the forest, I can use [Living Trees], but the trees are better at damage than crowd control.\"\"Okay, good. Jorge, how about you?\"\"All of my stuff is single target.\"\"I have [Wolf Lord's Howl]. I think the base stun is three seconds for any enemy who can hear. Between us, we should be able to lock down most of the enemy while we focus on breaking the jar. There are a lot of enemies, but if we hit them hard and fast, we should be able to break through and escape. Jorge, you are responsible for tying up any devils or greater devils. Mina and Delmore, you keep the main body of troops occupied. Leaves, can your teleport work on me?\"\"Yes. Any allied, willing target.\"\"Excellent. You are responsible for getting me out once I destroy the Jar of Corrupted souls. You are also responsible for sounding the retreat. If you see things going wrong, let us know, and we will pull out.\" Looking around at his team, Thorn chuckled at their serious expressions. \"Relax everyone. The worst thing that will happen is we'll fail. No need to stress over that. Jorge, we have about half an hour before they are supposed to pass this spot. Can you give us a heads up? We will need at least a four minute warning to get the invisibility field up.\"\"No problem. I'll head up the road to scout.\" With a sloppy salute, Jorge faded away, leaving the rest of the team to set up their ambush.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Are you interested in reading the rest of Book #3?

A warm breeze sent the leaves in the trees dancing, filling the forest with a whispering rustle. Lounging by the side of the road, it was hard to imagine that the team was on an Ambush quest. *ding*Flicking open the notification, Thorn stood and nodded to the others. \"Time to get started. Jorge spotted them along the road.\"\"Finally.\" Mina rolled her eyes. \"I don't know why we have to do all this planning. We could probably just crush them in a straight up fight.\"\"Possibly, but it never hurts to be cautious. If we win easily, we can adjust our strategy for the next one. Alright, let's set up here. Delmore, you're in charge of concealment. Leaves, drop your vines on the right side of the bend. You are responsible for tying up the right half. Mina, you'll be responsible for the left half. Remember, we are going to hit them fast and then back out.\" Delmore, pulling out a strange dagger with a long handle, muttered to himself for a moment and then began to shake. Seven Twisted Leaves, paying no attention to his convulsing friend, murmured a spell of his own and tossed out four seeds that burrowed their way into the dirt of the path. \"[Spirit of Concealment]!\" Shouting out the name of his spell, the Tigerkin stabbed his long handled dagger into the ground. Three feathers hanging from the end of the long handle began to glow with an eerie blue light and float, waving as if a breeze was blowing them. Little by little, everything in the surrounding area apart from the ground began to fade away. Retrieving his staff, Delmore pointed the end toward the waving feathers.\"Each feather gives us about ten minutes of concealment, making us invisible to anyone outside of a ten foot circle. Any ally that does not attack or use an offensive ability inside the circle will gain concealment after two minutes.\"\"That will be enough. Jorge said the advanced force will be here in about six minutes. Let's get ready. Summon Akira.\" An arcane pattern spread above Thorn's outstretched hand, pulsing slightly as Akira appeared, frozen in the midst of trying to jam a large sticky bun in her mouth. Locking eyes with Thorn for a brief moment, she forced the last bit of the pastry into her cheeks and scampered up Thorn's arm to sit on his shoulder.[Mmphf mph mmm!]\"\"What?\" Glancing at his pet's bulging cheeks, Thorn idly wondered why her words were muffled, considering that they communicated through their minds.[Mmhph. Ehem. I said, where are we?] \"Battlefield of Flame and Shadow.\" [Oooh, that sounds exciting. But where is the fire?]\"You know, I was wondering that myself. I imagine we'll see some soon, but I don't know. We'll be going into combat soon, can you heal me?\"[Of course I can, Master.] Akira jumped onto Thorn's head, her tails fluttering in the breeze. [I have the best heals.]\"Thanks. Delmore, you can focus on healing Mina, Jorge, and Leaves, okay? Akira here will be able to cover me.\" Once everyone was in their place, the team settled down to wait for the approaching devil force to appear. A few minutes later, Thorn spotted them winding their way up the road toward the point the team had picked for the ambush. The devils came in all sorts of grotesque shapes, though the majority were short, crouching, ghoul-like creatures that swarmed along the road. Surrounding the ghoulish devils were a handful of upright devils in armor, wielding shimmering metal whips. Thorn watched as a devil standing on two feet lashed his whip at a group of ghouls who wandered from the path. Squealing in anger and pain, the creatures scrambled back into the group, hissing their displeasure the whole time. Split into two groups, the Jar of Corrupted Souls floating serenely in the center, the army of devils was spread out into a long, thin line as they snaked along the road. Peering through the trees, Thorn kept his eyes fixed on the jar as it gently spun while bobbing along. The front half of the army consisted of the majority of the ghouls and a squad of muscular devils armed with large, jagged blades. After them came the Jar of Corrupted souls, accompanied by a few devils in shining armor or glimmering robes. Finally, another squad of Blade Devils and a group of three-legged devils holding short, spiky bows brought up the rear.As the army moved closer and closer to the ambush point, Thorn could feel his companions tensing up next to him in anticipation of the coming fight. Even Akira, normally unable to sit still for a moment, crouched on his shoulder, her little claws holding tight to his armor, her bright eyes fixed on the advancing horde. Step by step the devils came closer. Thorn did his best to calm himself down, but the burning excitement rising in his chest was becoming hard to control.A quick glance showed that Mina was standing completely motionless, her wand extended toward the devils, ready to unleash her first spell. The short Ice Witch continued to surprise Thorn with how serious she was when she entered combat, reminding him that he really couldn't judge people by the way they looked. Leaves and Delmore both looked relaxed but ready and Jorge was nowhere in sight, so Thorn swung his gaze back to the devils. Another minute ticked by as the devils advanced up the road, the ghoul vanguard passing over the ambush point. \"Lets go.\" Thorn's whisper rumbled out through the visor of his helmet as he dropped into a half-crouch. \"[Grasping Vines]!\"\"[Ice Wall]!\"The words falling from Mina and Leaves' lips signaled the beginning of the chaos as the devil army found themselves split. Green shoots burst from the ground around the ghouls, growing at a tremendous rate, the tough rattan winding its way around the crouched figures as it grew. Each vine began to sprout with thorns, sending the sharp points into the ghouls that they trapped.Behind the Jar of Corrupted Souls, the humanoid devils found themselves facing a large wall of ice that blocked off the whole road. Startled, the Blade devils dashed forward, slamming their jagged cleavers into the freezing wall. Chips of ice flew through the air, peppering the devils with shards of ice, yet the wall held.The four Greater Devils around the floating Jar of Corrupted Souls jerked in surprise as the two spells landed. Two of the devils lifted their twisted staves into the air, the embroidered sleeves of their robes falling back to reveal arms covered in arcane tattoos At the same time, the other two Greater Devils drew large claymores from their backs. Yet, before any of the Greater Devils could begin to act, a massive silver blur came flying through the air, smashing down onto one of the Greater Blade Devils. Stunned, the two Greater Spell Devils who had raised their arms to cast froze, their eyes fixed on the spot where the Greater Blade Devil stood a moment before. In its place, a menacing figure in gleaming silver armor rose, a massive metal mace held casually in a gauntleted hand. Reduced to a bloody mess by Thorn's assault, the Greater Blade Devil had barely raised its sword when it was pulverized under the force of Thorn's tetsubo. Corrosive blood slid off of Thorn's armor without leaving so much as a mark and he raised his weapon, ready to engage the others.The other Greater Blade Devil shrieked and lifted its jagged blade, spittle flying as it rushed toward Thorn. At the same time, both Greater Spell Devils changed their targets, pointing their staves at the silver threat in front of them. Arcane energy began to gather on the ends of their staves, coalescing into rolling balls of flame. Ignoring the three attacking Greater Devils, Thorn activated [Shadow Dash], shifting in and out of sight as he darted forward to smash his tetsubo down on the Jar of Corrupted Souls.The Greater Blade Devil's strike slipped through Thorn's form as he charged past, causing the devil's rage to erupt. Turning, the Greater Devil was about to chase after Thorn when its feet abruptly sank into the ground. Standing near the edge of the woods, Leaves finished casting [Earth Prison] and immediately began the chant for [Greater Earth Spear]. Large clumps of dirt and stone rose into the air, spinning tightly into iron hard spikes that stabbed into the trapped Greater Blade Devil, dyeing its armor in black ichor. Almost simultaneously, both Greater Spell Devils who were about to launch their spells at Thorn froze, their spells fizzling into nothing.\"[Sub Zero]!\" A flash of cold air appeared above one of the Greater Spell Devils, freezing it in place. Without wasting a single moment, Mina turned her attention to the [Ice Wall] that was about to fall and chanted a short, arcane phrase. \"[Blizzard]!\" The shattering ice from the wall began to swirl together, forming a whirling ball of deadly ice that minced the first Blade Devils it touched.Behind the other Greater Spell Devil, a short, shadowy figure slipped into view, his long daggers blurring as black blood splashed, sending corrosive smoke into the air as it landed. Neatly dodging through the acidic spray, Jorge slid past his first target to sink both daggers into the neck of the frozen Greater Spell Devil.*WHHUUUUM!*Thorn's full-power strike landed on the Jar of Corrupted Souls, sending a loud resonant sound throughout the battlefield. Protected by a magical shield that absorbed over eighty percent of the damage, Thorn's attack still sent hairline cracks running over the jar. Drawing back his tetsubo again, he unleashed another attack.*WHHUUUUM!*Again, the sound echoed between the mountain and the forest. The jar's magical shield rippled and dimmed as the cracks widened. Spinning to help deal with the rebounding force, Thorn took a quick glance around. Mina was busy raining a nearly endless amount of ice spikes on the massive group of ghouls that were struggling their way free of Leaves' [Grasping Vines] while Delmore did his best to keep the others topped up on mana. Jorge had shifted his focus and was engaged in a deadly dance with the Greater Blade Devil. Seven Twisted Leaves had called up three Treants from the side of the road and was doing his best to hold the Blade Devils and Arrow Devils back.Taking in the situation, Thorn threw back his head and howled, activating [Wolf Lord's Howl]. As the waves of sound rang over the devils, they faltered. Jorge, seizing on the Greater Blade Devil's hesitation, blinked behind its back, his daggers flashing through the joints in its neck armor. At the same moment, Mina took advantage of the ghouls falling into a stupor to chant an arcane phrase, burying the ghouls in a thick blanket of snow. \"[Avalanche]!\"On the other side, seeing the Blade Devils and Arrow Devils fall into a stunned state, Leaves murmured a quick spell under his breath and threw out two seeds that immediately burst into thick vines, wrapping the devils in jagged vines.*WHHUUUUM!**crack*With a tiny shattering sound, the Jar of Corrupted Souls crumbled into shards as the magical shield collapsed.*ding* \"Retreat!\" Without bothering to read the quest completion notification, Thorn called for the team to pull back. With a twist of shadow, Jorge appeared next to Mina at the edge of the forest. Thorn rushed toward the team, completely ignoring the devils milling about in confusion behind him. A few arrows from the Arrow Devils glanced off of his armor, chipping away at his health, but Akira cast [Royal Grace] on him, filling his health back up.As the party ran, Delmore pulled a few twigs from his pouch and swiftly wove a circular symbol. Tossing it to the ground, he pointed his long handled dagger at it and called out, \"[Spirit's Maze]!\" A deep mist began to billow forth from the symbol, quickly filling the forest and making it almost impossible to see. Leading the way, he brought the team out of the fog. \"That should keep them off our trail.\"\"Excellent. Let's head back to the fort.\"\"That was awesome!\" Now that the fight was over, Mina had reverted to her normally bubbly self. \"I can't believe you smashed that thing in three attacks. Did you see how many ghouls I killed? I probably killed forty or fifty of them! Hey Jorge, did you see that? How many devils did you kill? Like three?\"\"Three Greater Devils? Yeah. Three. Ghouls are nothing but chaff.\" Jorge sneered, his daggers flashing as he spun them in his hands.\"They might be chaff, but you couldn't kill that many in a minute.\" Mina rolled her eyes. \"Plus, you had how much help?\"At the back of the group, Leaves and Delmore jogged next to each other, their eyes fixed on Thorn's broad back. As if they were of one mind, the two friends glanced at each other before they looked at Thorn, who was feeding Akira as they ran.\"Three attacks. That was a full magic shield.\" Leaves shook his head, his eyes betraying his unbelief at how smoothly the ambush had gone.\"That's not all of it. You didn't see him look around before he cast his area stun. He picked the optimal time. Not so early that it overlapped, early enough to cement the fight. He hits like a freight train and has great judgment.\"\"What about the rest of the team?\"\"Nothing needs to be said about Mina. She's probably in the top 10 in the game, and she obviously respects the boss, so she won't mess around. Jorge, I'm not sure about. He is hard to read. But he is good.\"\"That is true. I agree. Add Velin in and we've got a ridiculously solid core team.\"The two friends fell quiet as they jogged along. Seeing Thorn look back to make sure that everyone was keeping up, Leaves glanced at Delmore.\"So you think we picked a good team to join?\"\"Yeah.\" The Tigerkin nodded, his lips lifting into a grin as he picked up the pace. \"This is going to be fun.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi Everyone!

The first mission had netted the team sixteen commendations, and though the next few missions had given less, the team had quickly gathered more than half of the commendations they needed to bring more people into the Battlefield of Flame and Shadow. Looking up from where he was looting the battlefield, Thorn flashed a smile at the dwarf.\"Good. Let's call it a day. Once we turn in these quests, we'll head back to the citadel.\" Standing up, Thorn stretched to his full height. The team had run two quests and fought three roaming bands of devils, and everyone apart from Thorn was starting to show their fatigue. Two of the roaming bands had been small squads of Blade Devils that were quickly cleared, but the last band had been made up of a large mob of ghouls and a full squad of Arrow Devils accompanying a high level Devil Commander. \"Ow ow ow. Hey, watch it.\" Off to the side, Mina complained as Delmore held a fur-covered hand over a cut on her side.\"Maybe next time, don't try to fight a Devil Commander by yourself.\" The Tigerkin poked Mina in the side as he chanted in a low voice, sending waves of spectral energy into Mina's side. Wiping his hands off once the cut had closed, he grinned, his whiskers twitching. \"You're all better. Just try to avoid doing it again today. I'm all out of juice.\"\"Yeah, I got it. Thanks.\" Mina stood up and twisted her waist, testing for pain. \"Hey, Thorn. Are we still going? I'm probably only good for half a fight before I'm toast.\"\"No, we'll head back now. We've had enough close calls for today.\" Sliding his helmet back on, Thorn called Akira over from where she sat on a pile of broken stones. \"Let's get going. Sooner we make it back to the fort, the sooner you can all go rest.\"\"About time,\" Leaves complained as he dragged himself up from where he had been lying on his back. Laughing, Thorn led the dragging group toward the entrance to the Battlefield of Flame and Shadow.After turning in their quest and redeeming the extra commendations they received, the party split up. Leaves, Delmore, Jorge, and Mina all logged out to get some sleep while Thorn unsummoned his battle pet and teleported back to Moon Wolf Citadel. Striding through the halls of the fortress, Thorn checked over his [CMS]. The initial rush of new players spawning as Wolfkin had slowed down and was holding steady at around a hundred a day, which suited Thorn just fine. The valley was filled with players exploring the new race. At first, Thorn had been worried that they would run out of room, but, despite how many had arrived in the first month, the valley had grown to accommodate them all. It was a strange feeling. Even though Thorn knew objectively that the valley had been smaller when he first arrived, it felt completely normal to him that it was now much larger. In addition to the size of the valley growing, Greymane Village had grown in area as well, becoming a large town whose edges reached the back gate of the citadel. Thorn would still have to manage both the valley and the town, but due to the number of people who had moved in, he had a lot more space to work with.Flicking through the tabs, Thorn noticed that the Temple of the Moon was getting a steady supply of new disciples as players discovered the class path. Opening up his messenger, Thorn called Velin.\"Hello, Thorn.\"\"Hey, where are you right now?\"\"I'm in the office. Do you need me?\" Velin stopped what she was doing and looked up.\"Yeah, but I'll come to you.\"The fortress had gotten busier and busier ever since Nova Luna had opened up enrollment to the public. Even with the rigorous background checks Velin instituted, the guild quickly grew to thousands. To keep everything running smoothly, Velin organized a group that handled the administration of the guild. These players could be seen everywhere in the citadel, making sure that the guild operated like a well-oiled machine. Entering the large throne room, Thorn walked to a door in the back, stepping into a study which had walls lined with shelves. A large stool sat in the corner for when Thorn was present, but the piece of furniture that truly dominated the room was a massive desk in front of the floor-to-ceiling window. It was from this desk that Velin kept the citadel, the guild, and the valley running. \"What do you need?\" Velin put down the report she had been reading when Thorn entered the room and fixed her attention on him.\"I just had a couple questions.\" Opening his [CMS], Thorn shared it with Velin. \"Overall, profits are up, but our expenditures for the Deimos and Phobos squads are also way up. It looks like they are putting in for three times the amount of repairs than we anticipated.\"\"Hmmm. I missed that. Sorry.\" \"Nah, don't worry about it. We might have misjudged the projected cost.\"\"True. I'll make a note to look into it. How were your crusades today?\"\"They went well. The team is really coming together. We had a really tough fight at the end, though. We were attacked by a whole squad of ghouls, which wouldn't have been bad, except they had support from a bunch of Arrow Devils. Even that would have been doable, but when Mina went to tie them up, she got ambushed by a Devil Commander who was hiding in the back. If Jorge had not blinked over to pick up aggro, she would have died. Thankfully, he was able to tank it until I got there.\"\"She mentioned that she was exhausted.\"\"Yeah, it was a good day, but it was pretty long.\"\"You look pretty spry.\" Velin's lips curled in a slight smile as she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. \"Eh, I don't get tired.\" Grinning, Thorn pulled the large stool over and sat down, looking out the window at the merchant quarter. Despite it being evening, the market was bustling. \"Looks like the merchants have settled in nicely. Have we been having any trouble?\"\"There was a little bit, but the disciples quashed it quickly. We do have an issue on the production side though.\" Seeing Thorn's frown, Velin leafed through the papers on her desk and handed Thorn a list. \"These are players who have joined our production department. However, the six players at the top are all demanding better contract conditions. The leader is GoldHammer, a Master Blacksmith. He seems to have organized the other master crafters into a union of sorts and is encouraging a lot of the other crafters to hold out for better terms as well.\"\"Is this normal?\"\"Honestly? Yes.\" Velin sighed, rubbing her forehead. \"A steady supply of high level consumables and gear is vital to any guild that wants to be serious about running dungeons, so crafters tend to be able to pick their working conditions. We tried to only bring in unaffiliated crafters who would not be as picky, but he slipped through.\"\"Hmmm.\" Thorn looked back outside, watching as the lights in the market began to come on. \"Set up a meeting for Corvo. I'd like to let him chat with Mr. Goldhammer first to see if he can get it worked out. If he can't we'll resort to more drastic measures. Don't forget to tell Corvo that he can lean on my lawyers.\"\"Sure.\"\"Thanks. I've missed a couple days of training, so I'll be down at the temple.\" Waving, Thorn left the study and headed toward the training yard. Ever since he had beaten Ouroboros, Thorn had been traveling almost non-stop, leaving him no time to practice his class. Unlike many games, Nova Terra did not have a leveling system. Instead, once a player showed the appropriate level of mastery, they would be eligible to move forward along their class path. Opening his status window, Thorn looked at his class. Since Nova Terra lacked a traditional leveling system, Thorn needed to improve his proficiency in order to master his class. The two areas he knew that he could polish were his [Martial Form] and [Basic Weapons Mastery]. The [Dawn Form] he had chosen had a leadership category focus and lacked a clear way for him to increase his proficiency, but the daily training offered by the temple gave him a clear path to follow for building his proficiency with the basic monk weapons.Opening his [Martial Form], Thorn looked for clues about how he could build his proficiency. As he had grown more comfortable with Nova Terra, he quickly realized that the game hid countless secrets in plain sight, rewarding those who explored every option. Despite being described as a Martial Form, the [Dawn Form] had little to do with direct combat, instead focusing on leading others to triumph in martial conflict. Both of the abilities he had gained through the [Dawn Form] had been helpful, not only in his fight with Ouroboros, but even in his conflicts in the capital. From the looks of it, his current path leading a crusade team and overseeing the valley were the best ways for him to passively build toward mastering his class. Thorn had felt the power of his [Oration Proficiency] over the last few weeks. Even when he had faced off against Ouroboros, the increased resistance to verbal persuasion had ensured an even playing field. After the fight, Thorn had asked Elder Havva about the amplifying effect that had appeared when the Wolfkin in the fortress had joined his [Rallying Cry]. The elder had mentioned that [Rallying Cry], like most of the other abilities that Wolfkin gained through the Disciple class, had an amplifying effect when used in concert with other members of the Temple of the Moon.Deciding to use both abilities as often as he could, Thorn arrived at the yard where the temple disciples were practicing their forms. Scattered groups of Wolfkin practiced with various weapons, honing their skills against one another. Thanks to the advanced healing provided by the game, they could fight each other without pulling their punches, giving full focus to improving their practical combat ability.\"My Lord!\" Running over, one of the Wolfkin instructors knelt before Thorn could stop him, causing the groups of Wolfkin to look over. The native disciples quickly greeted Thorn respectfully while the players looked on, curious. A few repeated the salute, fully immersed in their characters.\"Please, get up. When I am here you don't need to treat me as Lord Greymane.\"\"I'm sorry, sir, I cannot do that.\" Rising, the instructor waved for the other disciples to continue with their practice. \"And even if you are not treated as Lord Greymane, you are still the Inheriting Disciple of the Temple.\"\"Okay, okay.\" Waving his hands, Thorn gave in.\"Thank you, my Lord. Now, what can I do for you?\" The instructor smiled, pleased with his small victory.\"I need some training. I'm looking for the Dawn Court trainer. Or anyone who can help me learn how to use the basic weapon set.\"\"Of course. Please come this way.\" Gesturing for Thorn to walk ahead, the instructor looked over his shoulder and shouted toward one of the groups of disciples practicing with rods. \"Jemy! Run and get Deacon Errul from the Dawn Court. My Lord, Deacon Errul is the Dawn Court trainer. All of the disciples practice weapons training together, so you are welcome to join us at any time. The Dawn Court abilities are a little different though, so I thought it would be better if we called Deacon Errul over.\"\"That makes sense.\" As the instructor spoke, Thorn looked around, counting six different practicing groups. \"We train with six different basic weapons in the Temple of the Moon, my Lord. Fists, axes, maces, swords, polearms, and staves. We also have specialized weapons like the chain-whip, three-sectioned staff, butterfly swords, and kama, but those are part of the advanced weapon training. In order to be considered proficient in these weapons, you must complete the introductory form for each weapon and the journeyman form for at least two categories. Any weapons you are trained in already can count.\"\"What about this?\" Summoning his tetsubo from his inventory, Thorn balanced it in his hand.\"Ah, that could stand in for the mace, my Lord. You will need to be assessed by one of the Deacons, but having seen you use it before, I'm confident it would qualify. I imagine that your unarmed combat would qualify for at least the journeyman level as well, leaving axes, swords, polearms and staves. Learning the forms and gaining enough practice to use them in a fight is all that is needed for the introductory level, so I am sure you will get there quickly.\"\"Sounds good. Why don't we start with the sword forms?\"\"Of course. Come this way. Do you have any experience with swords?\"\"Yes. Mainly the straightsword. I've had some experience with sabers, as well.\"\"Then you should pick this up fast. To begin, we use wooden swords. You can get one from the rack. Follow along as I demonstrate.\"Striding over to a rack of swords at the edge of the yard, Thorn selected the largest sword he could find. The six foot blade looked more like a short sword in his massive hand, but since there was nothing bigger, Thorn swung it a few times and took his place behind the instructor.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi Everyone!

When he first started playing, he had been surprised to discover that many of the normal inconveniences of everyday life had been eliminated. However, contrary to what he initially thought, the game still included things like sweat, but only when it added to the player's experience. As he stared at the notification, a beep let him know that he was getting a call.\"Thorn, you might want to come see this.\" As soon as the call connected, Oberlin's nervous face appeared. The thief's eyes were bright with excitement, but his lips were twitching, betraying his conflicting feelings.\"Where are you?\" \"I'm in my room, but I'll meet you in the throne room.\"\"Sure, I'll be right there.\"Informing the deacon that he was leaving, Thorn put the wooden practice sword he had been using back on the rack and left the temple grounds, heading for the fortress. As soon as he stepped out of the training yard, his sweat disappeared and his clothing went back to normal, as if he had not spent the last three hours doing any strenuous activity. Climbing the stairs to the throne room for the second time, Thorn wondered idly about installing an elevator. It wasn't that climbing the stairs tired him out, instead, it was the amount of time it took that bothered him. Velin, Corvo, and Oberlin were all crowded around something in the center of the hall when Thorn opened the door. Staring at it so intently that they did not hear him come in, it wasn't until Thorn loomed over them that they realized he was there. Jumping slightly, Oberlin slid to the side, revealing two metal spheres. Each was the size of a softball and rested on three spindly legs. The spheres were smooth on the top with a thick metal band around the middle that was covered in runes.\"What are these?\" Unable to see anything special from his first, cursory look, Thorn raised his eyebrows and looked at the slim thief.\"Uh, I think they are keys,\" Oberlin replied, scratching the back of his head. \"I got them from those six boxes that we stole from Angdrin. Remember those? It took me quite a while to crack them, but when I did, these came out, along with some ancient Dwarven armor.\"\"Keys? Why do you think they are keys? They look nothing like keys.\"\"Maybe less keys, and more maps. Right after I got the second one out, that World Quest was announced. So these probably have something to do with that.\"\"They are Dwarven earth maps,\" Corvo said, running his fingers over the runes that ringed the spheres. Seeing the others look at him, he shrugged. \"I don't know any more than that. My ability lets me see information, but I can't actually read the ancient Dwarven runes.\"Both Oberlin and Thorn immediately turned and looked at Velin.\"I don't know ancient Dwarven, either. But we should get Jorge in here. He might have some idea.\" Velin frowned as she flipped through her notebook. Not finding what she was looking for, she shrugged. \"These runes are a bit different from modern Dwarven script, so I don't know if Jorge will be any help, but it is worth a shot.\"\"He logged out to sleep, so we'll probably have to wait a bit. In the meantime, let's see what we can figure out. If they are a map, we'll probably need to activate them in some way.\"\"We've been trying, but no luck so far.\" It was Oberlin's turn to shrug. \"They don't respond to anything we do.\"\"What have you tried?\"\"Everything. We've tried using magic, solving it like a puzzle, I even tried putting it in different conditions like water and fire to see if it would react. Nothing so far.\"\"Well, let's leave them for now. If they are related to the World Quest, something will turn up eventually. We should focus on figuring out how to find the fortress hidden in the earth that the quest mentioned. We know they are underground, so it is likely that a miner or someone diving in a subterranean dungeon will be the one who uncovers something.\"\"I will send out a notification to the guild for everyone to be on the lookout.\" Velin looked up from her book, her eyes resting on Thorn, who had stopped and was staring absently at the ceiling. \"What is it?\"\"We need to send someone to Embersplit mine. There is an ancient Dwarven ruin there. That is where Angdrin pulled out the chests. I wouldn't be surprised if that ruin is one of the fortresses we are looking for. From the quest description, we know that there are multiple fortresses, so we should be on the lookout for some sort of incursion from underground. An attacking force. If we find something, we'll probably find a fortress nearby.\" Rubbing his chin, Thorn glanced over at Corvo, who was still examining the metal orbs. \"Corvo, can you connect with Josephine and try to find out if she has any idea what is going on? Feel free to spend some money if you need to use Avalon.\"\"I'm on it.\" Flashing a grin, Corvo put down the earth map. With a nod to Velin and Oberlin, he ran to the edge of the throne room's balcony and launched himself off, transforming into a raven in a burst of black smoke.\"Showoff,\" Oberlin muttered, looking at the bird flying away.\"Should we contact the Society of Roses?\" Velin's attention was still fixed on Thorn, completely ignoring Corvo's antics. \"They have one of the best dungeon diving teams in Nova Terra.\"\"It doesn't hurt to send them a message.\" Thorn scratched his chin. \"I'll get in touch with my aunt and ask what their plans are. Depending on the party sizes, we could possibly collaborate.\"\"I think that is a good idea. We have a solid core of professional players, but we have not been working together long enough to make it into the top ranks. If we want to compete with the top guilds, we have a long way to go.\"\"Hey, that reminds me.\" Thorn walked over to the Wolf Throne and sat down. \"I ran into Sylith in the Battlefield of Flame and Shadow. He was pretty aggressive. We haven't heard a whole lot from Ragnarok, but from his attitude, it doesn't seem like they'll be letting things go.\"\"You did deal quite a blow to their plans. Ragnarok has been fighting for years to increase their rank, and opening a new starter location would have gone a long way toward realizing that goal. Yet you snatched it from under their noses. Ragnarok and the Eastern Alliance have been locked in a fierce struggle for second place for years, and you entering the fight set Ragnarok back quite a bit.\"\"What is so good about second place? What about Avalon? Why don't Ragnarok and the Eastern Alliance challenge Avalon for number one?\"\"Avalon is too difficult to fight. They are not a guild in the way we are a guild or Ragnarok is a guild.\" Velin's brow furrowed and she opened up her notebook, running her finger down the page. \"They appeared a few years after the game opened, but they are not organized into a formal guild. Instead, they are a collection of players who are fiercely loyal to their boss, Avalon. Real name, David Conners, real world location unknown. It is suspected he lives in Fantasia or Nova Terra at all times.\"\"You mean full immersion?\" Thorn shifted into a more comfortable position, resting his chin on his palm. He knew that once Velin got started it might be a while.\"Yes. It is rare, but getting more common. What is unique about his situation is that he has shown the signs of a full immersion player from the first days that he appeared in the game, just days after Nova Terra opened. David started the group that holds his name as a loose collective of merchants. They now have fingers in almost every pie in both northern and southern Angoril.\" Pointing in the direction of the market, Velin smiled without humor. \"Case in point, they were one of the first to request an office space in the market quarter. However, they only use their network to buy and sell goods and information. Avalon has a strictly neutral stance. They sell to anyone who can afford their goods and never take sides.\"\"That means we don't have to worry about them ganging up on us? That is convenient. What about Eastern Alliance? Can we use them to help deter Ragnarok?\"\"EA is a super guild made up of three smaller guilds that used to rank third, fourth, and fifth. They banded together to deal with aggression from the then number two guild, North Star. After the conflict, North Star fell to their current position at number seven. EA is tricky. They are very good at absorbing smaller guilds. While they are an excellent choice for suppressing Ragnarok, I would be cautious about letting them get involved.\"\"Fair. How do we rank? I know we just started Nova Luna, but what are people saying about us?\"\"Ambitious, aggressive, dangerous. Most people think we are an offshoot of the Society of Roses and are treating us as a branch guild.\"\"Haha, that makes sense, I guess.\" Thorn rose and stretched. \"Alright, keep up the good work, Velin. Let me know if anyone finds anything. I'm going to get some sleep.\"\"Thank you, Thorn. I will.\" Hearing the undisguised appreciation in Thorn's voice, Velin's lips curled into a small, self-satisfied smile as she watched him leave. After the door shut, her gaze turned to the valley stretching into the darkness, her mind turning over all that had happened since she first met Thorn. The giant had brought a tumultuous storm with him, turning her ordered life into chaos that she was only now recovering from. Yet, for all that had happened, Velin found herself happier now than she had been. After a good night's sleep, Thorn rose early to continue his weapons practice. The team had planned to continue grinding commendations in the Battlefield of Flame and Shadow, but because of the time dilation, he did not expect the others to log back in until the next day. At the rate they had been amassing commendations, Thorn estimated that it would only take another two days of quests before they had enough commendations for rank of Knight. Since he had a firm grasp of the basic sword form that the temple taught, Thorn began to practice the basic unarmed form. Consisting of eight total movements, the form was designed to take advantage of the Wolfkin's speed and agility and incorporated their natural claws. After a few hours of practice, once Thorn was comfortable with the movements, he switched to the next weapon. Half way through the day, the Deacon in charge of basic weapon training for the Dawn Court arrived, and Thorn began his combat tests, starting with the sword form.\"Afternoon, Lord Greymane. My name is Errul. I am a Deacon of the Dawn Court. I will be assisting with your basic weapon tests. From what I've been told, you have a strong grasp of the forms. Have you had much martial practice before?\"\"Hello, Deacon.\" Facing the silver furred Wolfkin, Thorn felt uncomfortable. \"I've had quite a few years of training in martial arts, though the form I learned is not directly designed for combat.\"\"You seem to have adapted it well, my Lord.\" Deacon Errul pointed toward the rack of swords. \"Please select your blade. The sword test requires that you perform the basic sword form three times. You will be judged based on a combination of the three attempts, so don't worry if one of them is rough. There will also be a combat test where you will face off against another disciple. While you will get points for winning, the goal is to see you use the form during the fight.\"Picking up his sword, Thorn stood in the middle of the yard, taking a moment to center himself before looking at Deacon Errul. At the deacon's nod, Thorn lowered his body into the basic stance, his mind rapidly running through the form. Feet shoulder width apart, one in front of the other. Lower center of gravity, relaxed shoulders, sword held at a thirty degree angle in the right hand, left hand up. Pausing for a moment in the basic stance, Thorn counted to three in his head before beginning his movements.The form consisted of three blocks and five attacks, all designed around mobility. The blocks were all angled defenses, designed to redirect the enemy's attacks, nullifying their energy. The attacks were the standard set of high slash, low slash, overhead chop, rising cut, and stab. Running through the eight motions three times with a few seconds pause between each set, Thorn stopped and looked over at Deacon Errul, who gave him a thumbs up.\"Perfect. For the next part of the test, you'll be fighting one of the other disciples.\" Looking around, his eyes fixed on a group of disciples that were standing at the edge of the yard, watching Thorn's test. \"Hey, you. Yeah, you. What's your name? Eat More Pork? What kind of name is that? Anyway, come here. You'll be fighting against Lord Greymane for your test.\"Dumbfounded, the player that Deacon Errul pointed to looked at his friends, who shrugged in sympathy but still pushed him forward. Stumbling into the middle of the yard, Eat More Pork drew his sword, standing nervously in front of Thorn. Most Wolfkin were tall, standing at six feet or taller, and Eat More Pork was no exception. Despite his height, looking up at Thorn's towering figure, the unlucky disciple could not help but shrink. Deacon Errul, looking at the quivering 'volunteer' unhappily, patted him on the back.\"Don't worry, young one. You'll do fine if you stick to the basics. Just remember what you've been taught and do your best. Remember, your goal is to give him a good fight, not win. The fight will be five minutes or until someone wins.\"As the Deacon spoke, Eat More Pork, who had been cowering in front of Thorn, started to straighten, a spark igniting in his eyes. By the time Deacon Errul's words faded, Thorn felt as if he was facing an entirely different person. The deacon walked back to the edge of the training yard, tossing a wink at Thorn as he went. \"Start!\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi Everyone!

Collapsed on the ground around him were countless disciples, all pretending to be knocked out in case he decided to continue practicing with them. The first few trial fights against Eat More Pork had been fine since Thorn was familiar with swords, maces, and unarmed combat, but in the next three fights, Thorn relied on his brute strength to overpower his opponents.A few stood up to the first blow, but collapsed like everyone else at the second. Realizing that the tests proved little challenge for Thorn but were very difficult for the other disciples, Deacon Errul began to send them to fight the giant as fast as they fell. He even commanded those who rose to their feet after being beaten to go fight again, resulting in the large pile of players pretending to be knocked out.\"You're well on your way to having a good grasp of all the basic weapons, my Lord. If you keep practicing, you'll master them in no time. You can also find masters who provide training, which will allow you to master the weapons faster.\"\"Thank you, Deacon.\" Thorn clasped his hand to his chest in a traditional warrior's salute. \"I was also hoping that you would help me with training my speaking abilities. I was very impressed with how easily you encouraged the first fighter to face off against me. I would love to learn how to do that sort of thing.\"\"Encouraging and inspiring others to acts of courage is part of the Dawn Court's mission, and I would be happy to teach you. Why don't you put the weapons away and then follow me to the Dawn Court to begin your training.\"His eyes lighting up, Thorn quickly organized the practice weapons that lay all over the ground and followed the deacon to the headquarters of the Dawn Court. Each of the four temple Courts had their own section where the dual category classes were taught. The Dawn Court's area consisted of a large library, a few large buildings used for discussion and classes, a medical room, and an outdoor amphitheatre.As they walked through the Dawn Court, Deacon Errul pointed out the various buildings and described their uses. Eventually they arrived at one of the classrooms, and Thorn ducked through the doorway as he followed Deacon Errul in. Looking around for a place to sit, he eventually sighed and got his rock chair out, taking a seat in the middle of the classroom.\"I will be going over a basic introduction today, my Lord, but you'll have to join one of the classes to get advanced techniques. Classes normally run twice a week for an hour. The schedule is posted on the door.\" Pausing when he saw Thorn raise a massive hand, Deacon Errul pointed to him. \"Go ahead.\"\"Are classes the only way for me to increase my [Oration Proficiency]?\"\"No, no. Classes provide a bonus to increasing your proficiency, but at the end of the day, only practice will make you better at talking. The classes only provide a place for you to practice the various skills.\"\"Got it. So I can increase my [Oration Proficiency] and [Rallying Cry] out in the field by using them regularly.\"\"Correct. However, that is the slowest way to improve. Learning and practicing specific techniques and then using them is much better. Let me demonstrate.\" Walking up to the board at the front of the class, Deacon Errul picked up a stick of chalk and wrote quickly. \"Many people think that speaking to people is about your command of language, or your ability to convince other people of your opinion. Those are certainly facets of communication, but they are only small pieces of the whole.\"Communication is most effective when you keep three things in mind. First, your audience's attitude will mirror your attitude, so if you are not positive and relaxed, your message will likely fall on deaf ears. Second, your audience's time is important, so make sure you are being brief and clear. Third, stay away from complex language that takes specific knowledge to understand. Keeping these three things in mind is going to drastically improve both your casual conversation and your formal speeches. Let's spend some time unpacking them.\"As Deacon Errul continued to teach, Thorn listened carefully, making notes. After the lesson was over, the deacon called in a few other disciples and let Thorn practice having conversations with them. To help Thorn and the other disciples practice, Deacon Errul organized them into a rotation, having each spend a few minutes speaking on a topic that he proposed. At first, it was intimidating for Thorn to stand up at the front to speak to the crowd of disciples. However, as time went on, his words became smoother, flowing naturally from his tongue.Deacon Errul set a variety of topics for them to talk about, and after a few rounds of practice, Thorn was able to take the stage without any nervousness. In between each disciple's speech, the Deacon pointed out a few things that the disciple could do better the next round. Thorn found it as helpful to listen to other people speak as it allowed him to identify weaknesses of his own.At first, Thorn was unsure how much public speaking he was going to have to do to increase his [Oration Proficiency] ability, but as he practiced, he began to feel his speaking proficiency improving at a measurable rate.*ding* After a few hours of practice, the class was called to a close and Thorn stood, putting his seat away. Saluting the other disciples and his teacher, Thorn could feel that his new ability [Apprentice Orator] had improved his abilities significantly over the last two hours. As he looked through his abilities to see what had changed, he noticed that his [Pack Travel] ability had gotten an upgrade. Heading back to the throne room, Thorn saw Corvo hurrying toward him with Velin in tow. The two elves presented a pretty picture as they walked next to each other, talking quietly. Elves were a beautiful race with delicate features and brilliant eyes, and both Velin and Corvo were above average. Velin was dressed in a deep blue robe with golden stitching forming a large tree running up the right side from her waist to her shoulder. Her every movement was precise and contained an ethereal grace that made Thorn wonder about her background. Next to her, Corvo still wore the ragged cloak, presenting a sloppy look. Yet, despite the tattered state of his clothing, it only served to add some mystery to him. \"Did you find anything?\" Without waiting for them to approach, Thorn strode over.\"Yes.\" Corvo answered first. \"I've connected with our network. There are stone dwarves appearing all over Angoril. They look like statues that you might find in a Dwarven ruin. They run in groups of three to ten, and they are very aggressive. They are strong too, with natural armor due to their stone skin. When they die, they freeze for a few hours and then melt back into the ground. Same thing happens when they get broken.\"His brow furrowing slightly, Thorn looked at Velin, who had her notebook out.\"We encountered three groups outside of Embersplit. Reports suggest that they are exiting the mine on a one hour interval and spreading out in all directions. I would guess that the mine has an entrance into the subterranean world, and that one of the fortresses is down there. We also ran into Ragnarok in the area.\"\"Did they give you any trouble?\" Thorn's eyes narrowed at the mention of the enemy guild.\"Nothing more than traded insults. However, it is highly likely that they know as much or more than we do, so I suggest we move as quickly as possible.\" Seeing Thorn's confused look, Velin raised her eyebrows in question.\"Sorry, I'm just wondering what got into everyone. Why are we suddenly running around like chickens with our heads cut off just because of a quest? We have a lot to do to get the valley into shape.\"\"Not just a quest.\" Velin closed her notebook and looked squarely at Thorn. \"This is World Quest. I forget that you have not been playing long enough to have experienced this before. World Quests are universal quests that everyone participates in. They only appear when a new region or map is about to open up. You might think of them like an expansion.\"\"That explains why everyone is so excited, but what is the rush?\" \"Simple. The new maps always have some sort of new race or faction that requires reputation to interact with. The last expansion, the Battlefield of Flame and Shadow, has the Order of Flame, and the Order of Shadow. If you want to play on or explore the battlefield, you need to grind reputation, a process that normally takes a really long time. The World Quests provide a shortcut. When the Battlefield first appeared, the guilds that completed the World Quest got a jump start by automatically gaining reputation. They also got bases in the Battlefield.\"\"Oh, wow. Okay. Now I know why we are rushing.\"\"Exactly, guild-wide reputation boosts and guild property are extremely valuable.\"\"Let's do it. Get a team together. It will take the team a few days to get there, so I'll go on ahead first. I'll wait for you at the entrance to the mine. Send me a message if you have anything else. Keep up the good work.\" Smiling at his two advisors, Thorn sent a quick message to the members of the Titan squad, telling them to meet him at the gate as quickly as possible.Within an hour, the players had all gathered, standing around Thorn. Mina was the last to arrive, as she had still been logged out when Thorn sent the message. \"What's going on?\" The short witch started to poke Thorn in the side, but thought better of it when she saw the rest of the team looking at her.\"We think we found an entrance for the World Quest. We are going to act as the vanguard and hold spots for the other two teams. Everyone ready to travel? Okay, let's go.\"Setting out from the fortress, the whole group began to jog toward Embersplit. After they left the pass, Thorn activated his [Pack Travel] ability. A faint silhouette of a running wolf covered each of the team members, and their speed immediately increased by fifty percent. Dashing forward, each step seemed to carry them farther than normal, allowing the group to cover distance at a tremendous rate.The journey to Embersplit would normally take a few days of walking, but since the players could travel without resting, the journey was cut down to only a single night. As dawn broke over the misty forests, the rundown town of Embersplit came into focus. Without stopping, the Titan team pushed past the town and approached the Embersplit Mine. Once they got closer, they began to hear the sounds of weapons clashing.\"Hold.\" Calling for everyone to stop, Thorn listened carefully. He could hear metal ringing on metal but also the grating of metal on stone. \"Whoever is at the entrance is probably fighting those statues that were reported. Let's form up. Standard assault formation.\"Quickly reorganizing, the tanks stood out front while the ranged DPS and support stood behind them. Melee DPS stood on either side of the formation, ready to dash forward once the tanks had locked down the enemy. Standing at the head of the formation, Thorn glanced over his shoulder at the rest of the team.\"Let's go.\" His deep voice rumbling over the group, Thorn led the way forward. Soon the battlefield came into view. In the distance, Thorn could see three groups of players fighting against waves of grey stone figures. As Thorn got closer, he could make out the Nova Luna insignia on the smallest group of players, so he led his team straight toward them. The four scouts were nearly surrounded by a swarm of stone dwarves. Rushing forward, Thorn signaled the rest of the Titan squad to attack at will. Rushing into the battlefield, Thorn led the charge, smashing aside the short stone figures as he went. Swinging his tetsubo in a wide arc, Thorn felt the impact of his attack reverberating through his hand. The thick stone armor of the dwarves made them all but impervious to sharp weapons, but it did little to protect them against brute force. Smashing into the mobs, Thorn focused on disrupting as many enemies as possible while he forged his way toward the team of scouts, putting into practice everything he had learned from Master Sun. Mina was the next to arrive at the scouts, her ice magic in full force. Behind her, the rest of the Titan squad quickly got into the action, forcefully pushing their way toward the scouts. Pausing next to the leader of the scouts, Thorn glanced down.\"What is the situation?\" \"These little buggers came out of nowhere about half an hour ago.\" The ranger panted, glad to be given a moment of respite. \"We were keeping watch on the entrance to the mine with the other two guilds when High Castle's dungeon team arrived and some of them immediately entered. Their guild leader is over there. We thought about stopping them, but they had too many players. They were in the mine for about an hour when Aurum's team arrived. Just as Aurum was about to enter the mine, a ton of these stone dwarves popped out of the entrance and began to attack us. It is a good thing you got here when you did; I don't know that we would have been able to hold on much longer.\"\"Did the other group come out yet?\" Thorn's brow furrowed as he scanned the battlefield.\"No.\" Shaking his head, the ranger pointed to the flood of dwarves streaming out of the mine entrance. \"We have not seen anyone come out besides the mobs.\"\"Good work. We will worry about the guilds later. For now, let's focus on getting rid of these mobs.\"An ever-increasing number of enemies were pouring out of the mine to surrounded them. The dwarves stomped forward, their stone weapons rising and chopping down with mechanical precision. So far, they had been held back because of their clumsy movements, but soon they would overrun the battle line that the tanks had established in front of Thorn's position. Realizing that there was no way for them to survive without stemming the increasing number of dwarves entering the battlefield, Thorn stepped to the front line.\"Melee, push forward. Support, keep the tanks up. Flankers, don't get bogged down. We're moving into the mine entrance.\" Activating [Wolf's Rage] Thorn flexed his fingers around the handle of his tetsubo as his eyes turned red. With a resounding, roar he burst forward, crushing his way through the enemies. The pulsing wave of sound from his [Wolf Lord's Howl] rippled through the stone enemies and, taking advantage of the mobs' stunned state, he called for the Titan squad to advance.Pushing forward into the void left in Thorn's wake, the tanks raced to keep up with their charging leader. The ranged support behind them fired as they advanced, keeping up a steady barrage of attacks on the enemy and heals on the tanks. Alongside the group, Rogues and Rangers wove through the enemy, doing their best to prevent them from slowing the charge. Thorn's furious assault carried him straight to the entrance of the mine, where a few blows from his tetsubo cleared enough space for the tanks to set up.\"Hold this position.\" His deep voice carried easily over the battlefield. \"I'll clean up the mobs outside.\" Turning to the other two Guilds who were still surrounded, Thorn blurred into action once again. Master Sun's training came in handy as Thorn spun his tetsubo. The sheer force of his attacks smashed the dwarves into pieces, cracking their armor and sending fractures through their bodies. Unwilling to waste the remaining minutes of his rage, Thorn grabbed one of the Dwarves by the head and started swinging him around like an impromptu club. Smashing stone Dwarves with the statue he was wielding in one hand, he struck with his tetsubo in the other quickly clearing a large area. When that dwarf broke off at the legs he discarded it and grabbed another. Within minutes the area outside the mine was completely clear, leaving the two guilds facing a raging giant.\u00a0-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi Everyone!

A few of the players clustered up tighter as Thorn's eyes passed by. Seeing the players' subtle retreat, Thorn's lips twitched. Turning his head, he called back to the Titan squad in the mine's entrance. \"How are you guys doing?\" At the front of the squad, six tanks stood shoulder to shoulder, completely blocking the entrance. The narrow entrance made it impossible for more than eight dwarves to attack at once. With the support players behind them, the tanks had no problem defending themselves from the incoming horde, causing the stream of attacking enemies to pile up in the choke point. \"We could hold them here for a year if we needed to,\" Mina said, casually blasting a stone dwarf apart with a giant ice spear. \"You handle the negotiations, we got this.\"Striding over to the Aurum dungeon team, Thorn waved the High Castle team over. After some hesitation, three players made their way over, and Thorn introduced himself.\"Hello. My name is Thorn, the guild leader of Nova Luna.\"\"I am Asher.\" A dark robed player stepped out of Aurum's team and held out his hand.Grinning slightly, Thorn shook the proffered hand, his massive hand engulfing Asher's.\"Pleased to meet you, Asher.\" Thorn glanced over at the three High Castle players who were approaching. \"My scouts tell me that the High Castle team is already inside the dungeon. It looks like we are going to have to fight our way through if we want to catch up. Would you be interested in cooperating with us to push in?\"\"Cooperating?\" The magician's face was calm, but his hands nervously tugging at the hem of his sleeve betrayed him.\"Yes. We have no interest in monopolizing this entrance. Rather, we'd love to work together with other local guilds to make sure we don't get pushed out by larger guilds.\"\"That sounds good, but what happens if there is one of those fortresses down there?\" one of the players walking over asked, his voice sharp.\"If we find a fortress, we either take turns attempting to capture it, or we capture it together.\" Unruffled, Thorn flashed a winning smile. \"None of our guilds is big enough to stand against the super guilds, but working together, we are more than a match for them. No need to let them benefit from something in our backyard.\"\"We would certainly be interested in cooperating with you.\" Asher's eyes lit up, and the magician glanced at the leader of the High Castle group. \"What do you say, Cloudy? \"\"I'm WhiteCloud.\" Waving to Thorn, the player that had just been addressed introduced himself. WhiteCloud was a short human dressed in leather armor who carried a shortbow on his back. \"So long as everyone agrees to give us a fair shake at the fortress, we're open to cooperation.\"\"Good. Then we're agreed.\" Asher's face broke into a smile. \"Cloudy, you sent a team in already, right? Want to share what is going on?\"\"Sure. We sent a team into the dungeon almost two hours ago, and we have not heard anything from them since. It seems there is a communication block of some sort. We are trying to work around it, but so far we don't have anything. If you want to try pushing into the dungeon, we are happy to help.\"*ding*Just then Thorn got a message from Corvo. \"Hey, Jorge.\" Thorn called the dwarf over. \"Corvo says that Ragnarok is on their way. Can you grab a couple other scouts and keep an eye out?\"\"Ragnarok? Why are they coming?\" WhiteCloud's face paled as he heard Thorn's word. \"Why would they be coming here?\"\"Probably on account of Nova Luna,\" Asher said, tossing a glance at Thorn. \"I heard through the grapevine that Nova Luna and Ragnarok are not on friendly terms.\"\"That is because we are awesome and they suck,\" Mina chimed in, earning herself an eye roll from everyone who heard her.\"It's true,\" Thorn admitted, \"not that we're awesome and they suck, but we've had some conflict before. It wouldn't surprise me if they are sending a team specifically to try and disrupt us. According to the report, we should be expecting the Silver Guard to show up, but as long as they don't bring their full force, we should be fine.\"\"Have you ever fought the Silver Guard?\" WhiteCloud made no effort to hide his skepticism. \"No, but we've crushed the Blood Guard and Crimson Snakes.\"\"Ha, those wannabes are not even in the same league.\" The leader of the High Castle team scoffed. \"The Silver Guard is the real deal. They are probably one of the strongest teams in Nova Terra.\"\"Not probably, definitely.\" Asher joined the conversation.\"What makes them so good? I've seen them around, but I don't know anything about how they fight.\"\"Their main advantage is in their class, Silver Guard. It is a heavy armor support and combat class with stupidly high magic resistance. On top of being really tanky, they get buffs from being around other Silver Guard, which means that when they get into formation they are nearly impossible to crack.\"\"The real problem, though, is [Holy Strike]. Their one attack ability stacks, allowing a group to deal huge spike damage.\" Mina joined the group, her face serious. \"One [Holy Strike] is almost worthless if it isn't being used against an undead or devil, but once you reach master level, there is a hidden trigger that allows multiple players to combine their [Holy Strike]. Two players working together will triple the damage, three players get six times the damage, and it only goes up from there. On top of that, when you hit five players it also applies a burning effect. They are gross when they team up.\"\"Huh, that sounds really dangerous.\" Thorn scratched his head. \"If we go up against them, we will have to try and disrupt them. Anyway, no sense in worrying about that now. Let's talk about how we're going to enter the mine.\"Organizing all of the players in the three guilds into equal groups, WhiteCloud, Asher, and Thorn each took command of one group and entered the mine. Thorn and the Titan squad took point, pushing forward into the mine while the High Castle and Aurum groups followed behind. It took a while to grind their way through the tightly-packed dwarves at the entrance, but after an hour and a half of heavy fighting, they broke through to the other side.Once they passed the mine's entrance, they found themselves in an area with branching tunnels. The mine tunnels were barely large enough for Thorn to stand up straight and not nearly wide enough for him to swing his tetsubo, so he swapped it out for his arbalest and joined the support players in the back. After looking around, a scout from the High Castle team reported that the High Castle dungeon team had marked the path that they traveled and led them down a tunnel to the left. \"We'll take a turn up front,\" WhiteCloud volunteered, earning himself a look of approval from Asher and Thorn.Thorn signaled for the Titan squad to step back, and the High Castle team advanced to take their place. Due to their low numbers, the High Castle team was comprised of a mix of players from all three guilds. As they begin to clear the way forward, the Titan squad moved to the back of the group to rest.The group advanced deeper into the earth. At times, the passage would narrow, forcing the group to move forward in single file. Occasionally, Thorn even had to pause to widen the path, due to his size. After they had traveled for two hours, the slow trickle of dwarves heading towards the surface stopped, and the High Castle team, which was currently at the front, called back that they could see an open space.The narrow passageway opened into a huge cavern. Close to a quarter of a mile across, the ground was rough, and faintly glowing plants and fungi dotted the room. Large stalactites hung from the ceiling, looming over their heads like the teeth of a giant beast waiting to crunch shut. Spreading out as they entered the cavern, the three teams looked around. It was as if they had entered a massive, shadowy world. Mina poked Thorn in the side and spoke in a whisper.\"I don't like this place.\"\"Yeah, it's not very cheery, is it?\" In the low light provided by the glowing plants, Thorn could make out a well-worn path curving its way through the cavern. *ding* Replying quickly, Thorn dismissed Jorge's message, his mind whirring. After a moment, he looked around, his expression unchanged.\"Let's push forward.\"Once again, the Titan squad took point, advancing across the cavern floor. Despite the size of the group, everyone was subdued. The only sound was their muffled footfalls. Halfway across the cavern, Mina heard a skittering sound and spotted a large insect with countless legs creeping behind some rocks.Stifling a shriek with her hand, Mina thrust her wand out and cast a spell, dumping a ton of snow on the helpless creature's head. All three teams, startled by the sudden attack, took defensive stances, looking around warily for enemies. No one was able to spot anything, and after a moment, Mina sheepishly admitted what had happened. Rolling his eyes, Thorn patted the short witch on the head.\"Please don't tell me that you are going to do that for every insect we come across down here.\"\"No, no, I'm good.\" Mina patted her chest in relief. \"I was just startled.\"\"Good. Keep it together,\" Asher said as he walked over to Thorn. \"Looks like it wasn't anything, so let's keep moving.\"\"Yeah, she can get a little bit trigger-happy.\" Thorn smirked as he waved to the group. \"The path looks like it ends at the base of that pile of stones. Split up and see if you can find the exit.\"The three teams split up and began to comb through the cavern. With his height, Thorn had no trouble seeing over the plants and rock piles, and his night vision made the low light conditions a non-issue. Wandering around a large pile of rocks, Thorn was looking at a large pink and yellow mushroom that was puffing out jets of phosphorescent blue mist when he began to hear shouts from across the cavern.\"[Avalanche!]\" Standing up, Thorn looked over just in time to see Mina summon her three frozen orbs.\"Mina, what are you doing?\"\"[Raging Blizzard!]\" Not stopping to answer Thorn, Mina began casting ice spikes as fast as she could muster. Shards of ice ripped through the air, smashing into the ground and sending slivers of razor sharp ice flying. Mina accelerated backward, sliding over the ground and ramping off of a small bump. As she flew through the air, she spun around and pointed her wand. \"[Sub Zero!]\" The spell had barely been released when she activated her blink, appearing fifteen feet away as scything mandibles cut through the air where she had been moments before. Realizing something serious was going on, Thorn's voice boomed through the cavern, causing the stones on the floor to jump.\"Form up!\"\"You heard him.\" Without waiting to figure out what was going on, Asher yelled to his group, and began to sprint toward where Thorn stood. Across the cavern, WhiteCloud's team looked to their leader, who hesitated for a moment, his eyes darting to a half hidden opening in the cavern wall. *BOOM*The loud sound drew his eyes back to Mina's fleeing figure. Through the cloud of ice crystals, WhiteCloud could barely make out a huge armored figure weaving in the air, thousands of small legs wriggling in and out of sight. From what he could make out, a forty-foot monstrous centipede was chasing Mina back toward Thorn's party.\"Are we going back to fight?\" One of the scouts asked, his eyes fixed on the massive centipede that was pursuing Mina.\"No. Let them fight it. It should keep them tied up while we meet up with the rest of the team. They said they can see the fortress already. Let's go.\" Without another glance, WhiteCloud led his small team into the hidden cavern.In the center of the cavern, Thorn focused on the giant centipede that was barreling toward them. Imposing armor plates covered the arthropod's back and sides, creating a low grinding noise as it rushed after the fleeing witch. Lunging out of the cloud of ice, the centipede sent it's scything mandibles snapping toward Mina, who blinked away again. His guildmates gathered up around him, Asher arrived next to the Titan squad, which had formed up in front of Thorn. Grimacing at the incoming monster, Asher commanded his group to join Thorn's. Quickly getting into position, the tanks rushed forward to intercept the enraged insect. Another blink brought Mina to safety behind the tank line, where she hid behind Thorn. \"Ugh, gross, gross, gross.\" \"Are you okay?\"\"Oh, yeah. I'm fine. Ew, that thing is so disgusting.\"\"What happened?\" Looking at the monster, Thorn tried to figure out where it had come from.\"Ummm. I might have killed one of its kids or something,\" Mina said, sheepishly.\"Hey, let's deal with it before we all die, huh?\" Exasperated, Asher pointed toward the tanks, who were being tossed all over by the rampaging beast.\"Haha, right. Support, keep the tanks up. Let's do this,\" Thorn called out, striding forward. Fixing his helmet on his head, he summoned his tetsubo and rushed toward the giant monster, Mina skating forward behind him.\u00a0-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi Everyone!

Mages, do your best to slow it down! Make sure we keep those tanks at full health in case it has a rage ability.\" Rather than follow Thorn and Mina forward into the heart of the fight, Asher took command of the back line, shouting out orders in rapid-fire succession. With a practiced eye, Asher began to assess the battlefield.Smashing his way across the floor of the cavern, Thorn could feel the burning excitement taking hold of him. Roaring, he launched himself into the air, lifting his tetsubo over his head. But before he could strike, the giant centipede's tail appeared in front of him, lashing him out of the air. Thorn went tumbling, a grunt slipping from his lips as his large armored form smashed through piles of rocks and completely squashed a giant mushroom. Extricating himself from the sticky mess of glowing fungus, Thorn shook his head and stood up.Standing among the support players, Asher called out orders to the tanks.\"Set up a taunt chain starting from the left and taunt on my order! DPS, rotate on my command until agro is established. Zeno, you are first!\" Asher kept his eyes tightly fixed on the giant centipede. Seeing an opening, he shouted, \"Taunt!\"Zeno, a barbarian dressed in fur-lined steel armor, slammed the butt of his double-sided axe into the ground, activating his crowd control ability. The shockwave from the strike flowed outward, sending glowing yellow chains shooting out of the ground to tie down the centipede. With a hiss, the centipede tried to retreat, but the flying chains were too fast, wrapping around it.The ability infuriated the monster, drawing its attention for a second. The centipede locked its multitude of eyes on Zeno, making him gulp. The chains had barely finished wrapping around it when the centipede shook its body, shattering the chains and breaking free from the restraint. Asher's voice rang from the back line, and Zeno jumped backwards, barely evading a pincer strike from the centipede. Furious at having missed, the centipede reared back its head to strike again.\"Next tank, taunt!\"A tank to the right of Zeno smashed the pommel of his sword on his shield, producing a sharp *klang*. As if by magic, the centipede's gaze swiveled to fix itself onto the offending shield, and without hesitating, it lunged forward. Just as it looked like the centipede's giant mandibles were about to cut the tank in half, a translucent sphere of reverberating sound appeared in the air around the warrior's body, blocking the monster's attack.\"DPS, on!\" Asher called out, and all of the ranged attackers began to pepper the monster from afar with spells and arrows. The melee DPS dashed forward, swinging sharply at the centipede's thick carapace. On the count of three, all of the DPS stopped attacking, and Asher called for the third tank to draw the centipede's attention. In fascination, Thorn watched as Asher took hold of the tempo of the fight, perfectly timing his orders to keep the monster busy while creating opportunities for the damage dealers to strike.Not wanting to throw off the rhythm that Asher had established, Thorn switched his tetsubo for his arbalest, joining the ranged attackers in sending bolts toward the centipede every time Asher called out for damage. Even though most of the tank's abilities could only hold the monster's attention for a few seconds, the rapid rotation of the crowd control abilities and taunts kept the giant centipede disoriented enough that it could never mount a large attack.As they repeated the rotation, Thorn was drawn into the rhythm of the fight. A tank would taunt, pulling the giant centipede's attention, and in the brief seconds before it reoriented itself, the DPS would strike. Wave after wave, the attacks hammered its carapace, chipping away at the monster's impressive armor. It didn't take long before the mighty monster fell, worn down by the relentless damage.Quite impressed with the way the fight had gone, Thorn slapped Asher on the back, nearly knocking him over.\"That was awesome. Really impressive control of the battlefield.\"\"Uh, thanks? I guess?\" Seeing Asher's confused look, Mina rolled her eyes.\"Pay no attention. Our boss is just a giant noob.\" Now it was Thorn's turn to be confused. \"Thorn, that was just a standard dungeon battle. Probably not even a mini boss.\" As realization dawned on Thorn's face, Mina continued. \"I forgot that you have never seen the way normal people fight. No one else in the game can just rush in and crush everything the way you do. We have to use tactics and strategy like the ones you saw here. Literally every elite player in the game knows this rotation. And this is only one of the standard rotations.\"\"Well, anyway, I was impressed.\" Unashamed of his lack of knowledge, Thorn gave Asher a thumbs up. \"You will have to teach me about these rotations. I feel like it would be really helpful to understand how you know when to taunt and when to attack.\"\"That just comes with time. You have to observe the monster and figure out their pattern. In this case, it only had two real attack vectors. Head and tail. Most monsters telegraph their moves, so if you can spot the sign that they are about to attack, you can taunt to interrupt them. The strategy we used here only works with multiple teams, because you need enough tanks to pull aggro for the constant interrupt. It was also easier since this monster wasn't a boss and didn't have a rage ability.\"Talking while they worked, Asher and Thorn gathered the group together after they had finished looting the giant centipede. Thorn pointed toward the side of the cavern where WhiteCloud and the High Castle team had disappeared.\"WhiteCloud was over there when the fight started. It is pretty safe to assume that he found the exit and is on his way to the fortress.\" Everyone followed Thorn's finger but did not see anything but a dark wall.\"How do you figure?\" Asher asked.\"Well, first of all, WhiteCloud lied about not being able to send and receive messages. I would guess that means he probably knew that the giant centipede was here and was waiting for someone to stumble on it before making his escape. Second, if he was still in the cavern, he would have come out by now.\"\"That makes sense.\"\"Let's concentrate our search near that wall. I'm sure we'll find the passage there.\"After a brief rest, the two guilds made their way to the wall of the cavern where WhiteCloud and his men had disappeared, a quick search revealing the passage. The entrance to the tunnel was hidden behind a small outcropping of rock, and it was only when a player stood directly next to it that he could see it.\"Slimy...\" Asher cursed under his breath. \"I bet WhiteCloud knew which way to go all along. He is probably already at the fortress by now, trying to get a leg up.\"\"Don't worry.\" Thorn's voice was slow and calm. \"Even if High Castle got to the fortress already, I'm sure we'll be able to catch up. I know that the quest only says we need to find the fortress, but given that all the stone dwarves have been aggressive, I am willing to bet that we'll have to conquer the fortress to advance. The chance of High Castle being able to take down a fortress of stone dwarves with just a dungeon team is slim to none.\"\"But what about the Silver Guard?\" Mina cast a worried glance to the entrance of the cavern.\"Since they're here, we might as well use them.\" Thorn chuckled. \"I told Jorge about the hidden entrance and asked him to try and lead them to us. Peacefully. Since they've come all this way, they might as well help us take down the fortress, right?\"\"Do you really think they'll help us?\"\"Sure, why not?\" Thorn shrugged. \"Either way, it won't hurt to ask. If we are going to fight, then we should just get it over with so we can get on with taking down the fortress.\"Asher looked skeptical, but he didn't say anything. Gathering their teams together, the Aurum team led the way into the earth.Less than 20 minutes later, a well-ordered group of silver-armored players entered the cavern. Seeing the devastation wrought by the giant centipede, the Silver Guard stayed in formation, looking around carefully for any sign of an enemy. The cavern was silent, all the small creatures that inhabited it scared off by the fight against the giant centipede. Unable to spot anything out of the ordinary in the dim conditions, the leaders gathered to discuss what to do next.\"Oi, the exit is this way.\" Instantly the Silver Guard were on high alert, spinning to face Jorge, who had just stepped out from behind a blue glowing mushroom, his hands resting on his daggers. Stretching one hand out, he activated his Guild insignia, the symbol for Nova Luna appearing above his palm. \"My boss told me to wait for you, so I can show you the way down.\"The leader of the Silver Guard was an older man, his worn face a map of the vicissitudes of life. Stepping forward, he sized up Jorge carefully.\"Hello, Jorge. It's been awhile.\"\"Well if it isn't Raeth.\" Jorge's eyes never left the grizzled old man. \"Fancy meeting you here. When did you get promoted?\"\"Oh, a couple weeks ago.\" Rather than looking at Jorge, the old man's eyes wandered the nearby landscape, watching carefully for any sign of an ambush. Raeth's extreme caution made Jorge chuckle. Dropping his hands from his daggers, he held them out wide.\"No trickery here, old friend. The boss man wants to meet you in front of the fortress.\"\"Does he? And who is your new boss now that you abandoned Ouroboros?\"\"Get this straight, old man, I did not abandon anyone.\" Jorge's tone was hard. \"Thorn. Guild leader of Nova Luna, Lord Greymane the Moon Wolf. Giant guy. Impossible to miss. Come on, you outnumber me 50 to 1, don't tell me you are scared.\"\"And you said Thorn wants to meet us? Why? Last time I checked, we were not on friendly terms.\"\"Look, all he told me is that he wants to meet. Now, either you follow me, or you find the way yourself.\"Raeth scratched his chin, scrutinizing Jorge's face for any sign of duplicity.\"All right, we'll follow you and see what this Thorn has to say.\"\"Haha good. You won't regret it.\" Leading the way to the exit, Jorge headed straight down the tunnel, the well-ordered Silver Guard marching in step behind him.Farther down the tunnel, one of Asher's Scouts reported having found the end of the tunnel up ahead. As they rounded a bend in the tunnel, Asher could see torchlight from what seemed to be another large cavern. Falling back to the center of the group, he approached Thorn to ask him what he thought about the situation.\"My guess is that High Castle has set up to ambush us when we exit the tunnel. That is assuming that they have not entered or attacked the fortress, of course.\"\"My thoughts exactly.\" Asher nodded, frowning grimly. \"How do we want to handle this?\"\"Well,\" said Thorn, thinking out loud, \"we don't have a way to go around it, which means we have to walk through the choke point. I think our only option is to bust through. How about this: I'll take point and try to disrupt them as much as possible. Everyone else can follow up after I charge.\"\"I think you are right. Say when you're ready to charge, and we will buff you to help with damage mitigation.\"Grinning, Thorn quickly organized the Titan squad and walked to the front of the group. Dropping into a crouch, his eyes fixed on the end of the tunnel. Taking a deep breath, he exhaled and then nodded to Asher.\"Buff him up.\"Instantly, multiple magical glows landed on Thorn, filling him full of energy and making his body feel as if it could float off the ground. Under his helmet, Thorn's grin grew wider.[Wolf's Rage]As the burning excitement in his chest spread to his limbs, Thorn took off. Each long step sent him hurtling down the tunnel, faster and faster. Each pounding footfall carved a divot into the floor, sending shards of stone and clumps of dirt flying. Following as closely as they could, the two squads raced to keep up.Just before he got to the entrance to the cavern, Thorn focused his mind and summoned an extra burst of speed, the impact from his feet sending tremors through the earth. Lifting his arms to help block against attacks, Thorn sprinted out of the tunnel. As he blasted through the entrance like a cannonball, Thorn caught a brief glimpse of the horrified faces of High Castle players spread around the entrance.A storm of attacks landed around Thorn, a few barely clipping him as he rushed through. Moving as fast as he was, Thorn was unable to change directions in time as a large stalagmite loomed in his path. Gritting his teeth, Thorn could only lower his shoulder and brace for impact.*Boom*The impact rumbled through the cavern as chunks of stone went flying, sending the members of High Castle scrambling for safety. Undeterred, Thorn continued his headlong rush, leaving the High Castle players behind, their mouths wide open. Pouring out of the tunnel, Mina and the Titan squad attacked immediately as Asher led his team in support. The entrance to the cavern was soon filled with the clang of steel and angry shouts as the three teams fell into battle.It took Thorn a few seconds just to slow down. Planting his feet firmly as he came to a stop, he brushed shards of stone from his armor and launched himself back in the opposite direction. As he ran back, he spotted WhiteCloud standing at the back of the High Castle army, his short bow thrumming as he sent arrow after arrow arcing into the melee.[Shadow Dash]Appearing abruptly next to the short ranger, Thorn did not hold back. A sweeping blow with his tetsubo forced WhiteCloud out of the game instantly, and two quick strikes brought down his guildmates who were standing nearby. Set loose in the middle of the enemy, Thorn was like a bull in a china shop, smashing players into oblivion left and right. It was a moment before the High Castle team realized that their leader had fallen, but when they did, they panicked and began to flee.After finishing off the last of the High Castle players, Thorn, Mina, and Asher began to look around the cavern. It did not take long for them to spot the fortress set back against one of the cavern walls.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi Everyone!

Carved stone walls flanked a yawning entryway, the sharp teeth of a portcullis poking from the arch like a mouth about to snap shut. With his excellent eyesight, Thorn could faintly make out row after row of stone dwarves standing stiffly on the walls, holding spears. Despite the open gateway, the fortress gave off a gloomy feeling, as if it would swallow anyone who stepped inside.\"Do you think that is the fortress we are supposed to find?\" Mina asked.\"The quest did say it was a fortress underground.\" Thorn shrugged. Taking a few steps toward the fortress, a familiar sound rang in his ear.*ding* \"There we go. What do you think?\" Thorn looked toward Mina and Asher, who were reading over their own notifications. \"10,000 dwarves? Are they insane?\" Asher muttered to himself as he read the quest description. \"It looks like we need to work together if we want to have any chance of completing this.\" Thorn scratched his head, his eyes fixed on the looming fortress. \"Our dungeon team is still about a day away, so I think we should rest here until they join us. Oh, and the Silver Guard can help out, as well. Jorge connected with them, and they should be here within 10 minutes.\"\"I still can't believe you think that they are going to help us.\" Asher shook his head\"Ha, not help us, help themselves. Not to boast, but we've got a pretty solid team here, and together, I'm positive we will be able to clear this fortress. Once we do, everyone who helps will get access to this labyrinth city or whatever. No matter what our differences are, I am sure Ragnarok will not turn down another shot at this dungeon.\"\"Yeah, we'll see.\" Shrugging, still unconvinced, Asher walked over to tell his guildmates what was going on.Thorn kept an eye on the fortress while Mina watched the tunnel exit. Just as he was appreciating the size of the stones that made up the fortress' wall, Mina called out in a low voice.\"Incoming.\"Turning to face the tunnel's exit, Thorn stood together with the rest of the Titan squad. The sound of metal shod boots clanging against the stone floor soon became audible, and marching three abreast, the Silver Guard entered the cavern behind Jorge.\"See, I told you that you would not be able to miss him.\" Chuckling, the dwarf gestured to Thorn. Waving his hand, the older Silver Guard captain marched up to Thorn, the ranks of Silver Guard behind him keeping up neatly.\"My name is Raeth, captain of the Silver Guard. I'm here to represent Ragnarok for this dungeon.\" His eyes cold, the old man was clearly not impressed by Thorn's size.\"Hello, Captain. I am Baron Thorn Greymane, the Moon Wolf. This is Asher, leader of Aurum. We are happy to have you here, as it looks like we will need all hands on deck if we want to complete this quest.\"\"You have a quest?\"\"Yes. Here.\" Thorn shared the updated World Quest with the captain.At first, Raeth's face was passive, but as he got to the end of the quest window, his brow furrowed, and he looked at Thorn, a grudging light in his eyes. \"Let me know when you are ready, and we can begin the assault.\"\"I am afraid we will be waiting until tomorrow, as we still have team members who are on their way.\" \"You expect us to wait until tomorrow?\" Raeth scoffed, \"I don't know about you, but some of us have important things to do. Maybe it's better if I took charge of this mission.\"\"Pleasant as always, Raeth.\" Mina's voice sounded from behind Thorn, and though her tone was pleasant, the temperature seemed to drop a few degrees.\"Hello, Mina. I see you found a new master,\" the Ragnarok captain sneered.Mina's response was to draw her wand, causing the Silver Guard behind Raeth to draw their swords all at once.\"Whoa there, hold up. No need for this to turn into a scuffle.\" Thorn's deep voice was soothing, immediately easing tensions. \"We are all here for the same reasons - let's not lose sight of our goals. Tell you what. If you would like to take a crack at the fortress to see if you can complete the quest on your own, I have no problem with that. As for us, we are going to wait for the rest of our team.\"About to argue, Raeth felt the hair on the back of his neck rise. His eyes flickered as he noticed the razor sharp claws on Thorn's hand. A quick glance around showed that Jorge was nowhere to be seen.\"Fine. We'll wait.\" Turning away from Thorn abruptly, Raeth led his group to the side, allowing them to disperse. \"Be back at oh nine hundred hours tomorrow.\"\"What do you want to do while we wait?\" Mina asked, watching as some of the Silver Guard players logged out and others stood together to talk.\"Anyone who wants to can log out till 9 a.m. tomorrow. Those that want to stay should help to sweep roaming mobs while we wait for the rest of the team to arrive. We need to prevent the number of stone dwarves from building up before we start the assault.\"All but three of the Titan squad decided to stay and help clear out the stone dwarves from the surrounding tunnels, so Thorn split the party into three groups and sent them in different directions along with the members of Aurum who were sticking around. It had been quite an eventful day, so Thorn found a good spot on the ground and sat down, leaning against a stalagmite as he waited for Velin to arrive.The dark cavern was gloomy, and the pressure emitted by the fortress was heavy, but once he got over being stared at by a few thousand dwarves on the wall of the fortress, Thorn found the dim environment was actually quite peaceful. It had been a while since Thorn relaxed, so he took full advantage of the opportunity, stretching out and doing his best to sleep. The rest of the night passed quickly, and at 7 a.m. the next morning, Velin arrived with the rest of the professional players from Nova Luna. Excited to see her friend, Mina rushed over while Thorn and Jorge followed behind.\"Finally! You're here,\" Mina whined, earning herself a slight smile from the beautiful elf.\"Welcome, Velin, Oberlin.\" Thorn nodded to the two officers. \"How tired is everyone? Do you need any rest before we begin the assault?\"\"Hey, boss. Maybe just a couple minutes to get reorganized. We are pretty well rested, since Velin let us camp out for a while last night. She said we would be fighting right away today, so we are all ready.\"\"Good.\" Thorn patted Velin on her shoulder gently. \"Great thinking, Velin. Oh, let me introduce you. This is Asher. He is heading up the Aurum team that we will be working with for the assault on the fortress. Asher, this is Velin and this is Oberlin, two of Nova Luna's officers.\"\"Pleased to meet you.\" Asher flashed his brightest smile, his eyes fixed on Velin's face. Responding with a slight smile and nod, the Elven War Priestess immediately resumed her cold expression, turning her head to talk to Thorn. Completely ignored, Oberlin wasn't upset in the slightest, instead laughing at Asher's enamoured look.\"Now that everyone is introduced, let's go see when our friends from Ragnarok will be ready.\" Walking the short distance to where Raeth and a few of the other Silver Guard were talking quietly, Thorn approached the captain.\"Our gang is all here, and we are ready to go. How does it look on your side?\"\"We are still waiting for the last few stragglers to login. What do you say we start at 9?\" Raeth's face was impassive, not at all embarrassed by Thorn's small jab.\"Haha, sure.\" Thorn waved his hand and begin to head back to the others, saying over his shoulder as he went, \"We will be having a tactical meeting in a couple minutes. Feel free to come and give your two cents, if you would like.\"A few minutes later, Raeth and Asher gathered with a few of their men, meeting Thorn and his team in front of the fortress.\"Thank you both for coming.\" Thorn glanced back and forth between Raeth and Asher. At his side stood Velin, Jorge, Mina and Oberlin. \"We have about half a day before WhiteCloud and the rest of the High Castle team respawn, so if we want to make progress on this quest, we need to get started. Does anyone have anything to say before we start planning?\"\"Yes, I have something to say.\" One of the Silver Guard players who had been standing behind Raeth stepped forward, his eyes sweeping the collected players.\"Sure, go ahead.\"\"Why are you in charge?\" Silence fell over the group at his question and, emboldened, he continued. \"I think Ragnarok is much better suited to be leading this mission then you are. Even Aurum has been around longer than Nova Luna, so why do you get to be in charge?\"\"Okay, thanks for your feedback. Does anyone else have any comments or questions?\"Taken aback by Thorn's passive response, the Silver Guard player was about to lash out when Thorn held up a large finger, making him pause. Thorn looked around at the rest of the group and, seeing that no one else stepped forward with a question, he smiled and turned his full attention to the Silver Guard.\"Your question is not out of line. It is reasonable to ask why I am in charge.\" Taking a small step forward, Thorn straightened to his full height and looked down at the player, a slight smile on his face. \"Simply put, I am leading this quest because I am the strongest person here. I am more than willing to cede the leadership role to anyone who is able to beat me. Would you like to give it a go?\" The weight of Thorn's gaze rested on the Silver Guard player who had stepped out, making it hard for him to breathe. \"No? What about you, Captain Raeth? I am more than willing to entertain a duel if you are interested in giving the leadership role in this quest a shot.\"Silence reigned as Thorn's words faded away. Asher and the few players he had brought from Aurum had stepped back slightly, their eyes fixed on Raeth. Mina, Velin, and Jorge watched as well, curious to see if Ragnarok was going to make an issue of this. His face impassive despite their scrutiny, the Ragnarok captain snorted.\"That will not be necessary. Vance, step back. We will follow Nova Luna's lead in this.\"\"Thank you. I will do my best not to betray your trust.\" Thorn smiled briefly and then got down to business. \"First, a quick recap. Our quest is sending us into the fortress to find the control point. Not only do we have to capture the control point, but we also have to destroy the legion of stone dwarves in the fortress. Jorge has been kind enough to scout the cavern outside of the fortress, giving us a good sense of the terrain we will be covering during our approach. However, we have no idea what the inside of the fortress looks like or where we will find the control point. Any thoughts on this?\"\"That is a lot of Dwarves.\" Mina said, shaking her head as she read over the quest again.\"It is a lot of Dwarves,\" Velin agreed, \"but destroying them shouldn't be a problem. It will just take time. Our more pressing issue is, how do we find the control point once we are inside the fortress, and who will take control of it?\"Both Asher and Raeth leaned forward slightly as Velin finished speaking. How to deal with the fortress once this portion of the quest was over was indeed the piece of information they were most interested in. Chuckling, Thorn look between them. \"I think the only fair thing to do is say that whoever finds it, keeps it. But what are your thoughts?\"\"I agree.\" Raeth's face was hard, a competitive light glistening in his eye as he stared at Thorn aggressively.\"Um.\" Asher was not so sure, glancing back and forth between Thorn's giant frame and the silver armored captain from Ragnarok. \"You can speak freely.\" Thorn patted Asher on the shoulder to encourage him.\"What happens when only one guild can control the fortress? I don't want to fight my way into the fortress only to be kicked out because my guild did not get the control point.\"\"That is reasonable. None of us want to do all the work and get no reward. Captain, what do you think? How can we ensure that each guild gets a slice? How would you feel about an agreement that the guild that gains the control point will allow the other two guilds to proceed to the next step of the quest from here.\"\"That should work.\" After thinking it over for a moment, Raeth agreed, and Thorn sent each of the two other leaders a document.\"Take a look at it. Should be pretty straightforward. Main point covers a non-aggression agreement while we are engaged in the assault on the fortress. Second point covers the fact that no one will contest ownership of the control point with the guild who has it. Third through fifth points outline the agreement once we clear this stage of the quest. First, the owner of the control point guarantees the other two guilds free and clear access to the fortress in whatever capacity is necessary for the completion of the next steps of the World Quest. Second, agrees to give both of the other guilds a fair shake at completing the next stage of the World Quest. And, third, agrees to allow the other two guilds to keep any loot that they've acquired before the control point is captured.\"\"Did you just have this in your back pocket?\" Asher stared at the legally binding document, his confusion plainly written on his face.\"I've got fast lawyers.\" Thorn smirked.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi Everyone!

They will also get the first shot at the second stage, if the second stage of this quest is limited to a single group at a time.\"\"Why would they get to choose first?\" Raeth humphed, displeased that Thorn was making arbitrary decisions.\"Aurum is going to bear the brunt of the Dwarven army's attacks once we are inside the fortress. If you want to replace them, feel free to volunteer. I'm sure they would be happy to switch with you.\"\"Preposterous.\" Raeth shook his head, completely ignoring Asher's furious face. \"That is too significant of an advantage.\"\"It is not negotiable.\" Thorn held up his hand to forestall Raeth's argument. \"If you wish to have the second choice, that's fine, but you must also lead the assault to breach the gate.\"\"You expect me to agree to that?\"\"If you can't agree, you can leave.\"\"Don't think you can just push Ragnarok around.\" Raeth's expression was stormy, his eyes burning with anger.\"No one is trying to push you around, but don't think that you can get the benefit without putting in the work. What if I agree to stay back with the main team? I will not participate in hunting for the control point.\"Considering Thorn's suggestion, Raeth glared at the giant. He wanted to protest, but Thorn was staring him down, a bland smile on his face. \"Fine.\" The captain turned away, waving his hand dismissively. \"Thanks for sticking up for us.\" Watching Raeth walk away, Asher grimaced. \"Ragnarok is used to getting their way, so you should watch your back. They don't like it when they don't get the biggest portion.\"\"No problem. We're allies, so we need to watch out for each other. Besides, they already don't like me. Let's get this started.\"The gloomy underground world stretched out before the Titan squad as Thorn led the way toward the Dwarven fortress. Mina, Velin, Jorge, and Oberlin walked behind him with the rest of the Titan squad, while the Deimos and Phobos squads followed them. To the sides, the Silver Guard of Ragnarok and the Aurum team flanked Nova Luna's force. Altogether, the three guilds boasted nearly 600 players, organized into twelve blocks of fifty. Each block of 50 players was an independent raid team combining tanks, damage dealers, and support characters. Only Ragnarok's block was different, comprised entirely of the Silver Guard, led by Raeth. The scouts reported that the dwarves on the fortress wall would only react when the players approached within 100 feet, so Thorn stopped the army just outside of that range.\"Listen up. Execute just as we planned. This is a fast raid mission, so do everything you can to avoid being surrounded. We do have to wipe out the dwarves, but it will be much easier to do if we can seize the control point first. Each guild has an independent team that will hunt for the control point once we have breached the city, while the other 9 teams will be split up into groups of three. Each group will be responsible for pulling the Dwarven forces apart to make it easier for the three hunting squads to find the control point. Got it? Fighting will be fierce, so make sure you are bringing your A-game. Get everything ready, we will be starting in 5 minutes.\"As the players made their last minute preparations, Mina poked Thorn in the side.\"Isn't this guaranteeing that Ragnarok will get the control point?\"\"What do you mean? Each guild has a team looking for the control point. Everyone has a fair shake at it.\"\"How is it fair? Ragnarok only brought 50 players, so their entire contribution is tied up in their single squad that is looking for the control point. They don't have to spend any effort occupying the Dwarven army and, instead, can rush to find the control point. Plus, our best team has to stay to fight the dwarves.\" Velin joined the conversation, looking up from her notebook where she had been writing down notes about the fortress.\"That is true,\" Thorn admitted, rubbing the back of his head. \"But we have more players, which will make searching for the control point much easier. It should be fairly balanced.\"\"Not if we are surrounded by dwarves.\" Mina muttered under her breath.Grinning at the complaining witch, Thorn fixed his helmet in place and readied his tetsubo. After checking that everyone was ready, Thorn led the army of players right up to the 100 foot mark. Staring at the imposing fortress wall, a tense silence hung over the players. Standing at the very edge of the dwarves' engagement range, Thorn's eyes scanned the wall. Row after row of stone armored dwarves stood as still as statues, their weapons locked at their sides. \"Remember, don't allow yourself to get surrounded. Keep moving at all times, and try to coordinate between teams as much as possible. Raeth, your Silver Guard is taking point. We are relying on you to breach the gate quickly. Asher, you are taking the lead in commanding the rest of the army until we are inside,\" Thorn reminded everyone one last time. After double-checking that the leaders were ready, Thorn turned to Raeth and nodded. The Silver Guard captain raised his hand, and immediately the team from Ragnarok surged forward, heading directly for the open gate.\"Alright, let's keep them covered!\" Asher bellowed, commanding the Nova Luna and Aurum players to move forward. Atop the wall, the rows of stone defenders took a step forward with mechanical precision, raising crossbows and beginning to fire down at the advancing Silver Guard. \"Archers and mages, target the walls. Tanks, shields up. Support, keep the Silver Guard standing. Let's move!\"The 600 players were all elites and moved together. Rushing toward the wall alongside the Silver Guard, the tanks raised their shields, doing their best to protect the silver armored players from the crossbow bolts that had begun to rain down on them. Behind them, the ranged damage dealers began to throw a variety of spells and arrows at the dwarves along the edge of the wall. Arrows arched over the heads of the advancing tanks, smashing into the stone armored dwarves. The spellcasters coordinated with the archers, raining down ice, fire, and numerous other elements on the top of the wall.Rushing forward into the open gate, the Silver Guard raised their shields, doing their best to ward off the stones and arrows that the gate's defenders were raining down on them from the wall above. A large stone tumbled off the parapet onto the path below, coming down directly on top of a Silver Guard's shield. Straining under the impact, the player struggled to push it to the side, finally heaving it off and onto the ground next to him. Gasping for breath, he saw another stone falling toward him. The first stone had dropped his health dangerously, low so it was with relief that he felt the warm glow of a healing spell.Despite the ferocious barrage of bolts and debris, the Silver Guard pushed forward bravely, relying almost entirely on the other two guilds' healers to make progress. As they neared the gate, rows of stone dwarves appeared in the arched entryway. Covered in thick stone armor and wielding stone axes, the Dwarven defenders presented a formidable picture. Undeterred, Raeth gave his commands.\"[Holy Strike] on the center five enemies at my command. Ready? Strike!\"As soon as the words rolled from his lips, the Silver Guard burst into action. The first row of ten players raised their swords and cast [Holy Strike] on a single stone dwarf. Light flashed above the dwarf's head, lancing down like a beam of sunlight. It quickly grew in intensity as the ten [Holy Strike] spells combined together, magnifying the damage and producing a burning effect. At the same moment, the second row of Silver Guard targeted the next dwarf, casting [Holy Strike] together, burying the enemy in blinding light. Each of the five rows of Silver Guard followed suit, causing the fortress gateway to glow white hot for a moment.\"Press!\" Raeth commanded as the bright glow began to fade, and with well-ordered precision, the Silver Guard pushed forward into the gate. \"Strike!\"With each command, the Silver Guard smashed a row of dwarves and then pressed forward, their armor ringing out as they moved in tandem. Watching from behind, it was all Thorn could do to keep his amazement off of his face. Seeing where he was looking, Velin nodded her head.\"Impressive, huh? It isn't for nothing that Ragnarok's Silver Guard have the reputation as the best organized group in the game. But that is what happens when someone gets a quad category class.\"\"And they've been playing together for almost 30 years in-game. Ever since the game started,\" Mina chimed in.\"That is a great point.\" Thorn rubbed his chin as he watched them move through the gate. \"That will be us someday, but even better.\"Nearby, Asher continued to give out commands, organizing the two guilds to cover for the Silver Guard as much as possible. Seeing that the team from Ragnarok had almost pushed the whole way into the fortress gate, Asher signaled for the rest of the army to move forward. Advancing with the army, he soon came to stand next to Thorn.\"Are you sure we can trust Ragnarok to hold the gate while we enter?\"\"Who knows,\" Thorn shrugged. Raeth had appeared quite compliant regarding the plan they had established, but Thorn was not about to forget the animosity the Silver Guard captain had displayed when he first arrived. \"Either way, we should be fine. If they make a break for it, they'll attract the Dwarven army's attention, and if they help us hold the gate, it will be easier for us to get in.\"Thorn! The gate!\"Mina's scream snapped Thorn's attention back to the front of the fortress where he could see the metal teeth of the portcullis starting to lengthen. The Silver Guard were packed into the gate, a bit more than half of them on the inside, about to push into the city. Above them, the large metal gate was starting to drop down.\"Velin, I'm going in!\" Thorn's booming voice brought a slight pause to the battlefield as he exploded into action.\"I'm on it.\" Giving a curt reply, Velin immediately started chanting, golden light beginning to coalesce around Thorn's massive figure as he broke into a sprint. \"[Wolf's Rage]!\"Abruptly, his figure sped up and he bounded forward, covering the last 20 feet in two massive steps.\"Move,\" he growled, the sound of his deep voice sending shockwaves through the Silver Guards standing under the falling portcullis, causing them to stagger to the sides. The massive portcullis began to drop even faster as gravity took hold of the weight. With bars that were five inches in diameter, the metal gate was incredibly heavy, and if it closed, it could take hours to break open.Packed tightly in the gateway, almost thirty of the Silver Guard would be caught on the inside if it closed, trapped and at the mercy of the legions of stone dwarves inside the fortress. With a thunderous rattle, the portcullis fell, picking up speed as it went.Now directly underneath it, Thorn lifted his hands and braced for impact.With a shriek, the rattling sound of the falling portcullis cut off as the mass of iron smashed down on top of Thorn, driving his feet into the ground and sending dust billowing.\"Did he just try to catch that?\" Asher asked Velin, his mouth hanging open in complete disbelief.The War Priestess said nothing, her eyes tightly fixed on the gate. Coughing as they emerged from the cloud of dust, a few of the Silver Guard who had been under the portcullis as it began to fall crawled away. As the dust in the air settled, the red glowing eyes peering from Thorn's helmet were the first part of him to appear. Half crouched like Atlas holding up the world, Thorn's feet were spread apart and his arms were raised. The players watched in absolute awe as the Titan grunted and slowly, inch by inch, began to straighten up.Groaning, the metal portcullis was shoved upward, the metal grinding against the stone walls. With one last heave, Thorn stood up straight, his massive arms raised over his head. Glancing from left to right, Thorn breathed out as he examined the portcullis. He couldn't let it go, or they would be trapped in the fortress, but he couldn't simply stand here and hold it up the whole time either.Adrenaline coursing through his veins, Thorn pushed the portcullis as high as he could and then, taking a quick step backwards, he yanked on it with all his might. With a tremendous shriek, the metal twisted and popped. Stepping back once more, he pulled again, the crunch of crumbling stone adding to the noise.Pausing for a moment, Thorn took a deep breath and adjusted his grip. With a mighty roar, he yanked one last time, bending the metal gate beyond recognition and forcing it out of its grooves. The players looked on wide-eyed as Thorn let go of the gate and stepped away, leaving the grid of twisted metal hanging in mid-air.\"He did not try to catch it. He did catch it.\" Velin's lips curled in a small smile. Mina was not nearly as subtle, whooping and cheering at Thorn's incredible feat of strength. Jorge couldn't help but grin.\"The gate is open, all units charge.\" Thorn's voice once again carried over the battlefield, sending the players into frenzied action. With the Silver Guard leading the way, the three guilds charged forward with renewed vigor, smashing into the ranks of stone dwarves. Even Raeth couldn't help but be fired up after watching Thorn's amazing performance.Inside the gate, the guilds quickly established a perimeter, and the three leaders met in the center. The look in Raeth's eyes when he regarded Thorn had changed to grudging respect, and Asher couldn't seem to stop shaking his head in disbelief.\"Remind me to never get on your bad side,\" Asher joked. Raeth said nothing, but he stood slightly farther away than he hadl.\"From here we will be splitting up.\" As he spoke, Thorn continued to scan the battlefield. \"Raeth, Ragnarok is pretty much on its own, but if you run into trouble, let us know. Asher, since you have the most people here, you will bear the brunt of the Dwarven assault while we are looking for the control point. As we agreed, you will get the first shot at the next stage of this quest, no matter who claims the control point in the end. You can also pick which direction you want your team to go first.\"\"Alright, I will pick straight ahead.\"\"Great.\" Thorn glanced at Ragnarok's team leader. \"Do you want left or right?\"The captain of the Silver Guard took a moment to look around before he answered.\"Right.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Ooof, sorry this came late today.

The fighting had settled into a stable back and forth, so Thorn took his helmet off, allowing Velin to catch his changing expression.\"Do you want me to send out the Deimos squad?\" The Aurum team had gone straight into the heart of the fortress city, while Ragnarok's team had curved right along the fortress wall, leaving the left side of the city for Nova Luna.\"Huh? Oh, yes. You can tell them to move out.\" With Asher having gone to search for the fortress control point, Thorn assumed command of the remaining players. Fixing his helmet back in place, he picked up his tetsubo and walked to the front line. \"Listen up, we need to do as much as possible to keep the dwarves' attention here. Let's go!\"Thorn's last words echoed out through the city. Infused with power from his ability [Rallying Cry], all of the players who heard it found themselves energized, their spirits lifted. Instinctively, their eyes turned to Thorn who, lifting his massive weapon, dove right into the middle of the stone dwarves, sending them flying.With wide sweeping blows he knocked the dwarves back, clearing space around him. Filled with excitement, the players poured into the breach in the stone dwarves' line, hacking away at them with their weapons. Not content with simply crushing piles of dwarves near the gate, Thorn began to advance through the city, smashing apart the stone soldiers as he found them.The fighting was fierce, but, due to their tight coordination, the players had little difficulty beating back the dwarves. Their simple weapons and mechanical movements made them easy targets for the players, and any damage the melee fighters took was quickly healed up by the support classes. Only a threat in large groups, as soon as the dwarves were scattered their formations fell apart, allowing the players to wipe them out.Standing near the center of the group sending out healing spells, Velin frowned. Opening up her map to check out the city, she studied it for a few moments as the team pushed forward. Her frown deepened, and she called Thorn, who was ranging farther ahead.*ding*\"Hey, what's up?\" In the background, Velin could hear Thorn's mace crushing through the stone enemies. \"Something is wrong. This is too easy.\"\"What do you mean too easy?\"\"This fight is too easy.\" Velin's eyes flickered as she continued to study the map, occasionally waving her hand to send out a healing spell. \"With the right team, anyone could easily take this fortress.\"\"Sorry, I am not following. What is the problem?\" Taking a step back to avoid four axes, Thorn lashed out with his claws, shattering one of the dwarves' stone armor and digging deep furrows in the dwarf's stone skin underneath.\"The problem is that World Quests are never this easy. There have been six World Quests since the game launched. Each one marked the beginning of a new part of the game to explore. So far, they have all required the top guilds to work together to unlock each stage.\"\"Okay, but isn't that the case here? I mean, Aurum isn't in the top ten, but they are still pretty good. And we make up the difference.\"\"No, it is not the same. We could have done this on our own.\"Thorn's forehead creased as he mulled over the situation. Backhanding a stone dwarf through the wall of one of the buildings that lined the street, Thorn turned and lashed out with his foot, blasting another stone dwarf into smithereens.\"So, do you think this is a trap? Or maybe we are on the wrong quest?\"\"That is what I'm not sure about,\" Velin responded. \"If it is a trap, I am not sure what the enemy is waiting on. We are already in the city. Maybe they are waiting for us to relax our guard and disperse? It is possible that your theatrics with the gate put a crimp in their plans, too, since they can no longer trap us...That's it. They are waiting for us to move away from the gate!\"\"In that case, let's group up and see if we can force them out.\" Turning, Thorn strode back towards the center of the group, a struggling stone dwarf held casually in one hand. \"Group up!\"The players who had spread out to fight the dwarves that continued to stream towards them from all over the city began to move back towards Thorn. Casually lobbing the stone dwarf he was holding through the second story wall of a nearby building, Thorn led the players back toward the gate.\"We need to gather more attention if we want the enemy to appear,\" Velin said.\"Attention, huh?\" Thorn looked around and then froze. With a low chuckle, Thorn walked toward a two-story building along the side of the road and waved back the players who were standing near it. \"Back up,\" he commanded, rolling his neck around.Pulling in a deep breath, he hefted his tetsubo in his right hand, taking a firm grip with his left. Lashing out, Thorn smashed his tetsubo into the side of the stone building that flanked the street. With a tremendous crash, the wall he attacked caved in, bringing the rest of the building down. Silence reigned for a moment after the echoes of the falling stone faded away. Even the advancing stone dwarves paused.\"Did.. did he just knock over a building?\" One of the players from Aurum asked another.\"Um, yes?\"\"Velin, take charge,\" Thorn ordered. \"I am going to close as many of these side streets as I can.\"\"Got it. All units, retreat towards the gate while maintaining your lines. Ranged attackers, focus on crowd control.\" Barking out commands, Velin began to lead all of the players back toward the entrance to the fortress while Thorn looked over the buildings on either side of the street.The main street that the player army had advanced along was close to 40 feet wide with streets branching off from it every 200 feet. As the players begin to retreat, quickly outdistancing the slow dwarves, Thorn began to go to work, taking down the buildings next to the side streets, doing his best to block off the main thoroughfare.Seeing what he was doing, the stone dwarves surged forward, their axes raised menacingly. Yet Thorn was simply too quick and strong. Smashing into buildings, sending rock and stone tumbling into the streets, he quickly limited the dwarves' angles of attack.\"Velin, how are we looking?\"\"Good. We have reached the gate and have re-established our formation. How is it going on your end?\"\"I have one more side street to close, and then we will only have the two right next to the gate to worry about.\"\"Are we going to close those as well?\"\"I was thinking of leaving them open so that the teams searching for the control point have a way to retreat, but what are your thoughts?\"\"That sounds good. We are far enough back that we won't get pincered if the dwarves approach on all three sides.\"\"Excellent.\" With a loud rumble, the last stone building lapsed into the street. \"I am on my way back.\"\"Good, because I think you got their attention.\" Velin's voice had taken on a slightly higher pitch. \"Hmm?\" Thorn closed the communication window as he jogged up to the player army. The Dwarven forces were marching up the street behind him, their boots sounding in lockstep. With a deep grinding sound, they stopped suddenly.\"The scouts are reporting a new enemy approaching,\" Velin said, tucking a strand of her hair behind her ear as she stepped forward to watch the stone dwarves.\"What do they look like?\"\"Just bigger and more dangerous.\" Pausing long enough to renew a buff that had faded from one of the tanks, Velin sent a short video to Thorn. In the video Thorn could see a large group of dwarves advancing up the main street toward the player army at the gate. Significantly bigger and rougher looking than the ones they had been dealing with, these dwarves had ornate silver and gold armor, each wielding a single double-bladed battle axe. Rather than stone axes like the standard troops, their axes were made of gleaming metal. As they advanced up the street, the tightly packed ranks of dwarves began to part, allowing the larger dwarves to move closer to the player army. Marching in the same lockstep that the rest of the Dwarven army displayed, the larger dwarves had noticeably more animation in their movements. Advancing in ten rows of ten, they moved to the front of the Dwarven army and stopped suddenly, the ringing of their armor lingering in the air.\"Velin, I'm going to test them out.\" The sight of the new enemy made Thorn's blood boil, and it was everything he could do to keep from rushing straight into the middle of their ranks. His desire to battle had been growing slowly with time, and the fight against the rank and file dwarves had done nothing to satiate it. His shining eyes focused on the gleaming armor of the elite dwarves as they reflected the fortress' burning torches, Thorn couldn't help but flex his claws.\"Thorn, at least take a squad with you.\" The coldness in Velin's voice and the feeling of her hand on his arm snapped Thorn's attention back to the present situation. \"This is not the time for you to show off, the situation is too delicate.\" \"Ah, right. Haha, thanks.\" Thorn was thankful that his helmet hid his blushing cheeks. \"Titan squad, advance on me.\" Stepping out to meet this new force, Thorn led his team forward. The tanks flanked Thorn as he broke into a run, [Pack Travel] allowing everyone to keep up with his ground-eating strides. As the players rushed forward, a long horn blast sounded, and the battle axe wielding dwarves began to move as well, slowly picking up speed as they thundered forward.\"[Shadow Dash]!\" Turning into a dark blur, Thorn dashed forward, his weapon spinning. Dodging around the first dwarf in his path, Thorn spun, nailing the second dwarf in the chest with his tetsubo. With a screech of metal, the dwarf's armor warped as he was launched through the air. Landing almost twenty feet away with a crash that knocked five stone dwarves from their feet, the statue twitched briefly and faded into thick yellow lights that rushed into the ground, leaving a deformed suit of armor and a large double-bladed battle axe on the cracked ground.\"[Wolf Lord's Howl]!\"As the stunning effect fell on all the enemies in range, the rest of the Titan squad arrived, the tanks smashing through the front line of dwarves to join up with Thorn. The front ranks of the stone dwarves' line quickly fell into a deadly melee as the tanks and melee classes jumped on the enemy. Blades flashing, they began to carve into the stone dwarves. Mina was especially impressive, using a spell that Thorn had never seen before to slow the stone enemies and turn their bodies brittle, allowing her teammates to smash them apart. *WHUUUUM*As the stone dwarves began to stir from their stunned state, another horn blast sounded, echoing over the fortress. The armored dwarves shivered and a red glow began to bloom in their eyes. Armored gauntlets tightened their grip on the large metal battle axes and the armored dwarves began to push forward aggressively. Speeding up, the dwarves began to lash out with their battle axes with deadly force.The sudden increase in aggression by the armored dwarves caught a couple of the players off guard, allowing attacks to slip past their defenses. A few of the players sustained gashes from the battle axes, and one of the tanks was even knocked to the ground. The stone dwarf that had knocked him over stepped forward to deal a finishing blow when a puff of shadow exploded over his head and a leather boot landed on his face, causing the statue to stagger backward. Landing next to the knocked down player, Jorge grabbed him and pulled him back into the group of players, dropping him next to a female cleric. \"Careful there, bub,\" Jorge growled to the thankful tank, disappearing in another flash of smoke.\"Whew, thanks,\" the tank called after the Shadow Assassin.\"Rage state!\" Delmore called out from his spot in the middle of the group where he was doing his best to heal Thorn. \"We need to retreat!\"\"Yeah, we are not going to be able to sustain this. Can you pull Thorn out?\" Mina slid past the Tigerkin, stopping herself by grabbing his tail. \"He looks like he lost it.\"\"Uh, yeah. He does.\" Delmore stared in amazement as the giant at the front of the team smashed his way through the oncoming ranks of raging dwarves. \"[Spirit Displacement]!\"Something in the back of Thorn's brain was telling him that he was in too deep, but his enjoyment of the fight made him push it down. It was only in the thick of melee fights that Thorn felt like he could fully employ his size and strength to his advantage. Putting away his tetsubo, Thorn began to lash out with kicks and punches, smashing the armored dwarves with abandon. Driving his claws into the chest of one dwarf, Thorn slapped a battle axe away with such force that the metal end broke off, spinning through another statue's arm.Hoisting the first dwarf into the air, Thorn snapped a side kick that sent five dwarves tumbling and then brought the dwarf in his fist down so hard that the flagstones under him cracked. A battle axe blade cut into the armor of his back, sending a sliver of pain lancing through him, but a backhand crushed the armored dwarf's helmet. Counting on his teammates to heal him, Thorn fought with abandon, crushing anything that came into his reach.Fighting with his hands and feet, Thorn could slowly feel his [Unarmed Proficiency] improving. It was a surreal feeling, as if his moves were becoming cleaner as he fought. It was subtle, but he could feel the experience slowly piling up. The idea of improving through combat was intoxicating, and slowly he began to push deeper into the stone dwarves' ranks. Surrounded by the red-eyed, armored dwarves, Thorn was having the time of his life when his vision warped, and he found himself standing behind the Titan squad.\"We need to retreat!\" Mina yelled at Thorn, who still had his fist raised. Glaring at him in annoyance as he slowly dropped his hand, she pointed her wand at the tanks who were struggling against the enraged dwarves. \"You might be able to deal with them in their rage state, but we can't.\"\"Ah, sorry.\" Embarrassed again by his lack of control, Thorn was about to pat Mina on the head but thought better of it. \"Titan squad, fall back!\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Are you interested in reading the rest of Book #3?

Having borne the brunt of the enraged stone dwarves' attacks, the tanks were in rough shape, despite the healing from the support players. Even Thorn had lost a fair amount of health under the onslaught. Rushing back toward the player army fortified at the fortress gate, the Titan squad was barely able to stay in front of the Dwarven horde.\"Mina, can you slow them down?\" Thorn shouted, scooping the small Ice Witch up mid-stride and setting her on his shoulder.\"Eep!\" Shrieking as she was suddenly sent airborne, Mina clamped her pointed hat to her head. \"I can try!\" Twisting her torso to face the armored dwarves hot on the Titan squad's heels, Mina pointed her wand and began to chant. Three glowing blue orbs blossomed above her head, spinning in a slow orbit. \"[Ice Wall], [Ice Wall], [Ice Wall]!\" The three blue orbs shot forward as Mina cast her spell, splashing into the ground. Ice quickly grew from them, shooting up into the air to form thick walls. The three walls blocked most of the street, forcing the enraged stone dwarves into a chokepoint.\"[Avalanche]! [Blizzard]!\" Throwing out her largest spells, Mina sagged, completely drained. \"That is the last bit of juice I can manage, Thorn. I need to rest for a few moments.\" \"It was great.\" Thorn glanced over his shoulder at the red-eyed dwarves struggling through the swirling ball of ice and snow. Seconds later, the ice walls that Mina had erected collapsed into shards, angry stone dwarves cutting them apart with their battle axes. Still, the few seconds that Mina gained allowed the Titan squad to pull ahead of the stone dwarves. \"Velin!\"\"Tanks, get ready to charge! Second line get ready to off-tank. Ranged, CC on my command.\" Snapping out orders, Velin stood in the midst of the player army. As the Titan squad reached the player army, the Elven War Priestess gave the order. \"Crowd control!\" At her words, all of the ranged players released their spells and attacks, peppering the advancing dwarves and slowing them down. \"Advance! Brace!\" Shouting out, the first row of tanks charged forward and planted themselves, meeting the slowed charge of the raging stone dwarves on their shields and armor. The ringing of steel echoed throughout the street as the two forces collided.\"Second line, rotate!\" Velin's voice carried over the battle. Taking a step forward, the second line of tanks switched places with the tanks that were in combat. Shoulder to shoulder, the tanks stood, blocking the raging enemy. After five seconds of frenzied fighting, Velin called out again, and a third line of tanks pushed forward to bear the burden of the combat. Every five to ten seconds the tanks switched, the injured tanks moving to the back to be healed. Despite how quickly the tanks rotated, a few unlucky players were cut down by the stone dwarves' sharp battle axes, sent out of the game before they could be healed.\"It looks like they are starting to slow down,\" Thorn said to Velin, releasing a bolt at an armored dwarf who was about to bring his battle axe down on a tank's head. \"The red in their eyes is beginning to fade. We should push forward once their rage is gone.\"\"Relax. High end raids take time. We are not in a rush, so let's make sure the situation is stable before we advance. Besides, if you look closely, you can see there are captains in there, waiting to counter attack.\" Velin rolled her eyes at the giant beside her. Thorn was a curious mix of confident maturity and impulsive naivety. Because of his size, it was easy for her to forget how young Thorn was. \"You need to remember that not everyone can keep up with you. You are leading other people now, so you can't just think about what you want to do. If we rush in now, those captains could hurt us badly.\"\"Ah. Right.\" Thorn's shoulders slumped. \"You are right. Sometimes I get too caught up in the excitement of the moment.\"\"It's okay. Being excited is not a bad thing. Excitement is helpful for rallying everyone, something you do really well. We just have to make sure it doesn't cause us to make mistakes. Especially since we are responsible for everyone else here. Excitement is no reason to make a bad decision.\"\"And pushing forward into a dangerous enemy before we've stabilized is a bad decision.\"\"Correct. Even if it would be fun.\"\"Makes sense.\" Glancing down at the Elven War Priestess, Thorn nodded. \"Velin, thank you. I really appreciate that you are still taking time to teach me. It means a lot to me.\"\"Ewww. You two are so cringy.\" Mina's voice drifted over from where she was sending freezing blasts toward the armored stone dwarves, having recovered her mana.\"I know. It's gross.\" Jorge appeared next to the Ice Witch. \"Lighten up, huh? This is just a game.\"\"Oh? Do you think we should attack? I don't mind giving you a hand, if you want to get over there quickly.\" Thorn walked toward his two friends, flexing his fingers. Laughing, Mina slid away and Jorge disappeared in a puff of shadow, grinning widely. Watching Thorn's broad back, Velin's lips curled in a small smile.Stepping onto the front line, Thorn pulled out his tetsubo, crushing any stone dwarf that got close to him. The armored dwarves were beginning to slow, the red glow in their eyes growing dimmer by the second. Noticing that they were not taking as much damage, the tanks stayed in their position a bit longer, weathering the last few seconds of the stone dwarves' enraged state. Thorn could see the captains spread out among the raging dwarves, their tasseled helmets sticking up above the crowd.\"First rank, fall back. Second rank, hold! Ranged DPS, fire at will.\"Responding to Velin's command, the tanks in the front row fell back behind the second row, creating some space between the two armies and allowing the healers to restore them to full health. The second rank of tanks held their position as spells and projectiles arched over their heads, impacting among the front ranks of the armored dwarves. As the enraged state faded, the stone dwarves lost a considerable amount of their defenses, and the ranged damage that they had previously shrugged off began to take its toll on their lines.\"Everyone heal up. We will begin our counter-attack in five minutes. Tanks, keep rotating, and watch out for spike damage from the stone captains. Healers, get your mana back up. DPS, keep up the pressure.\" After giving the last command, Velin pulled a mana potion out of her inventory and gulped it down. ***In another part of the fortress, Raeth brought his heel down, crushing the head of a stone dwarf under his foot. The other forty-nine Silver Guard surrounded him in a circle, cutting down any statues that approached. After leaving the main player army to search for the fortress' control point, Raeth had led his forces through the waves of dwarves. After they had traveled halfway around the outer wall, the Silver Guard turned and began advancing on the center of the fortress, stopping in a large open courtyard and establishing a perimeter.\"Zemma, get started,\" Raeth commanded. \"We don't have any time to waste. The boss is waiting.\"\"Yes, sir.\" One of the Silver Guard stepped out of the circle, joining Raeth in the center of the courtyard. A blue tipped wand appeared in his hand and he began to draw a complicated symbol on the cobblestones. Raeth watched him for a moment and then turned to another of the Silver Guard who was holding a large map of the fortress that was divided into a number of sections. Five of the eight sections had been greyed out, leaving three sections in full detail.\"Have you figured out where it is?\"\"No, sir. But I do have it narrowed down.\"\"Find it before the boss gets here.\" Raeth's voice was cold, sending a shiver down the back of everyone who heard him.\"Yes, sir.\" Gulping, the Silver Guard examining the map redoubled his efforts.In the center of the courtyard, the Silver Guard player who had been drawing the symbols on the cobblestones finished and called over four others. Each of the five players took out a black scroll and stood on one of the symbols that had been drawn on the ground. Beginning to chant, the scrolls lit up with a burning blue arcane symbol that matched the symbol they were standing on. As the chant grew in volume, the symbols grew brighter and brighter, until they burst into blue flame, burning themselves into the air in front of each player.The symbols' blue flame licked the air, wisps of flame flying from them to the center of the courtyard where they gathered into a swirling ball. Growing bigger as the arcane words continued to spill from the Silver Guard's lips, the ball of blue fire writhed, beginning to take the shape of a sixth symbol. Around the edge of the courtyard, the Silver Guard continued to cut down any stone dwarves that got close while the spell built up power. *CRACK*With a splitting sound, the symbol, which was now as tall as Raeth, fractured, a large crack running down the center. The crack grew, arcane energy warping the air as it leaked from the center of the symbol. *BANG*Abruptly, the crack became a jagged doorway, flickering in and out of sight as arcane energy swirled above it. Continuing the chant, the five Silver Guard players continued to channel mana into the doorway, helping it stabilize. A few minutes later, the doorway stopped flickering, and Raeth stepped in front of it, bowing.A purple and gold armored figure with a long black cloak stepped out of the doorway, his helmet tucked under his arm, his wavy blonde hair shifting as he turned his head to look around. Nodding to the Silver Guard captain, he strode over to Raeth. Behind him, silver armored figures began marching out of the doorway, two at a time.\"Welcome, my Lord.\"\"How is the situation here?\" Sylith asked, continuing to scan the surrounding buildings.\"We have narrowed down the location of the control point and are ready to move out at your command.\" Raeth saluted again.\"And the other guilds? What are they doing?\"\"Nova Luna and Aurum are occupying the main force of the stone dwarves while we try and find the control point.\"\"Excellent. When everyone has arrived, we'll move out. I want control of this fortress.\"\"Yes, sir.\" Raeth turned and began organizing the Silver Guard players who were marching through the aether gate. Soon the whole plaza was full, and the five players standing on the arcane symbols stopped channeling mana into the blue flames in front of them, causing the aether gate to collapse.\"Sir, I've located the control orb. It is seven blocks away in a tower.\" The Silver Guard player with the map rushed over to show it to Sylith and Raeth. \"There is a straight path if we go over one street.\"\"Excellent. Let's move out,\" Sylith commanded. \"Kill anyone who gets in the way.\"\"For Ragnarok!\"Rushing out of the plaza, the Silver Guard, now 400 strong, cleared a path through the stone dwarves and pushed toward the tower that held the fortress' control point. Behind them, a cloaked figure appeared from the deep shadows. Walking to the center of the plaza, the figure crouched and ran gloved fingers over the remains of the arcane symbols. Glancing at the backs of the Silver Guard, the figure sprang up and followed silently.***At the gate, the player army had just finished resting and was getting ready to push forward when Thorn received a message from Oberlin. Annoyed, Thorn's fists clenched, his gauntlets grinding under the strain of his grip.\"Is something wrong?\" Velin heard the sound and glanced over.\"How sneaky.\" Gritting his teeth, Thorn shared the message with Velin. \"We should have seen that coming.\" Velin sighed. \"I'm sorry, that was an oversight on my part.\"\"What is an aether gate?\"\"It is a teleportation portal that can be set up anywhere. It stays open as long as mana is being channeled into it. Most of the big guilds have one, but I completely forgot about it.\"\"What is done is done. Don't sweat it. What does this mean for us though?\"\"It means we are in trouble. If Sylith brought his whole team, then we're out of luck. Half of his team could probably wipe us out. All 400 of them mean that he will be able to dominate this portion of the quest. Especially if they have a way to find the fortress' control point.\"\"You mean that they will gain control of the fortress?\"\"It is pretty much guaranteed at this point.\" Velin's face was downcast. \"I'm sorry.\"\"Haha, don't worry about it.\" Thorn patted the War Priestess on the shoulder. \"We'll do our best, and we'll deal with the situation as it comes. We are not out of the fight yet.\" \"But we might lose the fortress.\"\"Sure, but we'll just do the best we can. And if we lose this stage, we'll try for the next stage. It's alright, Velin.\"Velin froze for a moment at Thorn's words, her body rigid. With a sigh she relaxed, smiling wryly. \"I guess this is just a game, huh?\"\"Exactly. It is just a game. You win some, you lose some. But we have not lost the fight yet. And until we do, we'll do our best.\" Striding to the front of the army, Thorn stepped out in front of the line of tanks, casually slapping a stone dwarf away. \"Follow me!\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Let me take a moment to brag about my Patreon community.

The fighting was fierce, but once their enraged state faded, the stone dwarves were manageable. Even the armored battle axe wielding dwarves didn't take too long for the players to wear down. Yet, the deeper they pushed, the harder the fight seemed to get.\"Hey boss, something is wrong.\" Jorge appeared on Thorn's shoulder and scratched his bearded chin.\"Do you mean something is wrong besides the fact that Ragnarok is about to get the control point?\" snapped Thorn, driving the butt of his tetsubo into the head of a stone dwarf, causing it to explode into shards.\"Yes. I have a feeling that the last of our worries is the control point.\"\"What do you mean?\"Without saying a word, the Shadow Assassin pointed. Following his finger, Thorn beheld a sight that sent a shiver down his spine. The player army was approaching a large plaza with four giant statues of ancient Dwarven kings. Taking off his helmet, Thorn rubbed his eyes, hoping that he had not seen correctly.But no matter how much he blinked, he could not change the fact that these statues were starting to move. With a loud groan, the closest statue turned its head to look at the invaders. At first the statue moved slowly, but as it moved it began to pick up speed, reminding Thorn of a ton of debris rolling down a hill. With another groan, the statue stepped down from its pedestal, a massive stone foot shattering the cobblestones beneath it and sending tremors through the earth. \"Woooo boy, you were not joking, were you?\"\"Nah, they don't seem like something to joke about.\"By this time, the rest of the player army had spotted the four advancing giant statues and begun to get into position to receive them. Each statue stood 15 feet tall, towering over the players and dwarfing Thorn. The first of the statues was dressed in armor and a two-headed warhammer rested on its shoulder. The second was armed with a battle axe and spiked armor, while the third was armed with a flail, a massive spiked ball dangling from the stone chain. The last statue was dressed in a robe and carried a staff with a golden triangle on the end.\"Form up!\" Thorn's command echoed over the battlefield sending the shocked players into frenzied motion. Just about to charge in to engage the first statue, Thorn paused, his eyes flickering to the elf behind him. \"Velin, you are in charge here. Tell me where to go.\"\"Yes, sir.\" The War Priestess snapped a mock salute before calling out rapid fire orders. \"I want all the tanks in a single group. Tank 1, you'll take warhammer, 2 through 10 you are on rotation with him.11 through 20 on battle axe, 21 through 30 on flail, 31 through 40, pick up staff. 41 through 50 I want you in groups of two helping to control the mobs. Let's get them peeled! Thorn, focus on damage, starting with the staff. DPS, wherever Thorn goes you go.\"As Velin's words rang out, the scrambling players quickly fell into order, tanks locking onto their declared targets and the DPS beginning to rain spells, arrows, and other abilities on the statue with the staff. Thorn smashed aside a few of the remaining armored dwarfs as he charged forward. His charge brought him past the first statue, which tried to squash Thorn with its warhammer, bringing it down with a thunderous crash. The blow shook the ground, threatening to knock players from their feet, but right before the hammer landed, Thorn activated his [Shadow Dash] ability and wove through the statue's legs. Dashing past the battle axe and flail statues, Thorn quickly arrived in front of the massive statue with the staff.\"Hah!\" With a shout, Thorn swung his tetsubo around his head in a great arc, driving the metal weapon deep into the statue's stomach. The sound of cracking stone cut the air as two large chunks of stone fell away from the statue's robe. Slow to react, the statue let out a loud roar of rage, furious that Thorn had actually done damage to it. Lifting its hands, the statue tried to bring the end of its staff down on Thorn's head. Jumping back, Thorn grinned and threw himself forward again, this time swinging at the end of the staff. Seeing his weapon carve a chunk out of the stone staff that the monstrous statue had stuck in the ground, Thorn's grin got even bigger, and he licked his lips in excitement. The tanks had done a good job pulling the other three statues' attention, leaving Thorn and the rest of the player army's DPS to focus on the statue with the staff. Velin stood at the back of the group, giving out directions, her eyes fixed on the statue with the staff. When she had first seen the symbol on the end of the staff, it had reminded her of Karr'Verum, the ancient Dwarven god of healing, which is why she had ordered the DPS to focus on taking down that statue first. Sure enough, as the damage began to pile up, the robed statue took a step back to distance itself from the pesky flies attacking it, and lifted its golden tipped staff into the air. Light began to bloom in the darkness of the subterranean world, wisps of golden arcane energy gathering around the end of the robed statue's staff.\"Thorn! We need to disrupt that spell.\"\"[Wolf Lord's Howl]!\" As the sound waves spread, Thorn could see them reflecting off of the statues, the stunning effect hardly giving any of the statues pause.\"Thorn!\"\"Yeah, I'm on it.\" Gripping his tetsubo tightly, Thorn dashed forward, his steps shaking the ground. The robed statue's head turned slightly to look at him, its glowing eyes fixing on him. Thorn could almost see the gears turning in its head as it tried to decide if it should stop the spell to deal with him. After a little bit of a pause, the robed statue ignored him and continued with its spell.\"That was the wrong choice, big guy,\" Thorn said as he dashed forward. Planting his feet, Thorn twisted his body and threw every ounce of his strength into his blow. The metal tetsubo cut through the air with a vicious hiss, leaving a trail of images in the air. Smashing into the robed statue's left leg, the weapon began to cut through the stone as if it was nothing, carving out a gash almost a foot wide. Feeling his blow starting to slow down, Thorn gritted his teeth and took a small step forward, throwing his whole weight into it. \"[Wolf's Rage].\" A low roar rumbled in Thorn's chest as he activated his ability. Grinding into the statue, the weapon cut through three quarters of the robed statue's leg before it stopped. With herculean effort, Thorn ripped the weapon out, smashing through the rest of the statue's leg and sending it tumbling to the ground. *CRASH*The gathering wisps of golden energy faltered and fizzled out as the statue hit the ground, the fall causing cracks to run through its torso and head. Chips of stone and clouds of dust flew into the air, obscuring the whole fight. Backpedaling to avoid being crushed, the tanks and other melee DPS who had been fighting the robed statue scattered. Peering through the cloud of dust, Velin looked for Thorn's figure. After a moment, she spotted him standing on top of the robed statue's head, his massive spiked mace raised.*WHUUMP*Bringing it down with bone shaking force, Thorn lifted his weapon again and again, pounding into the statue's head until a deep crack began to form. Almost completely caught up in his enraged state, it wasn't until frost began to form over his feet that he realized that both Mina and Velin were yelling at him.\"Thorn, you need to disable the other statues before your rage wears off!\" Velin had nearly shouted herself hoarse trying to get through to Thorn before Mina helped out by casting a slowing spell at Thorn's feet.Responding with a growl, Thorn jumped toward the next closest statue, which was wielding the flail. In mid-air he activated [Shadow Dash], dashing directly toward the statue's chest. As if sensing the new threat, the statue's eyes turned on Thorn like two spotlights. Though they appeared ponderous, the statues were capable of surprising speed. Lifting its flail, the statue sent the spiked ball on the end of the chain flying toward Thorn.His form flickering in and out of the darkness, Thorn slipped past the spiked ball. Still in the air, he reached out and grabbed the chain of the flail, pulling himself forward and kicking out with both feet toward the statue's chest. The force of the impact was enough to stagger the statue, sending it stumbling backwards. Thorn, landing on the ground, took full advantage of the statue's state, smashing into its leg over and over again to keep it from regaining its balance.\"[Ice Field]!\" Sliding up behind Thorn, Mina cast a spell at the ground around the statue's feet. With a crackle, a thick sheet of mirror-smooth ice blanketed the cobblestones. Lashing out with another powerful strike, Thorn forced the statue to step back, and it slid on the ice, crashing to the ground.Rather than smashing the head of the flail-wielding statue like he had done with the robed statue, Thorn sprinted for the next statue. On his way, he checked his rage timer. A little less than two minutes left.***On the other side of the fortress, the Silver Guard surrounded a four-story tower. Gazing up at it, Sylith smiled.\"That map is quite useful.\" Glancing at the Silver Guard player who had activated it, Sylith pulled a token out of his inventory, flipping it into the air. \"Such a contribution should be rewarded. You can retrieve one piece of gear from the guild bank.\"\"Thank you, sir.\" The player caught the token, his hands shaking so much he nearly dropped it. Like most players, he relied heavily on getting better gear to improve, and being allowed to take a piece of gear from Ragnarok's storage would make him the envy of all of his friends.\"What did you say that ability came from?\" Sylith asked Raeth as the player walked away, clutching the token tightly.\"It's a small association called the Drifters. They specialize in finding treasure, sir.\"\"Huh, see if you can find some other people that are part of that association. Quite a useful ability.\" Sylith pulled his helmet from his inventory, buckling it on his head. \"Now, let's get ready to dig out this control point. I want everyone ready to move in two minutes.\"\"Yes, sir!\" Executing a crisp salute, Raeth spun on his heel and walked to a group of Silver Guard who were standing nearby, waiting for orders. \"Let's get to it. Split into groups of ten and spread out. We can't let either of the other two guilds get close until we have the control point. I don't want them anywhere near here, okay?\" Pointing to a couple of the Silver Guard, Raeth called them forward out of the crowd. \"We'll bring five squads to get the control point, everyone else can lock down the area.\"It was obvious from the speed with which the Silver Guard reacted that they had extensive practice doing this sort of thing. 350 of them began to spread out in a large circle, expanding and clearing out stone dwarves as they went. The last fifty Silver Guard formed up in a block in front of the tower where the control point had been located. \"All set to go, sir.\" Raeth saluted, his boots making a slight clink in the silence.\"Well done, as always.\" Sylith smiled as he looked over his team. \"I am always impressed with all of you. There is a reason we are the best. Let's keep it that way.\" Running his hand through his blonde hair, the Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight smiled broadly at the Silver Guard, his pride evident on his face. \"Let's go get the control point.\" With a shout, the Silver Guard rushed into the tower, Sylith leading the way, his gold and purple armor glinting in the flickering torchlight.No sooner had they disappeared into the tower than a slight figure appeared in the now empty plaza. Looking around, Oberlin sent a quick message and dashed into the tower, his form flickering in and out of sight.***Standing in the ruins of the last of the giant statues, Thorn breathed out heavily. The fight had been tough. Tougher than anything they had faced so far. Looking over what remained of the player army, Thorn shook his head. The statues had killed almost one hundred players and nearly depleted the support characters' healing. The losses were mostly tanks who had borne the brunt of the statues' attacks. If there were going to be more fights like this one, Thorn was beginning to wonder if they would be able to succeed in this quest.\"It is not as bad as it looks.\" Velin stood next to Thorn, a golden light coming from her hand as she healed the giant. \"Though, I'll admit that it isn't good, either.\"*ding*Reading a message from Oberlin, Thorn brightened. \"Oberlin found the control point. He is following Sylith and the Silver Guard into the tower where the control point is located. These are the coordinates.\"\"Excellent, let's go.\"With Oberlin's direction, it did not take the player army long to find the Silver Guard. Led by Thorn, they advanced toward the tower that the thief had marked out. When they got close they found the streets blocked off by squads of Silver Guard players.\"Pardon us, but you may not come through here.\" The squad of Silver Guard blocked the street off, preventing Thorn from advancing.\"Are you sure you want to try to stop me?\" The giant asked, his massive metal weapon resting on his shoulder.\"No, sir.\" One of the guards replied seriously. \"But we were given strict instructions not to let anyone pass. I need to ask that you stay where you are and don't advance any farther.\"\"Sorry, no can do.\" \"Listen, moron.\" Another Silver Guard player stepped forward, his acidic tone of voice causing the first Silver Guard player Thorn had been addressing to pale. \"Maybe you are too dumb to understand what we are saying. Ragnarok has claimed this area, which means that you are not allowed to be here. If you don't want a world of trouble, you and your friends better move along.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Did I mention that I launched a store?

At close to nine feet tall, Thorn was not used to being on the receiving end of verbal abuse. Looking like he could squash someone with one hand generally made other people speak to him carefully. In fact, he had never encountered anyone so direct before. Judging from the growing horror on the faces of the Silver Guard around the player who was hurling abuse at Thorn, they were just as shocked.\"He has guts, I'll give him that.\" Mina looked at the Silver Guard player with a deathwish, amusement evident in her voice.\"He is probably one of the players who just arrived.\" Velin shook her head, trying to rationalize why the Silver Guard player would be so glib around Thorn. \"He probably hasn't seen Thorn fight yet.\"Still listening to the Silver Guard player add insult to injury, Thorn removed his helmet and clipped it to his belt, revealing his pleasant looking face. A slight smile hovered on his lips as his warm eyes regarded the Silver Guard player. Cocking his head slightly, Thorn listened with interest. This was certainly a novel experience, so he was not particularly worried about ending it. After a few minutes, the Silver Guard player noticed the odd looks on everyone's faces, and his tirade began to falter. Taking a look at the gentle giant in front of him, he began to notice some details that had previously escaped him.The giant in front of him was wearing battered silver armor that showed the fierce fights he had just gone through. On the giant's shoulder rested a massive spiked weapon that was almost as big as a regular person. Wickedly sharp claws glinted on the ends of massive hands, and suddenly, as the Silver Guard player looked, Thorn's figure began to seem very large in the flickering torchlight.Casually stepping forward, his face still holding the gentle smile, Thorn loomed above the Silver Guard player who had fallen silent.\"Why did you stop? Weren't you just describing what would happen to me if I didn't leave? You don't need to be intimidated by my size. After all, Ragnarok is quite powerful.\"\"I...I'm not...\" Stuttering slightly as Thorn took up more and more of his field of view, the player tried to back up. \"I'm not intimidated.\"\"Oh, good.\" Thorn's gauntleted hand shot out, landing on the Silver Guard's shoulder, locking him in place. \"Too many people are scared of me because of my size. But just because I look imposing, that doesn't mean I'm actually capable, right? After all, there are a lot of large mobs, but you cut them down pretty easily. However, you have a problem, because I don't think Ragnarok is worth spit. It seems that all you know how to do is throw around your name, without any substance to back it up. You threatened me, not with what you are able to do, but based on the weight of your guild's name. How lame.\"Thorn's words caused the Silver Guard player's face to pale with anger. The top ten guilds were considered to be all-powerful entities by most players, and it was rare to hear such blatant disregard. Furious, the Silver Guard pushed Thorn's hand away and grasped his sword.\"Don't think that you can get away with mocking Ragnarok.\" The warrior glared up at Thorn, not cowed by his size. \"We're not afraid of you.\"\"Oh? Easy to say, but it means nothing if you can't back it up.\"\"What is he doing?\" Mina whispered to Velin, her confusion evident. \"Shhh. Just watch.\" The Elven War Priestess put her finger to her lips, her eyes fixed on Thorn, who was looming over the player from Ragnarok.\"Well?\" Thorn's thick finger poked the Ragnarok player's breastplate, the razor sharp claw denting it. \"Are you all talk or are you going to show me how amazing your guild is? Put up or shut up.\"Staggering backward from the force of Thorn's poke, the Silver Guard growled in rage, his knuckles whitening on his sword's handle. With a rasp, he began to draw his weapon when a voice cut through the tension. \"What are you doing?!\" Raeth's voice made the Silver Guard freeze, his sword halfway out of its sheath. The captain approached, glaring at his guild member. \"Nova Luna is currently our ally. What on earth are you thinking trying to attack one of our allies?\"Listening to Raeth berate the Silver Guard, Thorn smiled ruefully. He had been sure that the Silver Guard player would attack him, which would have violated the agreement Nova Luna and Ragnarok had signed and allowed Thorn to go on the offensive. Annoyed by Raeth's interference, Thorn turned and walked back to Velin and Mina, shrugging in the face of their weird looks.\"Eh, it was worth trying.\" Thorn rubbed his nose, smiling innocently. \"Ah, you were baiting him,\" Mina said, realization dawning on her face. \"I was wondering why your whole personality suddenly changed.\"\"I must say, you are trickier than you look.\"Hearing a new voice, Thorn looked up.\"Sylith.\"\"Nice to see you too, big guy.\" The Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight's tone was light, and it was obvious that he was in a good mood. \"It is no wonder that Ouroboros lost to you.\"\"Angdrin lost as well.\"\"Oh, he doesn't count.\" Sylith waived dismissively. \"He only has his position because of his family. He is pretty much useless except as a stumbling block for Ouroboros. Hah, listen to me prattle on. I'm not here to talk about the inner workings of my guild.\"\"Then I assume you found the control point?\"\"That I did.\" With a broad smile, Sylith retrieved a glowing orb from his inventory. \"It was conveniently located on our side of the fortress, so we were able to pick it up.\"\"Interesting. I don't remember you being part of the discussion when we established the agreement.\"\"Raeth signed on behalf of Ragnarok, so I am included in the agreement, obviously.\"\"Sure, but the agreement was that Ragnarok could look for the control point with a team of no more than fifty players. If my count is correct, you have four hundred. According to the agreement, any players outside of the fifty specified are required to help distract the main Dwarven army, under my command. If I felt like being nitpicky, I could say that you violated the agreement.\"\"That seems like a bit of a stretch, doesn't it?\" Sylith's winning smile was beginning to slip.\"No, not a stretch at all, actually. This is further compounded by the fact that multiple members from Ragnarok stopped us from proceeding, even though they were not part of Ragnarok's fifty person team. Technically, if I wanted to nitpick, I could say that the agreement is void since they actively obstructed our alliance's efforts to retrieve the control point.\"\"Hey, Thorn, what's going on? I got your message and hurried...\" Asher, leading fifty players from Aurum, ran over, pausing when he saw Sylith and all the players from Ragnarok. \"Hello. Sylith, right?\"\"Yes. You are?\"\"I'm Asher, guild leader of Aurum.\"\"He is the third party in our agreement that you violated,\" Thorn added, trying to sound helpful.\"I see, pleased to meet you.\" Sylith did not look pleased in the slightest. In fact, his face was quite sour.\"As I was saying, I'm not one to pick apart the tiniest details, but if I was going to do something like that, I would have to argue that you voided the agreement, meaning that the control point is fair game for anyone who wants it. Again, that is what I would do if I was nitpicking every little detail.\" Thorn returned to the previous topic as if there had been no interruption by Asher's fifty player group joining up with the player army standing behind Thorn. \"What are the chances we can win this?\" Asher asked Velin quietly.\"No chance.\" Mina was standing close enough to hear the question. \"Even with Thorn? He's a monster in combat.\"Shaking her head, Velin pointed at Sylith. \"He has a quad category class. He might be able to beat most of us by himself. At the very least, he will tie Thorn up for a few minutes. In a one on one, Thorn might be able to win, but the Silver Guard will cut us apart.\"\"Then what is Thorn doing antagonizing him?\" Asher looked worried.\"Stalling.\"The Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight glared at the calm giant in front of him. The glowing control orb was in his hand, and there was no way he would just give it up without a fight. To completely take control of the fortress, the control orb had to be used in the throne room, but Thorn stood solidly in front of him, without any intention of moving.\"So, are you going to nitpick?\" As annoyed as he was, Sylith was cautious about starting a fight with Thorn. He had seen a recording of the Titan's fight with Ouroboros, and he was not confident that he could do any better than the Exalted Devil Blood Berserker had. The ferocity Thorn showed had sent a shiver down his spine, though he would never admit that to another person. Plus, even if he won, losing men would put him behind the other guilds in completing the quest, which was not acceptable. If he could resolve the situation without a fight, he would.\"That depends. Aurum has dibs on the first shot at the next stage of the quest, but I'm a little worried that you won't honor that agreement. If Angdrin were here, he would say something lame like, 'oh, that doesn't happen because the allied parties didn't get the control point, an independent group that happened to be from Ragnarok got it.' And then I would have to crush him. Again.\"\"I told you, I am not a loser like Angdrin.\" Sylith smiled bleakly. \"Raeth represented Ragnarok when he signed the agreement, therefore he represented me. I will honor the agreement.\"\"Hmmm, okay. I will believe you. I won't nitpick. For now.\" His sharp hearing picking up a faint noise, Thorn raised his eyes, looking over the heads of the Silver Guard.Wondering what he was looking at, Sylith followed his gaze, his eyes going wide in shock as he saw four massive statues bearing down on his forces from the rear. Just like the large statues that Thorn and the player army had fought previously, these statues stood at least fifteen feet tall and held large weapons. Thundering down the street, they chased the group of players from Nova Luna led by the sharp eyed archer Thorn had met during the entry tests.From the corner of his eye, Sylith caught a sly smile on Thorn's face and his stomach plunged.\"Silver Guard to the front. Intercept the enemy. I'll take the staff wielding statue.\" Thorn's voice wasn't loud, but it carried well. Seeing the blank looks, he chuckled and shot a glance at Sylith, whose teeth were clenched. Obviously unwilling, Sylith glared at Thorn and then nodded reluctantly at Raeth whose face was grim.\"Nova Luna is in charge of the player army, obey his instructions. Take on the first three statues,\" Raeth snapped, sending the Silver Guard into action. Rushing forward, the Silver Guard split into eight squads with fifty players in each group. The first group spread out to surround and protect Raeth and Sylith, who were still standing next to Thorn, while each of the other groups moved to engage one of the statues that held melee weapons. \"I'll handle that one,\" Thorn said to Raeth and Sylith, pointing a clawed finger at the statue with the robe and staff. \"Don't worry, I have experience fighting these things. Titan squad, let's go!\"Running forward, his guild mates hurrying after him, Thorn pulled out his tetsubo and launched himself at the robed statue. Slight differences in its form indicated that it was distinct from the last giant Dwarven statue that he had fought in the center of the fortress, but the weapon it wielded looked quite similar. Even the motions were the same as before, but this time when the statue raised its staff, brilliant orange fire gathered around the tip instead of golden light.\"It's a fire mage! Scatter!\" Not waiting to see if anyone heard him, Thorn smashed his weapon into the robed statue's thigh and then jumped away. Moving as fast as he could, Thorn could feel the burning weight of the statue's gaze landing on his back. In a flat out sprint, Thorn realized that he was headed directly for one of the squads of fifty Silver Guard. Yelling for them to get out of the way, Thorn barreled straight through their formation, not slowing down in the slightest as he sent a few of the Silver Guard who were unable to move out of his way tumbling.\"What are you doing?!\" Furious, the Silver Guard stared at Thorn with hatred as he bolted away.\"Incoming,\" Thorn called back casually as a firestorm landed where he had just been. Raging flames licked at his heels as he dove forward, not stopping for a moment. The Silver Guard were not so lucky. The burning spell landed in the middle of the disorganized Silver Guard, sending six of the silver armored warriors out of the game instantly and bowling over countless others. Struggling to their feet, the scattered Silver Guard tried to get back into formation when the giant statue wielding the flail that they had been fighting lashed out, killing another two players and scattering the half formed formation.\"He did that on purpose!\" Watching the robed statue trying to blast Thorn and catching his team instead, Raeth's eyes were burning as fiercely as the spell that had blasted them. \"Swap out.\" Through gritted teeth, Sylith ordered the reserve group of Silver Guard to switch with the unfortunate squad being smacked around by the flail. Throwing a death stare at Mina, who was laughing so hard she could hardly breath, the Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight stalked forward, equipping a kite shield and a lance.The Silver Guard moved with him, rushing to intercept the flail-wielding statue while the disorganized Silver Guard who had been running from it gathered behind them. Smirking to himself, Thorn continued to run, dashing into alleyways and through doorways as the robed statue followed behind, launching fireballs and firestorms with abandon. The spells smashed through the buildings where Thorn took cover, destroying them utterly in explosions of brick and stone.As he ran through the main street, ducking a fireball, Thorn glanced over in time to see Sylith catch a blow on his kite shield. The Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight's actions reminded Thorn of Ouroboros, and when he blocked the large spiked flail without moving, Thorn couldn't help but swallow. No wonder everyone feared him.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Are you interested in reading the rest of Book #3?

It also distracted him, causing him to slow down slightly. As a result, he was a bit too close when a large blast of flame landed on the building he had just run through. The explosion ripped through the stone and mortar, pelting his armor with rocks as the shockwave sent him tumbling head-over-heels.Scrambling to his feet, Thorn laughed out loud and resumed his mad dash as he continued leading the robed statue on a merry chase through the streets. The rampaging statue crushed the remains of the building Thorn had been in with its huge stone feet, crimson energy gathering on the end of its staff as it got ready to launch another spell at its fleeing target.The players fighting against the other statues could see the robed statue's head above the buildings and hear the explosions as it launched attack after attack at Thorn. Sylith was firmly locked in combat with the flail-wielding statue, freeing up the Silver Guard to focus on the other two statues.\"What is he doing?\" growled Sylith, never taking his eyes from the flail-wielding statue that he was fighting.\"It looks like he is kiting it, sir.\"\"[Dragon Stomp]!\" the Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight yelled as he slammed his shield into the ground. A deep purple and gold scale pattern appeared on the ground, creating a tremor that interrupted the statue's attack. The purple and golden scale pattern traveled up the statue's body, creating a link between the statue and Sylith, allowing him to keep its aggro. As the statue was recovering its balance, Sylith called out, \"[Holy Strike]!\"A brilliant flash of light illuminated the dark cavern. A pillar of light shrouded the statue, sending tiny cracks running through its armor. Watching closely, Sylith cursed under his breath. [Holy Strike] had a naturally low damage output, and the raw damage stacking from multiple casters did little against the massive stone statues who were immune to the burning and other secondary effects of the ability. Against most targets, the secondary effects added significant damage, but they were nearly useless here.\"Velin! Why aren't you helping?\" Sylith bellowed at his former guildmate.\"We would love to help you, but we are under strict orders to act as the reserve force,\" Mina replied for her Elven friend, sticking her tongue out at the golden-armored knight's back.\"Mina is right. Thorn said that the remainder of the stone dwarf army is on the way to our location. We are going to have a tough fight on our hands very soon, so it would be helpful if you could do your job and clear out the statues quickly.\" Velin's reply was glacial.\"You...\" The girls' words left Sylith speechless, but before he could come up with a response he heard the tramp of stone feet approaching. The majority of the surrounding buildings were in ruins due to Thorn leading the robed statue on a rampage, but the approaching stone dwarves quickly became visible, climbing clumsily over the broken stone walls.Ignoring the furious Knight, Velin began snapping out orders as she directed the player army to engage the approaching enemy. As the players rushed forward to meet the horde of stone dwarves, the fighting grew thick. Thankfully, despite their numbers, the stone dwarves were not a difficult enemy, and the player army was able to cut them down as fast as they came. \"Jorge, keep an eye out for any of those big dwarves. We have to carefully plan how we engage them,\" Velin commanded, planting her staff and casting a healing spell on an injured tank.\"Fifty of them at two o'clock,\" came the gruff reply.\"It's those armored buggers that rage?\" Asher asked from where he was resting with his fifty man squad. \"Give me a couple more tanks, and we'll hold them off.\"\"Are you sure?\" Velin cast an appraising eye over the ranger, causing him to blush slightly.\"Just watch. We may not be one of the top ten guilds, but we are still professional players.\" Gathering his players, Asher led them forward to engage with the incoming armored dwarves. Watching him go, Velin ordered a group of ten tanks to follow him before her eyes drifted to the robed statue's head peeking over the buildings. Every minute or so, a cloud of dust and flame would shoot into the air, illuminating the cavern for a brief moment. Shaking her head, Velin concentrated on her own fight.Thorn was having a great time, despite having to run for his life. It had been a while since he had felt the thrill of not knowing if he was going to be able to survive. His early days in Nova Terra had been full of that sort of nervousness, but as he grew as a player, he had felt the risk less and less. The spells that the staff-wielding statue was throwing at him were quite dangerous, but Thorn was just fast enough to slip away. Thankfully, the statue was not that fast, so Thorn was able to keep just ahead of it. Every few minutes, the robed statue would cast a giant firestorm, sending a swirling tornado of flame and debris spiraling into the air. Taking advantage of the momentary pause, Thorn would turn and shoot the statue with his arbalest, making sure that its attention was firmly fixed on him, before turning to continue fleeing.Opening up his messenger as he ran, Thorn called Oberlin. The thief picked up the call, his heavy breathing making it obvious that he was currently running as well.\"Did you find him?\"\"Yeah, I did. It looks like Ragnarok used some method to seal him so they could snag the control point.\"\"Then how did you get him out?\"\"Haha, really? I open locks, remember?\"\"Oh, right. That was a stupid question. Where are you?\" Thorn lifted his arms around his head to block some flying bricks as an explosion scorched his heels.\"Running down a street of what looks like banks, heading south. I am approaching an intersection, but I don't know if I'm going to make it. This shorty is scary fast.\" \"I see it. Hang in there as best you can. I am headed in your direction.\" Speeding up, Thorn stopped worrying about keeping the robed statue's aggro. Going all out, Thorn left small craters in the street as the cobblestones pulverized under his boots, each step propelling him forward at a tremendous rate. \"I'll try to meet you at the intersection.\" \"How does he move so quick on such short legs?\" Oberlin squeezed the words out between pants. Chuckling, Thorn spotted the thief running for his life up ahead. Behind him ran a stone dwarf in golden armor carrying a massive hammer. The stone dwarf's ornate armor made it look like a statue cast in gold, from its boots that sent sparks flying each time they impacted the cobblestones to the majestic, full-face helmet. A spiky crown rested atop the stone dwarf's head, marking his status as the leader of the fortress.His eyes lighting up at the sight of the dwarf, Thorn immediately pegged the enemy as Llamrik, the Oathbreaker. This stage of the quest required that they wipe out an incredible number of stone dwarves, along with fifty captains and eight generals. If he was correct, the eight large statues were the generals and the captains had been scattered through the armored dwarves. The last enemy they had to beat was Llamrik, the Oathbreaker, so Thorn asked Oberlin to see if he could find him and lure him over to the player army.Already moving incredibly fast, the giant angled his body and activated his last use of [Wolf's Rage] for the day. Crimson seeped into his vision, and his body shuddered slightly as his speed increased even more. Despite how quickly he was moving, the world slowed to a crawl and every detail jumped into focus. The dim light flickered on the golden dwarf's helmet as his head began to turn toward Thorn. Oberlin glanced over as well, palpable relief on his face. Distracted, the thief stumbled and began to fall forward, his relief turning into dismay.*boom* Thorn's foot landed on the cobblestones, crushing them into powder in slow motion. A small part of his brain couldn't help but laugh at the comical sight Oberlin presented, but the majority of his focus was rapidly weighing options as he approached Llamrik. Numerous calculations flashed through his mind in that moment as he considered how to attack. His target was so short that Thorn was momentarily unsure about the best option. In slow motion, the golden dwarf leader began to lift his large warhammer, getting ready to smash Thorn. Thorn's foot pushed off the ground as he subtly adjusted his stance so he could plant his next step solidly. Winding up, Thorn's foot landed and his other leg lashed out, converting all of his forward momentum into a kick. Expressionless, the golden dwarf did not seem to notice the attack and continued to swing his hammer. In his raging state, Thorn was faster and his metal booted foot connected solidly with Llamrik's chest. *CRACK*Blinking in surprise, Oberlin looked around for the golden dwarf who had been chasing him. One second the enemy had been there, and the next he was gone, a silver giant in his place. One by one, buildings began to collapse in a straight line heading north east. Like dominos, they swayed and then fell, the tumbling brick and stone sending clouds of dust into the air.\"ARRRGHHH!\" A roar of rage echoed through the fortress. Over two blocks away, a golden figure climbed out of the rubble of a building, a pulsing yellow glow surrounding him.\"Shoot,\" Thorn hissed, hopping up and down on one foot. The kick had been textbook, sending Llamrik flying, but the dwarf had been way harder than Thorn had anticipated. Shaking out his throbbing foot, Thorn grabbed Oberlin and began to run straight for the player army. Behind him, the robed statue was joined by a furious golden dwarf, whose short legs were moving so fast they were nothing but a blur. \"Hold on.\" Slinging Oberlin onto his back, Thorn took advantage of the remaining time on his [Wolf's Rage] and made a beeline for the player army, crushing through anything in his way. Cutting a swath of destruction through the city, Thorn and Oberlin made it back to the player army in only a few minutes, the robed statue and Llamrik hot on their heels.The player army had been able to hear the rumbling from where they fought the stone dwarves, and as the sounds grew closer, they began to look worried. Blasting through a building, Thorn landed on the street with the rest of the player army, crushing a few stone dwarves in the process. His rage had begun to fade, and looking around, he took in the scene. Sylith and the Silver Guard had successfully cut down two of the three giant statues with the Titan squad's reluctant help. The players from Aurum and Nova Luna had decimated the armored dwarves under Asher's leadership and begun to clear the remaining stone dwarves.\"Velin, big boss is incoming!\" Thorn shouted to the War Priestess, who was overseeing the whole battle.\"Got it.\" Velin looked over at the Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight. \"Sylith! It is time for you to show us how good you are.\"\"And what have I been doing this whole time?\" Sylith spat angrily. Velin had given the Silver Guard the bare minimum support they needed to deal with the statues, causing the Silver Guard's number to dwindle down from 400 to 283. This was the first time in years that the Silver Guard had lost so many members. Despite his anger over this, there was little the leader from Ragnarok could do because of the agreement that Raeth had signed.\"This enemy is different. Llamrik the Oathbreaker is on the way here. The Silver Guard is responsible for stalling while Nova Luna clears the last two statues and Aurum mops up the rest of the stone dwarves.\" Seeing the hesitation in Sylith's eyes, Velin's already frosty gaze got even colder. \"Of course, if you want to give up the control point orb, Nova Luna wouldn't mind replacing you to deal with the boss.\"\"What?!\" Sylith was clearly taken aback, shooting a glare at Raeth, who looked as confused as he did. Ragnarok had used an incredibly rare and expensive magic scroll to seal the boss so that they could grab the control point without having to beat him. They even had to sacrifice 11 Silver Guard to do it. The plan had been that they would take over the fortress and then make the other guilds fight the boss, yet nothing seemed to be going to plan. Thorn had drawn them into the middle of the fight before they could get to the altar in the center of the fortress, dumping the majority of the burden on them.\"No, we'll do it.\" It took a moment for Sylith to reply, but finally he nodded his head, directing his team to switch with the players from Nova Luna. Taking a moment to rest, Sylith continued to grind his teeth. The massive statues had been hard enough, and now Velin was telling him to deal with the boss? There was no doubt that Ragnarok would face more casualties before the fight was over. Soon Llamrik the Oathbreaker's golden figure appeared, followed closely by the robed statue. While they were waiting, Nova Luna's forces had successfully burned down the few points of health remaining on the battle axe-wielding statue, leaving the robed statue and the golden dwarf.\"Hurry up and kill the robed statue,\" Sylith growled at the War Priestess, who was healing Thorn. \"We'll hold the boss as long as we can, but these stupid statues are almost immune to our damage. If you want to clear this quest, you better play nice.\"\"You want us to play nice?\" Chuckling mirthlessly, Thorn stood up, stretching to his full height and towering over Sylith. \"Who was it that tried to sneak more people in? Who was it that disobeyed orders? You do your job, and we'll do ours.\"\"Alright, both of you have work to do.\" Velin pushed her way between the two men. \"We don't have time to fight. Llamrik is here, so get into position, Sylith. Thorn, I need you to take down the robed statue as fast as possible.\"\"Hmph.\" With a snort, the Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight turned away, equipping his shield and lance. \"Ragnarok, move out!\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Did I mention that my merch store is open?

Thorn snorted even louder than Sylith had and pulled out his tetsubo, swaggering off exaggeratedly as he called for Nova Luna to gather. Asher, watching from the side, had to cover his mouth to keep from laughing. Watching the giant walk off, Asher shook his head. Few players in Nova Terra were crazy enough to directly mock one of the leaders of the third strongest guild in the game, so it was refreshing to watch Thorn's antics.\"Clearing the rest of the Dwarven army shouldn't be an issue. Once you're done, please assist Nova Luna, and then we'll work together to fight the boss.\" Velin tucked an errant strand of hair behind her ear, her eyes scanning the battlefield to make sure everyone was in place.\"Sure thing.\" Asher nodded as he drew his bow. Looking over the remains of the Dwarven army, Asher called his guildmates. \"Let's finish this up.\"\"Alright everyone, this is the last fight, then we'll be able to rest.\" The players' fatigue had not escaped Velin's sharp eyes. With a cheer, the players from Aurum and Nova Luna moved out to engage their targets. By now the players were very familiar with the stone dwarves and had no trouble crushing through them. Even the fight against the massive stone statue went smoothly as the players from Nova Luna piled on it.Ragnarok was the only guild that was having trouble with their task. Luckily, they had already gone up against Llamrik the Oathbreaker in the tower and were at least a little familiar with the boss' abilities. Still, by the time Nova Luna felled the large robed statue, the Silver Guard had lost 17 players to Llamrik's hammer. Every time the warhammer, fell its strength was devastating, and despite their defensive abilities, a direct hit would instantly claim the life of a Silver Guard.\"What are you waiting for?!\" Sylith yelled at Thorn when he saw the Titan watching them fight the boss. Nova Luna had just dropped the robed statue, and the players were catching their breath. Feeling vindictive, the Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight threatened, \"If you don't come and help, we are abandoning the fight.\"\"Relax. We'll help you.\" Calling all of the Nova Luna ranged damage forward, Thorn pointed to the boss as he drew his arbalest. \"You heard him. Cut down the boss as soon as possible.\"\"Yes, sir!\"Spells, arrows, and other attacks began to fall on the golden statue, burying him under a torrent of flame, ice, thunder, and earth. The majority of the attacks simply glanced off of the boss' shining armor, destroying the ground around him. Even though only a sliver of the damage was able to sneak through, the combined attacks still carved a chunk of health off of the boss, sending small cracks through his armor. Llamrik's chestplate already had a large dent from where Thorn had kicked him, and the attacks caused it to grow. Seeing that their attacks were having more of an effect than the Silver Guard's [Holy Strike], the players from Nova Luna redoubled their efforts. It wasn't too long before Aurum had cleaned up their task, as well, and their ranged DPS joined in. Both Nova Luna and Aurum were careful to stay out of the boss' range, leaving the aggro to the Silver Guard, much to Sylith's annoyance.Within half an hour the players finally wore the golden dwarf statue down, leaving him with just a fraction of his health. Just as Thorn was about to release another bolt from his arbalest, he noticed Sylith stepping back. The golden armored knight lifted his lance and shield and yelled out, the tip of his lance pointing at the roof of the cavern. Silver energy gathered at the lance's grip, arcing along its body. *THRUMMM*The body of Sylith's lance began to blur as the silver energy coursed around it, warping the air with its power. With a low shout, the Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight dashed forward, charging directly at the boss.\"[Heavenly Dragon Strike]!\"As he flashed forward, the energy around the lance morphed, transforming into a silver dragon. Sylith's cape spread behind him like giant wings as the dragon's head lunged toward the boss, its toothy maw stretching wide. With a bang, the dragon chomped down on the golden dwarf, immobilizing him for a brief moment. Still charging, Sylith took advantage of the boss' frozen state to send half a dozen stabs into his chest. Each strike pierced into Llamrik's golden breastplate, punching a hole straight through.With one last strike, Sylith planted his weapon deep into the boss' chest and jumped back, his shield up. The golden statue struggled for a moment and then collapsed to the ground, melting into the earth. Exultant at its victory, the silver dragon lifted its head and roared, causing dirt and rocks to dance in the shaking cavern. Sylith strode forward, grasping the handle of his lance and pulling it from the ground amid cheers from the Silver Guard.The players from Aurum and Nova Luna were more subdued, but even they could not suppress the sighs of relief. It had been a long and grueling fight, and everyone was exhausted. *ding* Even Thorn was excited to sit down and rest. Physically he felt fine, but mentally he was drained from having to concentrate for so long. Still, it was not time to relax quite yet. With a glance at Sylith, Thorn gathered Velin, Mina, and Asher.\"Lets go talk to Sylith.\"\"Do you think he will honor the agreement?\" Asher wiped his hands on his leather armor nervously.\"I don't see why he wouldn't.\" Thorn shrugged. \"But we'll have to see.\"The Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight looked up as the group approached, his face twitching. He had invested very heavily in this stage of the quest, and the Silver Guard had lost a significant number of players. In the last fight with Llamrik the Oathbreaker, twenty seven Silver Guard players had fallen, brining Ragnarok's losses up to 144. \"That was an impressive attack.\" Pretending they were friends, Thorn walked up to the leader of Ragnarok and slapped him on the shoulder, nearly knocking him from his feet. \"I really liked the part with the wings. Very cool, very cool.\" Ignoring the glare he got in response, Thorn smiled widely as he looked around the nearly ruined fortress. \"Are you planning to claim the fortress? If you don't want it, Nova Luna would be happy to trade you for it.\"The intense combat against the stone dwarves had left a trail of devastation across the fortress, and, apart from a few buildings around the edge of the walls, few structures were still in one piece. Between Thorn's actions to lock down the main street and the explosive fire spells from the robed statue, countless buildings had been smashed, scattering brick and stone. \"We would be happy to bid for it, as well.\" Fortifying himself, Asher stepped forward. \"Aurum is interested in developing in the underground world.\"\"So, what do you say? Want to avoid the headache of having to put the fortress back in order? It will take a lot of money, you know. And a lot of time. I know you are a busy guy, so why don't you let us handle it for you. I can guarantee that you'll have access to the labyrinth or whatever.\" Thorn's face was earnest, but Sylith couldn't help but feel like the giant was being intentionally annoying.\"Thanks for your offer, but Ragnarok has more than enough resources.\" Spinning on his heel, Sylith called for the Silver Guard to gather and marched toward the center of the fortress, the other guilds trailing behind them. As he walked, his eyes took in the sorry state of the buildings, and he could feel his eye starting to twitch. Everywhere Thorn had kited the robed statue was practically leveled. It was as if a bomb had gone off in the fortress.The Silver Guard had taken over a number of towns and cities over the years and were not afraid of the investment, but this was shaping up to be a whole different beast. In his head, Sylith had started calculating the amount of money he would need in order to get the fortress back into working condition. As he walked through the ruined fortress, the amount continued to jump.Chatting quietly with Velin, Thorn caught the Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight glaring at him. Smiling broadly in response, Thorn made a point of looking around at the destruction that surrounded them.\"Hmph.\" Not bothering to hide his annoyance, Sylith turned his head and continued toward the center of the fortress. It did not take long for him to arrive at the altar where he could activate the control point. Thorn's fingers flexed as he watched Sylith walk up the steps toward the altar. Feeling Mina poke him in the side, Thorn looked down. The Ice Witch had a questioning look on her face. Behind her, Thorn could see the rest of the players from Nova Luna watching the leader of the Silver Guard, their faces grim. For a second, his heart wavered, and Thorn came close to ordering them to attack. Closing his eyes, Thorn pushed the impulse down, firmly squashing the feeling. He had made an agreement, and even though Ragnarok had outmaneuvered them in this stage of the World Quest, that did not mean that they were too far behind.With a click, the control orb landed on the top of the altar, illuminating Sylith with a blue glow. The blue light expanded and turned into a beam that shot through the street to the back of the fortress. Splashing against the back wall of the cavern, the blue glow spread out, revealing a large arched doorway. Slowly the door creaked open.*ding* \"Well, that isn't as bad as I thought it would be,\" Velin remarked, flipping open her notebook and beginning to jot down some notes. \"At least we will not be locked out of the fortress.\"\"True. What is our next step?\"\"Resting. Everyone is exhausted. After that, we need to scout the labyrinth and figure out how we are supposed to find the stone heart. I would guess that the Dwarven earth maps are going to help. We have two of them, but until they are activated, we have no idea if they are complete. Judging by the way these World Quests normally go, the Dwarven earth maps will provide additional benefits.\"\"What do you mean by additional benefits?\"\"The goal is to find this stone heart and destroy it, right? While it is likely that the Dwarven earth maps will help with that in some way, I would guess that they will also reveal something else. An additional treasure or opportunity. Something that will make participating in the quest, even if not being the one to clear it, worthwhile. After all, the game cannot expect everyone to succeed, right?\"\"True.\" Thorn scratched his head. \"I never thought of that. It makes sense to give out some goodies. Alright, let's disband for now. We'll pick back up tomorrow.\"After dismissing the other players, Thorn joined the group heading for the surface. According to the agreement that the three guilds had signed, Aurum had first access to the gate heading to the labyrinth, so Nova Luna planned to meet the next day to begin their exploring. Having cleared the giant centipede on the way down to the fortress, the trip back was quite smooth, and the guild made good time. Initially, Thorn had wanted to set up camp in the fortress underground, but Corvo had asked him to return to deal with some things.Standing on the stairs of the altar, Sylith watched Thorn's big figure disappear into the tunnels, his eyes hard. The Titan had proven to be significantly harder to deal with than he had anticipated. His few encounters with Thorn had not prepared him for how difficult it was to derail the leader of Nova Luna's momentum. \"Raeth, are our people in position?\" \"Yes, sir.\"\"Good. Tell them to begin the plan.\"\"Are you sure that is a wise idea, sir?\" The Silver Guard captain frowned, his forehead wrinkled with worry. \"If we start the plan now, the impact will be limited.\"\"I know.\" Sylith sighed. \"But if we don't stop him, it will just get harder and harder. So we'll crush him out of the gate. If his guild falls apart, he will not have time to develop.\"\"Do you think this is going to work?\"\"Who knows? But if it slows them down, it will be worth it.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Are you interested in reading the rest of Book #3?

Ever since he had taken over the valley, trouble seemed to follow him like a magnet. His ambitions to casually quest with his friends were constantly interrupted as his situation became more and more complicated. When he received the message from Corvo, Thorn could only sigh and begin the journey back to the valley. He had been looking forward to exploring the labyrinth, but after talking over the situation with Velin, it was obvious that he was going to have to miss it for the present. Though he wasn't pleased, Thorn understood that his position would not allow him to be wilful and selfish. After the other players logged out, Thorn took off running, heading toward the valley. His [Pack Travel] ability did not work if he was not in a group, but Thorn's endless stamina allowed him to make up for it. The trip to the mine had only taken him a single night, even with a few stops to allow others to rest. Even without [Pack Travel] Thorn was able to reach the valley in the same time. The quest had finished up around 4 o'clock in the morning, and by the time Thorn set out, the sun had begun to rise. After fighting all night, Thorn was starving, so he ate as he ran. The trip afforded him plenty of time to think, and as he ran through the forests, Thorn could feel his mind clearing. His life before entering the game had never been complicated. He had lived within strict boundaries imposed by his physical condition and his aunt's job. Wealth had afforded him incredible opportunity, but it had also brought with it an unbendable order. Everything he had experienced had been directed by others.The freedom he experienced in Nova Terra had changed him, causing him to grow and mature as he was forced to make his own choices. Yet the number of options open to him was quickly becoming overwhelming. No one was telling him what to do or where to go. There was no one to establish his schedule or create a goal for him.Taking over the valley and creating Nova Luna had seemed like natural things to do, but now that he had established the guild and taken up the position of Baron Greymane, Thorn was at a loss. To make it worse, the number of people relying on him was only growing. He had put little thought into the fact that other players were going to be counting on him when he started down this path, but it was beginning to weigh on him now that he was in the middle of it.On top of that, Thorn was still not sure what he was aiming for. He had entered the game as a way to pass the time while his body was being worked on and had quickly fallen in love with the sense of freedom that Nova Terra afforded him. Yet he had no idea what he wanted for the future. Thorn had a sneaking suspicion that if he did not come up with a goal, the game was going to come up with one for him. That thought put him on edge.It felt like everyone that he encountered had some sort of defined goal, something that they were striving toward, while Thorn felt like he was still just being dragged along by the current. With a million different things vying for his attention, Thorn was feeling overwhelmed. The fight for the underground fortress had been a nice distraction, even if he had lost it to Ragnarok, but as soon as he got out, he could feel all the different issues starting to weigh down on him again.The pressure from the capital was starting to wear on Thorn's nerves, and the thought of having to face an evaluation was disquieting. On top of that, the fact that players were causing trouble magnified his discomfort. But why should he face the game passively, accepting whatever came along? Thorn had fought for everything he had accomplished, and he was not about to let it be washed away.As his distance-eating strides carried him over the hills, Thorn's will became increasingly firm. The extraneous thoughts and concerns that had been weighing on him began to fade away, left in the dust kicked up by his pounding feet. If his experience underground had taught him anything, it was that the active person had the advantage. Rather than passively responding to what was happening around him, Thorn grew determined to take control of his life and future.The day was well advanced when Thorn arrived at the gates of Moon Wolf Citadel. He had only been gone for a few days, but the sight of the bustling gate brought a smile to his face. Waving to the saluting guards, Thorn wove his way past the queued carts full of goods being transported into the valley. Shouting players mixed with the native merchants, creating a lively scene. Heading directly for the fortress, Thorn responded to the greetings from members of Nova Luna that he passed, each smile and wave hardening his resolve. These people were counting on him, and he was not about to let them down. Pushing the double doors open, Thorn strode into the throne room, the sound of his boots bringing silence to the large room.Standing below the throne, Captain Del'har was glaring at the two groups of people who had been complaining loudly just moments before. Behind the Wolfkin captain stood Corvo, his rag cloak wrapped tightly around him. As the door to the throne room opened, everyone's heads turned, their gazes settling on the giant who had just entered.Thorn walked toward the throne, openly examining the two groups of people who had been arguing with Captain Del'har. On the right stood a collection of natives and players dressed in fashionable clothing. From the jewelry adorning their figures, Thorn guessed that they were the merchants that Corvo had mentioned in his message. The group on the left was comprised of seven Wolfkin players with a variety of equipment. No doubt, this was the group of disgruntled players.After looking over the two groups, Thorn walked past them to the raised dias. Nodding to Corvo and Del'har, who were both bowing, Thorn sat in the Wolf Throne, placing his helmet on one of the carved armrests. His eyes flickered as he silently watched the mix of players and natives standing below him.\"Captain, please remove everyone from the throne room and invite the representative from the capital to meet me.\"At Thorn's command, a storm of protests erupted from the players and natives who crowded under the throne. In vain the captain tried to invite them to leave, but from their furious voices, it was obvious that they were not about to cooperate.\"Enough.\" Even though he was not shouting, Thorn's voice was heavy, weighing down on the crowd like a thick blanket. Using some of the tricks he had learned from his classes in the Dawn Court, Thorn silenced the shouts. \"I will hear your complaints in due time. Your issues have been noted, and you will get time to present your cases. This is not the time. Speak to the captain, and he will let you know when it is your turn. Guards!\" Raising his voice, Thorn called in the disciples from the Temple of the Moon that stood outside the throne room. Waving his hand for the guards to escort the crowd out, Thorn paid no more attention to them.\"Welcome back, Lord Greymane. It is wonderful to see you again.\" Corvo saluted Thorn again, bowing slightly with his right hand over his heart.\"Is it? Seems like all sorts of problems cropped up while I was gone. What is that about?\" \"Eh, something about you seems to attract issues. You know what they say about the tallest tree, right? You've risen to prominence in a very short time and, as a result, you've garnered a lot of attention. Unfortunately, that isn't always a good thing. It would seem that the attention you're receiving is mostly of the jealous kind.\"\"It is not my fault I am such an easy target.\" Shrugging, Thorn cracked a smile. \"Can you give me a rundown on what is going on? Try to limit it to things that need immediate attention.\"\"Sure. As I see it, there are four things going on that require your attention. Two are complaints, one is the woman who has arrived from the capital, and the last is the quest you are on. We can deal with them one at a time.\" Taking a moment to organize his thoughts, Corvo rubbed the back of his head.\"First, the players are complaining about the fact that Nova Luna has a nearly complete hold over the Temple of the Moon and the means of advancing as Wolfkin. Most players don't care about it at all because the method we are using is fairly common for natives. The fact that we are players is what is making them complain. They don't think it is fair for other players to have so much control. They are also complaining about how advancement is so closely tied to the Night Walker organization. There are pretty harsh penalties for betraying the group, so once they are in, there is pretty much no going back. This grumbling only started a couple of days ago, but I can tell that something dangerous is growing. I think that the leaders of this complaining group are doing it to solidify their influence among the Wolfkin players. It smells like they are positioning themselves for a coup.\"\"Really? What makes you say that?\"\"It is the way they are acting, like they are bringing this issue up for the sake of righteousness. Any time people are doing something solely for the good of the group, it is suspect.\"\"Interesting. What else do you have?\" Cupping his chin in his palm, Thorn looked at Corvo attentively. The avatar of Huginn was speaking with certainty, and Thorn was inclined to believe him. He knew that disruptive elements would be trying to infiltrate the valley, but this seemed much faster than he expected.\"We haven't confirmed it, but I think that one of the leaders of this group is from Ragnarok. Since you are now in direct competition with Ragnarok over the World Quest, I would watch for them to start actively trying to keep your attention here. Reports of grumbling and rumors have increased this morning, which coincides with you getting ready to enter the next stage of the quest. I know you have dealt with Ouroboros and his trickiness, but honestly, Sylith is a whole different bag of sly.\"He has been sparring with the other top guilds in this game for years, and his reach is significant. I would not be surprised if he was the one instigating everything. This issue is tricky because players don't like being restricted by other players. They are pinning you as a tyrant trying to control everyone who wants to play as a Wolfkin. If you don't deal with this properly, it could get out of control really quickly.\"\"Hmm. Maybe we were hasty in trying to tie everything up,\" Thorn mused.\"I don't think so. Our idea was fundamentally fine. And overall, the players are responding really well. The idea of being part of a racial organization that will support them with cheap goods and intelligence as they adventure is really attractive. Let me be clear here, this could be a really small issue, if dealt with properly. But, if we don't handle it well, it could blow up in our face.\"\"Are people joining already? I assumed it would be a while before anyone was eligible.\"\"There are already close to 10,000 disciples who have graduated into their dual category class. Don't underestimate how intense people can be when playing this game. The Night Walkers Association has around seven thousand players, while the Moon Guardians have grown to twenty-seven hundred. All of the members of Nova Luna who are disciples are part of either the Night Walkers or the Moon Guardians, but there are close to four thousand players who are not affiliated with us that have joined. And more are joining every day as they complete their disciple training.\"\"Impressive. Do we have a way for Wolfkin who are not disciples to join?\"\"It is impressive. Currently we don't have any way for non-disciples to join, which is where the complaints are coming from.\" Corvo smirked. \"Players will complain about anything, but in this case, their complaints are somewhat valid. The instigators are saying that you are not leaving a path for those who don't want to join the temple.\"\"How many people are stirring the pot? Is there any way to isolate them?\"\"We've traced it back to three players. Two of them were here a moment ago, but the third stays behind the scenes. We don't have any way of limiting who spawns as a Wolfkin, and we want to be really careful exerting more control than we need to, or we might actually justify their cause.\"\"That makes sense. Let me think about it for a bit.\" Thorn tapped the armrest of the Wolf Throne with his finger as he considered the situation. Knowing he would not be able to come up with a solution to such a complicated problem in a short time, Thorn turned his attention back to Corvo. \"What else do we have to deal with?\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

Magical lanterns sprang to life as the sunlight faded from the sky, bathing the room in a warm glow.\"Merchants.\" Corvo's face grew dark as he scowled. \"Bunch of parasites. A coalition of merchants has gathered and demanded increased benefits.\"\"Oh? What are they demanding?\"\"They want exclusive access to the valley and a reduction in the taxes they pay. The bloodsuckers are demanding that you drop the tax rate to half a percent or they'll pack up and leave. As you saw, a whole group of them have banded together to put forward these terms.\"\"Do you know what is prompting this?\"\"3C and Silver Fist are two merchant guilds that moved in almost as soon as the citadel was open. They are two of the larger merchant guilds in this duchy and, as far as we can figure, they are the ones pushing this agenda. Silver Fist has great sway among the native merchants, and they've used this tactic before in other places. If we are not mistaken, there is also someone else behind this as well.\"\"Ragnarok?\"\"That is what we think, but we have no conclusive proof. And even if we had conclusive proof, there isn't actually anything we can do. There are no rules against asking for a bigger cut.\" \"What percentage of trade will stop if they go through with their threats?\"\"If all of the merchants involved in the coalition decide to cut off trade, we are looking at a nearly 80 percent reduction in available goods. The game's system will continue to provide the entry level goods, but because this is a starter area, the goods are going to be pretty basic. The merchants also provide a lot of services like appraisal and the raw materials needed for enchanting, alchemy, and other fine crafts.\"\"But what about the cash shop? Back when I bound Akira, I was able to use windowed mode to complete the transaction. Can't people just purchase goods like that?\"\"No, the cash shop doesn't carry any of the goods that merchants stock. So you can buy things like pet cards, or schematics, but you cannot buy weapons, armor, material, you know, physical stuff you use as you play.\"\"Oh, wow. So we really do rely on external merchants.\"\"Correct.\"Rubbing his jaw lightly with his fingers, Thorn sighed. At first blush, this problem seemed easy to resolve, but the more he thought about it, the more complicated it became. If he did not give in to the merchant's demands and they carried through with their threat, the valley stood to lose much more than their business. One of the reasons that so many of the players who chose to play as Wolfkin stuck around was the concentration of services and goods that they could find in Moon Wolf Citadel.If those goods and services were to suddenly be reduced by 80 percent, most players would begin to drift away. Even if Thorn poured money into establishing the service through Nova Luna, it would be too late. Players would naturally gravitate toward locations where it was easier to play, and if the citadel lost the conveniences it currently offered, the number of players in the valley would drop.On top of that, building a merchant network of their own was not as easy as it seemed. If the situation with the merchant guilds soured, they would, no doubt, do their best to prevent Nova Luna from expanding outside the valley, which would make it nearly impossible for Thorn to resolve the issues in the valley in a short amount of time. \"Can we invite other merchant groups to replace them?\" Thorn asked Corvo, \"Yes. That is one possible solution. However, it is likely that we'll have to pay more in order to convince a large enough group to expand here. Even though the merchant groups here are not that powerful overall, they are still too strong locally for it to be easy for any of the bigger groups to enter the market. As they say, even a strong dragon can't repress a local snake.\"\"What do they say?\" Thorn was confused. \"Who says that?\"\"Uh. I don't know. I just heard it somewhere, and I thought it was cool. It means that local advantage trumps external influence.\"\"Huh. I see. I mean, it makes sense. A merchant group in the capital might be bigger, but they don't have the connections that a local group has.\"\"Exactly.\" Corvo grinned. \"At this point, we don't have many options besides negotiating. The largest advantage we have is that the Wolfkin advancement resource is here in the valley. Our biggest disadvantage is that we don't have any other resources to trade. Unless we can come up with some sort of specialty good, we have almost no leverage.\"\"Ugh. What a mess. On the one hand, we have money hungry merchants taking advantage of the fact that we only have the moonstones as a resource, and on the other we have players pushing us to make the moonstones more easily available.\"\"Haha, just wait. It gets better.\" Despite the seriousness of the challenges, Corvo seemed to be enjoying how convoluted the situation was. \"On top of those two things, someone has been dispatched from the capital to assess you and how effective your rule is. Lady Sere. She arrived a few days ago to look around, so there is no way we can hide the fact that the players and merchants are protesting.\"\"Huh, that timing is awfully convenient.\"\"Exactly. I suspect that the two groups are, in part, putting on a show to make it look like you are bad at your job.\"Rubbing the back of his head, Thorn looked up at the vaulted ceiling, his mind running through the laws of the empire that he had read on his trip to the capital. The law was extensive, and if he was remembering correctly, the examination criteria for a noble who was suspected of treason were highly specific. Without direct proof of Thorn betraying the empire, it would be very difficult for anyone to do more than embarrass him. \"If Ragnarok is behind all of this, do you think they could be planning to plant some evidence for the inspector from the capital to find?\" Turning his attention back to Corvo, Thorn tried to think of the worst case scenario.\"Yes,\" the avatar of the All-Seeing Raven responded bluntly. \"I would absolutely expect them to do that. We need to be on our guard. Anything that might link us to the southern continent could turn into evidence that you are betraying the empire.\"\"Alright. Let's tell everyone to be on the lookout for suspicious behavior. I hate being in a passive position, but I honestly don't know how we are supposed to guard against something like this.\"\"It is certainly tricky. Keeping an eye out will be a good start. If I can make a recommendation, I would also suggest that you be as forthright as possible with the inspector. The more she sees up front, the harder it will be for any planted evidence to be effective. The other thing that we can do to help is to lock down important locations. This will not help much if there are spies inside Nova Luna, but it should help against random players. The most important locations are the two offices, as that is where we keep all our paperwork and the details for our information network.\"\"Do you think that the inspector is trying to gauge how powerful we are?\"\"Of course she is. There are a few different things going on here beyond checking if you are a traitor. That is just an excuse so that she can look around. Thorn, you have to understand that you are a major threat, and not just to the players. As the first player to become a noble, you have access to the laws of the empire in a way that others don't. You have protections and rights that no one else has. On the other hand, when the natives look at you, they see an immortal traveler who now has the legal right to gather an army of other immortals. Who in their right mind would want an enemy with an immortal army? Imagine what will happen if you start contesting for power? \"Sure, they might be able to stop you the first couple times, but can they stop you forever? The only way they can do anything to you is to try and strip you of your power politically. Which is why the inspector is here. The four dukes and the interior minister are all looking for leverage. They are all looking for ways to control you and prevent you from gaining more power politically.\"\"That is why they stalled my use of the [Nobility Upgrade Token], right? They are concerned that the higher my noble rank, the less controllable I will be.\"\"Exactly.\" Hearing a knock on the door, Corvo turned to look. \"That will be the inspector from the capital. Remember, she is looking for weakness, but she is not necessarily your enemy.\"\"So complicated,\" Thorn muttered, his eyes fixed on the entrance to the throne room.Captain Del'har opened the door, stepping aside as a tall woman swept into the throne room followed by two guards and a maid. A floor length dress in brilliant green swept behind her as she walked confidently forward, long sleeves covered with crimson embroidery floating elegantly by her side. Thorn looked her over carefully, trying to gain a clue about the upcoming conversation from her face. Stopping around ten feet away from the steps leading up to the Wolf Throne, she smiled coldly, her blue eyes glittering.\"Greetings, Baron Greymane.\" Thorn's sharp ears caught the faint disdain in her voice when she said his title. \"I am Lady Esmeria Gavlof Sere. I have been dispatched by the empire to assess your capabilities and the capabilities of your people.\"\"Hello, Lady Sere. I am Baron Greymane. You may call me Thorn.\"\"Hmph.\" This time the disdain was not nearly as faint. \"Baron Greymane, you have been accused of crimes against the empire. The charges being brought against you are three-fold. First, you are condemned for insurrection. As per the Imperial Law, anyone who claims sovereign control of any land within the bounds of the empire is guilty of denying the rule of the Emperor and rebelling. Second, you are accused of owning resources outside your station. As a Baron and the leader of a native race, you are eligible to control five points worth of resources. You have exceeded that, making you guilty of rebellion.\"Last, you are being accused of conspiring with devils as a greater devil was witnessed directly outside the valley, and you were seen talking cordially with the greater devil on multiple occasions. These three charges have brought me here today to examine you and this valley. After my examination is done, I will be reporting back to the appropriate authorities so that your case can be judged. At that time, you will be required to attend the hearing. While I am present you are required to both answer my questions and voluntarily show me anything that might be of value to the investigation.\"Let me be clear, Baron. You are to heed my command while I am present if you wish for a favorable outcome to this case. Much rests on my report, and if you want to escape censure, you must not hide anything from me.\" Lady Sere sniffed as she looked around her. \"If there is any sign of resistance, you can be sure that my report will be most thorough.\"Thorn's face held a pleasant smile at the beginning of Lady Sere's short speech, but as it progressed, it faded. By the time she had finished speaking his eyes were cold, and the smile was nowhere to be seen. For a moment, he simply looked at her, giving no indication as to what he was thinking. At the side of the room Captain Del'har had gripped his sword, ready to draw it at Lady Sere's disrespect only for Corvo to stop him.\"Captain, please show Lady Sere out of Moon Wolf Citadel.\" Thorn's voice sounded calm but everyone in the room could feel the anger rumbling under the surface. Saluting, the Wolfkin captain stepped forward to escort the noble out of the room. \"Baron, what is the meaning of this?\" Lady Sere asked stiffly, taken aback by Thorn's abrupt words.\"The meaning of this is simple.\" Thorn leaned back in his chair lazily, cupping his cheek with a large hand. \"You are not welcome here. You can go back where you came from, and I will wait for someone from the courts who affords me the respect I am due as a baron of the empire.\"\"A small, little baron like you would dare deny the court's appointed inspector?!\" Grasping at the edge of her sleeves, Lady Sere glared at the indolent giant. \"First, I am anything but small. Second, you are standing on my land, and as per the laws of the empire, I am well within my rights to have you thrown off if you don't grant me the respect I deserve. Captain?\"About to open her mouth to retort, Lady Sere hastily stepped back when a seven-and-a-half foot Wolfkin in smooth black armor appeared in front of her, his scarred face glaring down at her.\"My lady, please come this way.\" Captain Del'har gestured to the door behind her.Unable to believe that she was about to be thrown out, Lady Sere glanced back at her escort, the worry in her eyes evident. She had been tasked with coming to evaluate the empire's newest noble and yet she was being stifled right out of the gate. \"What right do you have to ask me to leave, Baron Greymane?\" The sight of her entourage seemed to strengthen her resolve.\"Are you joking with me, Lady Sere?\" Thorn had not moved from his lounging position. \"I am a landed noble of the empire, and you are on my land. Even if one of the princes of the empire were to be standing here, I could tell him to leave. You are only an inspector.\"At the side of the room, Corvo was watching everyone, his eyes bright. He had only known Thorn for a short time, but the Titan's commanding presence never failed to impress him. At times, talking to Thorn was like talking to a young teenager, but when he got serious, his words carried an invisible pressure that made him hard to refute. It was in moments like this that Thorn demonstrated why he had been chosen as the avatar of Hati.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

Night had fallen outside the citadel, and the moon was visible over the mountains, its silver glow casting shadows in the forested valley. Despite the blazing magical lights that chased the shadows from the throne room, Thorn's words seemed to usher in the cold night air, chilling everyone in the room. \"This is blatant rebellion!\" Lady Sere hissed, her eyes shooting daggers at the Titan lounging on the Wolf Throne.\"No, this is me exercising my rights,\" came the lazy reply.\"You!\"Holding up his hand to stop the irate noble lady, Thorn's eyes flickered as he looked around the room. An interesting private message from Corvo had confirmed his suspicion and caused him to change the way he had planned on dealing with the inspector.\"Enough of this farce. If you are not willing to talk to me, then I have no choice but to throw you out. And believe me, I will.\" Thorn sat up as he spoke, his face growing harder with each word.\"Baron Greymane! If you think you can...\" As Lady Sere was sputtering with rage, a small hand landed on her arm from behind, causing her to quiet instantly. Her face becoming neutral, she stepped to the side, sweeping her gown out of the way to make room for the figure standing behind her. Unassuming and slightly drab at first glance, the maid who had followed Lady Sere into the throne room looked solemnly at Thorn.\"Greetings, Baron Greymane.\" Her voice soft, the maid gave a small curtsy. \"I am Esmeria Sere, the imperial investigator. I apologize for the deception.\"\"Welcome, Lady Sere.\" The gentle smile had reappeared on Thorn's face as the maid spoke, as if the previous tense conversation had never taken place. \"We are going to be eating shortly, would you do me the honor of joining me for dinner? It will be the best chance to introduce you to some of my subordinates who will be helping you while you are staying with us. I'll have the captain escort you to your chambers, as I'm sure you will want to change.\"\"Lady Sere, if you would follow me.\" Captain Del'har spoke smoothly, gesturing to the door as he began to escort the group out.\"Thank you, Baron.\" After curtsying again, Lady Sere followed the captain out of the throne room, the subdued noble lady and her two guards walking behind her. As they left, one of the guards threw a hard glance at Thorn, who pretended not to see.\"That ability is pretty useful.\" Thorn turned his attention to the avatar of Huginn after the door closed. Corvo had used his ability on the finely dressed noble lady after she entered, revealing that she was not who she claimed. Alerting Thorn to this fact, it did not take long to discern what was going on.\"It is.\" Corvo was looking at Thorn strangely, causing Thorn to raise his eyebrows in question. \"What made you so confident that you could talk to her that way? Even if you knew that she was pretending, shouldn't you have been more cautious?\"\"No, there was no danger.\" Thorn shook his head. \"The rules of the empire are quite strict, and some of the strictest deal with how a noble should be treated on their own land. Respect has to be given, even by superior ranks. When the fake Lady Sere entered, she did not greet me with the proper etiquette, which made me question what was going on. Your message confirmed that she was a fake, which means that it doesn't matter if I throw her out. In fact, if the real Lady Sere had not stepped forward, I could have put all of them in jail. A baron is at the bottom of the noble ranks, but the position of any landed noble is much more powerful than a lord or lady.\"\"How are you going to treat her now that she tried to trick you?\" \"Eh, we'll probably just pretend it didn't happen.\" Chuckling, Thorn waved his hand. \"I saw my aunt do this sort of thing all the time. I won the first round by picking up on the deception and forcing a confrontation. But if I make a big deal about it, I'll lose the next round. It's sort of stupid, but that's just how it works. Anyway, let's head down to dinner.\"Forty minutes later, Thorn and Corvo were waiting in one of the dining rooms discussing the merchant issue when the captain showed Lady Sere into the room. The inspector had changed out of her maid uniform into a light green empire waist gown with short, puffed sleeves. A thin circlet glittering with emeralds graced her brown curls, matching the pendant hanging on her neck.Rising to his feet as she entered, Thorn matched her curtsy with a slight bow, his hand on his chest. For a moment both nobles looked at each other without speaking. Thorn had changed into one of the outfits that his Aunt had forced on him in the capital, and if it was not for his size, Lady Sere could imagine that she was facing a dandy on the cutting edge of fashion. \"Thank you, Baron Greymane.\" Lady Sere took her place at the large dining table as servants began to stream into the room carrying dishes. \"It is my pleasure, Lady Sere.\" Thorn smiled broadly. Sitting at the head of the table, he gestured to Corvo, who was just about to take his seat. \"I don't think I have introduced my advisor. This is Corvo. Corvo, Lady Sere.\"\"Pleased to meet you, Lady Sere.\" Hurriedly rising back to his feet, Corvo gave a half bow, getting a nod in return.\"My apologies for the deception earlier, Baron. Your ability to observe is part of what I am here to examine. Tell me, how did you know that Jane was not me?\"\"I told you, you can call me Thorn. All this baron this and baron that gets old.\"\"Very well, Thorn. You may call me Esmeria, or Esme.\"\"Thank you, Esme, I feel like it's more friendly, you know? But you asked a question about how I knew that you were not your maid. Her name is Jane, right? At first it was a suspicion really. But as the conversation progressed it became obvious that, Jane was it? It became obvious that Jane was trying to antagonize me, which furthered my suspicion.\"\"I see.\" Pointing to four of the dishes, Lady Sere watched as one of the footmen served her before turning her gentle gaze back on Thorn, who was emptying a whole dish onto his plate. \"But were you not afraid that antagonizing the inspector would give you a bad report? After all, much rests on this assessment.\"\"I don't mean any disrespect, Esme, but I have read the laws.\" Thorn paused between bites to stare confidently into her brown eyes. \"Your report is certainly influential, but if you were to make false claims, I can appeal the report and petition to have your family removed from the noble ranks. I highly doubt that an inspector as fair and intelligent as you would produce a false report even if you were interested in being antagonistic.\"Watching in fascination as Thorn resumed eating, Lady Sere almost forgot to respond. The Titan had cleared half of the dish he was eating in just a few bites, and from the servants still streaming into the room, it was obvious that he planned to continue eating for a while. Corvo, who was sitting on Thorn's left, put his fork down to take a drink. Wiping his mouth with a napkin, Thorn looked at Lady Sere with interest.\"If you don't mind me asking, Lady Sere, I wonder how you got selected to be an inspector. From what I understand, most inspectors are slightly more... militant. You don't strike me as a particularly martial individual.\"\"My mother requested that I be given this case.\" Esme's voice was still soft and calm. \"She assumed that the danger would be quite low, so it would be appropriate for me to come.\"\"Are the requirements for being an inspector difficult to fulfill?\" Thorn had moved on to the next dish, sliding a whole roast chicken onto his plate. Carefully removing one of the breasts, Thorn cut it in half and ate it in two bites. \"Not particularly. There are some tests to pass, but the most important thing is who you know.\" Listening carefully, Thorn could faintly detect bitter undertones in Esme's voice. \"My mother is well connected, which is why I got this case.\"\"Well, I'm pleased that you are here.\" Thorn pushed the bones of the chicken he had just devoured to the side where they were whisked away by one of the servers. Pulling a quiche toward himself, he looked at Esme, his face serious. \"Accusations of treason should be treated seriously. I have had enough of my name being smeared, so I am excited for you to examine my rule here. Though it has been short, my loyalty to the empire is self-evident, and I am confident that you will be able to see that. But enough about such heavy topics, why don't you tell me a bit about yourself. Where is your family from?\"As the meal progressed, Thorn maintained light conversion, all the while sustaining a steady supply of food from the table to his mouth. Somehow, he managed to squeeze in huge bites as he talked, never once speaking with his mouth full. In the time Esme and Corvo had picked at four courses, Thorn had polished off enough food to feed a small army. An entire walnut and strawberry salad, two and a half quiches, almost half a gallon of soup, four loaves of bread, a small tub of garlic cream penne and at least three whole roast chickens disappeared down his throat under Esme's astonished gaze. Setting his plate to the side to be cleared, Thorn smiled and signaled to a server, who quietly left the room.\"Let's talk about what you need to see while you are here, but before that, would you like some wine? We have sherry, muscat, port, madeira? There are also a variety of sparkling wines, chilled and unchilled.\"\"I'll take a bit of port, thank you.\"\"Of course. Regular? I also have pear, apple, pomegranate, or grape?\"\"I'll try the pear, please.\"Walking over to the buffet, Thorn poured a glass of pear port and grabbed a bottle of Malbec and two extra glasses. Passing the port to Esme, he poured some of the red wine for Corvo and himself. Thorn lifted his glass.\"A toast to you, Lady Sere. May you find yourself always seeing clearly.\" Taking a sip of her drink, Esme heard the door open and glanced over in time to see ten servants enter carrying a variety of desserts. Pies and cakes, custards, truffles, pastries, chocolate fondue, fruit, and six different types of jellied candies soon covered the table. Already quite full from the multi-course meal they had just eaten, Esme watched in horror as Thorn ate an entire pie in six bites. Brushing the crumbs from his fingers, Thorn smiled at the stunned noblewoman.\"We have quite a bit going on at the moment, so I don't know how available I will be to show you around. If you are able to let me know what you want to see, I'd be happy to assign someone to help you.\"\"Thank you, Thorn.\" Selecting a candied fruit, Esme smiled gently. \"I will need to spend some time simply observing your daily activities. Otherwise, a simple tour of the valley and Moon Wolf Citadel would suffice. Per my instructions, you are welcome to bar me from any location, but I will be obligated to make a note of it.\"\"No problem at all.\" Thorn finished emptying a large bowl of pudding onto his plate and placed it to the side, wiping his fingers on his napkin. \"You are welcome to go anywhere in the valley or fortress with the exception of Corvo and Velin's offices. If you want to visit anyone's private quarters, just ask them first.\"\"I know Sir Corvo.\" Nodding to the avatar of Huginn, Esme turned back to Thorn. \"I don't think I've met Velin.\"\"She is one of my officers and the vice leader of Nova Luna. I'm sure you'll meet her soon. In the meantime, feel free to go anywhere else. I'll have Captain Del'har escort you.\"\"That will not be necessary.\" Esme shook her head, her brown curls bouncing. \"If I need assistance I will ask, otherwise, you can just pretend I am not here.\"\"If that is what you would like. Now, tell me. What is the point of all of this?\"\"Excuse me?\"\"Why send you all the way out here for charges that will ultimately be dismissed? If your maid was correct, the three charges are insurrection, owning resources outside my station, and conspiring with devils. All three are bogus and don't stand up to even the slightest scrutiny. First, I never claimed ownership of this land before being made a noble. As this is the ancestral land of my people, the Wolfkin, we lived and built here, but we never claimed sovereignty over it. \"Second, Moon Wolf Citadel was and always has been the property of Nova Luna. I am currently occupying it with the agreement of the guild. Finally, while I did crush a greater devil outside the walls of the fortress, even a cursory examination will show that we were enemies. This just all seems like a colossal waste of time. In fact, it feels like there are a number of people who are trying to make an enemy of me.\"Don't get me wrong, I understand that there is a certain order and balance to things, and I disrupt that balance. I certainly am not taking the normal approach and that, understandably, ruffles feathers. But unless there is a gross breach of Imperial Law, I will be cleared of these charges, and I will advance in rank. It seems that there is little to gain for anyone who is opposing me.\"A slight frown formed on Esme's face as she thought through what Thorn had said. The calm giant had been marked as an easy target from the beginning, but the way he had played the system in the capital had proved him anything but. Now that Esme was seeing him in his home environment, it was even more obvious that he was not easily squeezed. As the conversations ranged far and wide over dinner, Esme had tried to take control of the conversation only to find Thorn gently yet firmly taking the initiative back. Now, seeing his calm smile as he asked his questions, Esme could feel herself beginning to panic.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

Seeing Lady Sere looking down at her wine glass, a slight wrinkle gracing her brows, Thorn put down his fork and waved his hand.\"Of course, if you cannot answer, don't worry about it. I understand that it was not the most polite of questions. You have your own difficulties, no doubt. Truthfully, I prefer to be as forthright as possible, as it saves a lot of time, but I understand if you can't say.\"\"No.\" Esme bit her lip hesitantly. \"That is not it.\" Who knows if it was the wine or the friendly atmosphere or Thorn's soft brown eyes that seemed so trustworthy, but Esme suddenly felt a rush of emotion, prompting her to speak. \"This really doesn't have a whole lot to do with you. The charges being brought against you are spurious and everyone knows it. A certain guild asked for a favor, which is part of the reason I am here.\"\"Part of the reason?\" Thorn's eyebrows rose in surprise. \"I understand that you coming to the valley to do an investigation will slow the process down so it will take longer for the charges to clear, but what other reason could there be?\"Realizing that she had already said too much, Lady Sere blushed slightly and lowered her head, avoiding Thorn's eyes guiltily. Seeing her response, Thorn leaned back and poured himself some more wine. Smiling gently, he quickly changed the subject, offering more port, which Lady Sere took gladly. A few minutes later, as Thorn was polishing off the last few deserts on the table, the door opened, and Captain Del'har hurried in, his face grim.\"Is something the matter, Captain?\" Thorn wiped his fingers off on his napkin.\"Yes, my Lord. A group of travelers have blocked the gate into the valley. They are refusing to let wagons through.\" \"Oh? Is it the same group that was petitioning earlier?\"Lady Sere looked on with interest as the Wolfkin captain nodded his head.\"They have gathered a sizable crowd of Wolfkin and have built barricades that are preventing any traffic from moving. They are refusing to leave until you meet with them.\"\"Is that so?\" Thorn's eyebrows rose. \"And tell me, how did they build the barricades under the watch of the citadel's guards?\"\"I am not sure, my Lord.\" Captain Del'har knelt, his face stiff. \"I am still investigating that, sir.\"\"No matter.\" Thorn did not want to embarrass the captain any further, so he lifted him to his feet. \"Shall we go see what they want? Esme, if you are interested in seeing how I govern, you are welcome to come. Corvo, can you please gather information on all those who are present?\"\"Got it.\" Corvo nodded and jumped into the air, turning into a jet-black raven that flew out of the window, disappearing into the night.Thorn followed Captain Del'har toward the gate at the back of the citadel that led into the valley. A long line of carts carrying goods were tightly-packed in the courtyard waiting for the road to clear. Weaving their way through the crowd, Thorn and the captain soon arrived at the gate, followed closely by Lady Sere.Around one hundred yards from the gate stood three large barricades. Rows of earth spikes grew from the ground with thick, thorny vines twisted between them. Almost six feet tall, the constructs completely blocked the path into the valley. Around the obstruction was a large crowd of Wolfkin players in a variety of types of armor. Looking over them closely, Thorn did not see any disciples. In the front of the group, Thorn spotted a few of the faces he had seen in the throne room earlier that day.\"It looks like you have quite the problem, Baron.\" Lady Sere watched the milling crowd from Thorn's side. The Titan just smiled and walked towards the barricade. Snapping out an order, Captain Del'har led a squad of disciples behind Thorn.As they got closer, a few of the players noticed them and shouted out to alert the others. Clutching their weapons, the Wolfkin players stared cautiously at the approaching soldiers. Many of the players had never seen Thorn before, and their gazes were filled with curiosity as they watched a giant dressed in the latest fashion approach. Stopping when he was about 25 feet away, Thorn looked over the crowd.\"Who is in charge here?\"After a brief moment of silence, one of the players that Thorn had seen in the throne room stepped forward.\"No one is in charge, but I can speak for the group.\" The player was dressed in leather and chainmail and carried a double headed axe on his back. A thick tuft of red hair rose from his head like a mohawk, continuing down his neck where he had braided it.\"Great. Hopefully you can tell me why you have blocked my road.\"\"Your road?\" The Wolfkin players behind Mohawk began to laugh, mocking Thorn. \"Yes. My road.\" Thorn's voice was heavy, causing the players who were laughing to stop. One by one they began to step back as Thorn's eyes raked over them.\"Who are you?\" Mohawk's tone was cautious.\"I am Baron Greymane, of course. This is my road. And you are currently blocking it. You have thirty seconds to tell me why you were foolish enough to erect these barriers before I command the guards to destroy the barricades and you along with them.\"Seeing the guards behind Thorn readying their weapons, the players began to murmur to each other nervously. In the wild, mobs and natives were rarely a threat to players unless they were encountered in overwhelming numbers. In cities and towns, however, natives became very dangerous. In order to allow the guards to keep order, the game boosted their strength and abilities so long as they were operating within the bounds of their town. Even though there were only thirty guards facing them, the one hundred Wolfkin players were rightly nervous. If Thorn was truly able to command the guards, they had no hope of winning the coming fight. On top of that, if they began to fight with the guards, they would be attacked whenever they encountered a guard in this region. Currently, their spawn points were bound to the valley, meaning that if they died, they would simply spawn back in Greymane Village.\"Wait, wait. We can talk about this.\" A skinny Wolfkin rushed out of the crowd waving his hands.\"Twenty-eight seconds.\"\"You can't defeat us!\" Mohawk shouted. \"Even if you beat us this time, we'll be back. You are being a tyrant.\"\"Twenty-five seconds.\"\"Hey, chill out. Do you want to get us killed?\" The skinny Wolfkin hissed at Mohawk, pushing him back into the crowd. \"Baron Greymane, we only wanted to get your attention. We did not mean to cause any damage.\"\"I believe you were told that you would be granted a chance to voice your concerns. Nineteen.\"\"That is just an excuse! We know you are just pushing us off!\" Mohawk was still trying to rile up the crowd, but the sight of the guards taking a step forward instantly dampened their enthusiasm.\"Sixteen seconds.\" Thorn's voice and expression were even but with every count, the guards took a step forward, closing the distance. The closer the guards came to the crowd, the more the Wolfkin players panicked. No one wanted to die, especially since they would simply respawn in the valley and be attacked again. The alternative of being arrested was almost worse as it would force them into weeks in prison. Besides, even if they were able to survive the fight, they would be hunted until they escaped the valley. Considering they would have to fight their way through Moon Wolf Citadel in order to escape, fighting the guards was the last thing they wanted to do.\"Can you guarantee to hear us out if we remove the barriers?\" It was obvious from the skinny Wolfkin's voice that he was getting slightly desperate.\"Fourteen seconds.\"\"Okay, okay, just hold on, we'll take it down.\" In the face of Thorn's unrelenting count, the skinny Wolfkin waved frantically to a few players in the crowd, who hurriedly canceled their spells. Rumbling, the stone pillars blocking the road started to sink into the ground, soon disappearing as if they were never there. Pulsing with a red light, the thorny vines started to turn brown, withering away as their vitality vanished. \"I will be expecting you tomorrow morning. You can talk to Captain Del'har regarding the specific appointment time. Now, clear the road. Anyone who continues to loiter will be considered a rabble-rouser and will be treated as such.\" Without waiting for an answer, Thorn turned away from the crowd of Wolfkin players and walked back into the citadel. Instructing the captain on what to do, Thorn watched until the carts began moving again before he returned to the fortress.Talking casually with Lady Sere, Thorn led the way to a sitting room. All of the rooms in the fortress had at least one piece of furniture that was built for his size, allowing him to sit comfortably wherever he went. Just as he settled into his seat, a large raven flew in through the window. A swirl of shadow surrounded the raven, revealing Corvo in his ragged cloak.\"How did it go?\"\"Went well.\" Corvo shot a glance at Lady Sere, who was sitting on a couch, listening attentively. Seeing Thorn motion for him to continue, he shrugged and sprawled out on a chair. \"I got good pictures and details of everyone, so I should have IDs on most of them shortly.\"\"Good work.\" Thorn's face still had that mild smile, but his eyes revealed his anger. \"One hundred gold says it is Sylith trying to mess with us, but I don't want to miss anyone who might be targeting us.\" Thorn turned to the listening noblewoman. \"Alright, time for me to go to bed. Esme, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. If you are interested in hearing the complaints tomorrow, I'll be scheduling the hearing for ten in the morning in the throne room. You can just show up.\"\"I look forward to it.\" Rising to her feet, Lady Sere curtsied. \"Thank you for your hospitality, Thorn. I look forward to learning more about you and your land.\"After seeing the inspector off, Thorn's smile faded. His face grim, he glanced at Corvo, who felt an invisible pressure wash over him. Radiating a dangerous aura, Thorn walked to his seat and sat down. Corvo gulped, secretly glad that Thorn's anger was not directed at him. There was something terrifying about watching the Titan when he was upset. \"I want to know who each and every one of those players are. I want to know who they play with and what ties they have to our enemies.\" \"Not a problem, I'll dig them up.\" \"Good. If you need to, feel free to use Avalon.\"\"We should not need to. Our network has gotten pretty extensive. Plus, I have lots of connections.\" Corvo's face broke into a smile as he threw Thorn a wink. \"Remember, finding secrets is what I do.\"\"Yeah, good point. I'll leave it up to you, then.\" Returning Corvo's grin, Thorn's tension eased. \"Alright, I really need to go to bed. It has been a while since I slept last, and I feel like I am about to rip someone in half.\"\"Why don't you go to bed?\" Remembering the unfortunate metal bed that Thorn had ripped from the cell wall when they first met, Corvo took a subtle step back.\"Alright, goodnight.\"\"Oh, Thorn, wait.\" Just as Thorn was about to leave the room, Corvo smacked his forehead and called out. \"Can you give me like ten minutes? I have someone to introduce you to. I think it is really important that you meet him. He might be able to ease some of the issues with the World Quest while you are tied up.\"\"I mean, I won't turn down help.\" Shrugging, Thorn returned to his seat.\"Great, wait just a second, I'll go call him. You won't regret this.\" As Corvo hurried from the room, Thorn took the opportunity to write a message to Velin. Just as he was about to send it, he saw her come online and opened up a video call.\"Hi, you look tired.\" \"Nice to see you, too.\" The sight of the beautiful elf brought a smile to Thorn's face, despite his fatigue. Rubbing the bridge of his nose, Thorn sighed. \"You know, when I decided to start all this stuff, no one mentioned how utterly exhausting it would be to deal with everything that comes along with leading a guild. Do other guilds go through this sort of thing?\"\"No, but other guilds are not within striking range of the top ten as soon as they form.\" Velin's lips curled slightly at Thorn's whining. \"Nova Luna is threatening quite a few different powers all at the same time. Most guilds, even the big ones, try to focus on one enemy at a time.\"\"Sheesh, it isn't like I went around spitting on people. Why is everyone so upset?\"\"I wonder, Baron Greymane, the Moon Wolf, avatar of Hati, Inheritor of the Temple of the Moon, leader of the Wolfkin, owner of Moon Wolf Citadel, and ruler of Fang Valley. You are only the first player to be a landed noble, and you happen to have taken the only known means of becoming a noble from the third strongest guild in the game.\"\"Yeah, I guess that is a pretty good reason to be worried.\"\"Pretty good? Thorn, if you were not a walking raid boss, they would have hunted you down to kill you until you quit playing Nova Terra. If I can be honest with you for a moment, I can only assume that you were born under a lucky star because I have never seen a bigger cheat in my life. And I have been playing this game since the day it opened.\"\"Heh, I guess I am pretty strong.\" \"Yes. You are pretty strong.\" For a moment, Thorn imagined that he heard sarcasm in Velin's voice, but it was gone as soon as he noticed it.\"But seriously, I will probably be tied up here for at least a few more days, which means I won't join you for almost a week. Are you going to be alright handling the next stage of the World Quest?\"\"Yes, we can always use your strength, but this stage is manageable without you.\"\"What does it look like? Have you gotten any details?\"\"Yes.\" Through the video chat, Thorn could see Velin opening her notebook. \"Asher was kind enough to share his observations after Aurum's first run.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

Flipping through her notes, the Elven War Priestess got ready to discuss what she knew about the labyrinth stage of the World Quest. \"The next stage of the World Quest is probably the last. Normally World Quests have more than three stages, so if it truly is the last stage, I would anticipate that it will be quite a challenge. If you remember from the quest description, we are supposed to search the labyrinth city of Rakkam for some sort of stone heart so that we can destroy it. According to what Asher shared with us, this stage really is a giant labyrinth. \"Aurum's first run took about eight hours before they retreated. According to what they reported, they only managed to map out around 4 miles of tunnel due to how complicated the terrain was. The gate we are using leads into a section of the labyrinth city that is filled with flames and magma. According to the rumors, there are at least four gates that all lead to a different section of the labyrinth city. Each section has a different environment based on what part of the city it was prior to becoming a labyrinth.\"So far, the entirety of the labyrinth is like a Dwarven city. The area where we landed appears to be the forges. From what I can figure, the different sections of the city are arranged in a circle. Each section stretches toward the center, and if you go too far right or left, you will enter a different environment. That means that as long as we keep going deeper in the forges we should come to the center of the labyrinth where we will presumably find the stone heart, whatever that is.\"However, Aurum reported a lot of traps, so I would anticipate that it will probably be slow going. The good news is that the two Dwarven earth maps have been showing more signs of activity, so I can only assume that when we enter Rakkam they will be able to lead us to some sort of treasure.\"\"Are there any enemies? Or is it just traps?\" Thorn stifled another yawn.\"Yes,\" Velin flipped to a new page before looking up. \"Asher mentioned that they faced off against a number of golems and fire elementals. There are no reports of dwarves, which is interesting. I can only assume that the enemy we face will be determined by the section of the city we enter through.\"\"Yeah, that makes sense. When do you plan to go in?\"\"We will be entering starting at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning. I will let you know what we see. You do look tired, though, so try to get some sleep. I will handle making progress on the next part of the World Quest, so you just focus on your responsibilities there. We have a good team, Thorn. You can trust us to do a good job.\"\"Thank you, Velin.\" \"Of course, my Lord. Remember, you don't have to do everything yourself. Make sure to lean on Corvo. He has a good head on his shoulders and a lot of connections.\"\"Will do. Say hi to Mina for me, alright? I'll try to wrap things up here and join you as soon as possible.\"\"That sounds good. Bye.\" Waving to Thorn, Velin ended the call. Yawning, Thorn leaned his head back on his chair and closed his eyes as he waited for Corvo to return. Velin had a great point, but Thorn found it difficult to put into practice. Increasingly, Thorn was surrounded by highly competent players, yet he still found it a real challenge to entrust important things to them.His life had always been controlled and predictable. Each day had been well ordered and largely uniform, and within those bounds Thorn had been able to control what went on. Since taking on the role of Lord Greymane, Thorn had experienced an unprecedented level of freedom. If he wanted to go somewhere new, no one could say anything. If he wanted to start a new endeavor or build his guild in a particular way, he could. Yet, with this freedom came a lack of control that Thorn had not anticipated. Sure, he was free to climb whatever mountain he wanted, but he had no control over how challenging it would be, or if anyone else would try to stop him. He had thrown himself into building Nova Luna only to find that other people took exception to his progress, and rather than directly confront him, they erected barriers in his way.Thorn had never anticipated how difficult it was to have freedom. When he had been locked away in the quarry, mining Fire Iron, life was easy. His choices were few, and everyone around him was similarly confined. Now, in the free and open world, his choices were endless, but so were the choices of everyone else.At the end of the day, Velin was correct. He could not be everywhere at once, handling everything at once, no matter how much he wished otherwise. And micromanaging Nova Luna would prevent it from becoming the guild that he wanted it to become. If nothing else, the time Thorn spent with his aunt in the real world had taught him that for an organization to grow, the individual members had to have ownership, and the quickest way to kill that feeling of ownership was to micromanage.\"Hey, Thorn.\" Corvo entered the room, accompanied by an old man. \"This is Baxby. Baxby, this is Baron Greymane.\"\"Thorn. Just call me Thorn.\" Rising to his feet, Thorn towered over the slightly hunched old man, offering his large hand. Two different colored eyes stared back at him, one a deep brown, the other a muddy-green. Close-cropped white hair showed his advanced age, but as they shook hands, the old man's strong grip made Thorn think he wasn't quite as old as he appeared.\"Pleased to meet you, Thorn.\" Shaking the offered hand, Baxby sized up the Titan. \"Baxby is a Drifter who specializes in hunting for treasure. He had expressed some interest in Rakkam, the labyrinth city in the world quest, and I thought we might be able to use the help since we don't have anyone with his skillset. We are competing with Ragnarok, so I figured we could use every advantage we can get.\"\"I agree.\" Thorn tried to keep his fatigue out of his voice as he offered Baxby and Corvo seats. \"Tell me a bit about yourself, Baxby. Corvo called you a drifter?\"\"Yes. Though, these days, I feel a bit more like a hobo,\" Baxby deadpanned. \"Sorry, I feel like I am missing something.\" Thorn glanced at Corvo, and Baxby didn't miss the confusion in his eyes. \"Aren't drifters and hobos the same thing?\"\"The Drifters are an organization.\" Baxby cocked his head slightly as he revealed a pin with a symbol that Thorn had never seen before. \"We're a loose association of players that work as treasure finders, explorers, map makers, and the like. However, recently most of the Drifters have drifted into one of the major guilds and are no longer offering their services to the public. There are only a few of us that are still unaffiliated, which has caused the organization to stagnate.\" \"I assume you are still offering your services, right?\"\"Oh, yes.\" Baxby reached up to scratch his neck. \"I'm the best there is when it comes to sniffing out treasure, and I guarantee that you will not regret hiring me. I don't do fighting stuff, but I don't need anyone to protect me either.\"\"Talk me through how you can help. You talk about being a treasure finder. Can I assume that you have a class for it?\"\"Lost Treasure Hunter. Still not sure if Lost refers to Treasure or Hunter, but either way I have a nose for being able to sniff out hidden and lost valuables. Especially the ancient ones.\"\"That sounds like a very useful skill. Are you interested in joining a guild? Nova Luna would love to have you.\"\"Nah.\" Waving his wrinkled hand, Baxby slowly shook his head. \"I've had more than my fill being under other people. Spent all my years before I started playing working for the man, so I'll pass. I'm happy to work with you and your guild on a contract basis, but I'm only here for discovering new things.\"\"No problem. If you are ever interested in joining up, let me know. I'll let Corvo work out the details with you, but you'll be heading down to join Velin and the Nova Luna team at a place called Embersplit Mine. We are competing with Ragnarok and Aurum in this stage of the World Quest, and your help is appreciated.\"After saying goodbye to Baxby and Corvo, Thorn dragged himself to bed, setting his alarm for six the next morning so he could join one of the morning training sessions at the temple. As tired as he was, that was no excuse for him to slack off in his training. By the time his alarm went off, Thorn was feeling rested, and it was with a spring in his step that he made his way to the training ground.Falling in with the other disciples from the Dawn Court, Thorn began to practice his basic forms. Some standard body-weight exercises got them warmed up, followed by a bit of sparring between the courts. Normally, the support oriented Dawn Court came out on the bottom of these sparring sessions, but with Thorn around they stood firmly at the top.After the morning training session had finished up, Thorn refreshed himself and hurried off to eat breakfast, a monstrous endeavor that carried on right up to ten o'clock when he was supposed to meet with the player representatives. Rising from the table, Thorn stretched his massive frame and strolled into the throne room.Similar to his entrance the day before, the protesting Wolfkin players were clumped together in the middle of the room. Thorn's sharp senses picked up the players' nervous breathing as he strolled by. Suppressing a small smile that rose to his lips, Thorn ignored the players, walking directly past them to the Wolf Throne. Turning to face the room, Thorn's eyes swept over the room before he sat down.\"Greetings, my Lord.\" Captain Del'har saluted Thorn, dropping to one knee.\"Rise.\" Even though Thorn was not a fan of the theatrics that came along with being a landed noble, he had to admit that it had its place. Intimidating players who were coming to try to squeeze benefits from him ranked at the top of his list of reasons to use theatrics. \"Thank you, my Lord. There are three things I would like to bring to your attention this morning. Greymane Village has reported a number of missing villagers and would like to issue a reward for anyone who can bring back information on this subject. The Mayor, Charles, has asked that you sign the reward to lend some weight to it. \"Second, we have increasing reports of giant wolves being sighted near the mountains at the end of the valley. The native Wolfkin hold them in high regard, but many of the travelers are hunting them, which is leading to friction. The third thing is the group of travelers you see here, my Lord. They have some complaints that they would like to bring to your attention.\"\"Tell the mayor that I am happy to sign. Have him draft the request and give it to Corvo to stamp on my behalf. If the reward is not enough to help resolve the situation, you are free to send the disciples to assist. The Temple of the Moon will not sit idle while villagers go missing. As to the second issue, you should seek out Elder Havva for guidance. Find out what you can about the wolves and report back to me. In the meantime, warn the travelers that they are not to hunt the wolves. If they still do, just throw them in jail.\"Turning his eyes from the captain, Thorn took in the collection of players who had come to complain. It looked to be the same group that had stepped forward last night when Thorn had confronted them along the road. Much of their original bravado was gone, replaced by cautious trepidation.\"You may approach and state your concerns.\" Thorn dropped his chin into his palm, leaning his elbow on the carved armrest of the Wolf Throne as he stared at the group of players.\"Uh...thanks...Baron.\" It was quite obvious that the players were not used to addressing another player in a position of authority over them by the way the leader fumbled the greeting. Seeing Captain Del'har's grip on his sword tighten, the thin Wolfkin player stepped forward nervously.\"Lord Baron, thank you for meeting with us. My name is Pierce, and I am representing the Brotherhood of the Wolf. We are a group of concerned players who have gathered to address a few of the injustices we see here in the valley. We...\"\"Brotherhood of the Wolf? Do you not allow women in the group?\" Thorn asked suddenly as he stared at Pierce in curiosity.\"Uh...no, I mean, we do.\" Taken aback by the interruption, it took a second for Pierce to process Thorn's question. \"We... We represent all Wolfkin.\"\"Surely not all Wolfkin. The captain, for example? You probably don't represent him. What about the disciples from the Temple of the Moon? I'm pretty sure I would have heard about it if you represented them. And there seem to be a fair number of native Wolfkin who have not raised any concerns. Do you represent them?\"\"Um...\" Floundering, Pierce looked at the rest of his group only to find them avoiding his gaze. Growing frustrated, the thin Wolfkin sneered and turned back to face the Wolf Throne. \"I counted one hundred and three players last night.\" Here Thorn's voice took on a slight edge. \"One hundred and three players blocking my road. Even if that is only a tenth of the players you represent, the final number is, no doubt, a tiny fraction of the total number of Wolfkin players in the valley. You might not know, but playing as a Wolfkin has become quite a popular option these days. The population of the valley has grown substantially and continues to bloom. And you expect me to believe that your group represents all of them?\"\"Baron Greymane, we are here to present our grievances, not argue about our influence,\" Pierce spat out in a frustrated voice.\"Oh, sure. Sure. I would just ask that you be accurate in how you represent yourselves. It does us no good if you blow your influence out of proportion.\" A ghost of a smile floated on the Titan's lips. \"So, tell me. With what do you take issue?\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!\u00a0Are you interested in reading the rest of Book #3?

Lounging on the Wolf Throne, his finger tapping on the armrest, Thorn kept his eyes fixed on the thin Wolfkin player standing before him. Pierce's companions had abandoned the role of speaker to him, much to Pierce's disgust.\"So? What do you have? Lay it on me.\" Taking advantage of Pierce's hesitation, Thorn prodded the thin Wolfkin to hurry. \"I don't have all day, so if you have a complaint, then spit it out.\"\"Ye... Yes, Baron.\" It was obvious from his body language that Pierce found Thorn to be intimidating, but he gathered his courage and, taking a small step forward, began to speak.\"Lord Greymane, I am here on behalf of the Brotherhood of the Wolf. The Brotherhood of the Wolf is...\" Seeing the impatience beginning to blossom on Thorn's face, Pierce choked and jumped ahead in his speech. \"Uh, we have a number of smaller complaints and one major issue. I will present them in order from lesser to greater.\"First, many of the Wolfkin players who are not part of the Temple of the Moon are frustrated because the prices of goods are higher in the valley than elsewhere. Because we in the brotherhood are not associated with the temple, we don't enjoy the discounts that the disciples get. This makes progression more difficult. We feel that this is an unnecessary burden. We would like to request that you make the discount available to all Wolfkin.\"Our second issue is on the matter of quests. Most of the quests seem to be tied to the temple, which is fine if you are a disciple, but it does not work well if you are taking an independent path. For example, I am a Hunter, which really limits the sorts of things I can do in the valley. Especially since the ban on hunting wolves was implemented this morning. It will only get harder for me to progress in the valley.\"\"Hold on.\" Thorn held up his hand to stop Pierce. \"Why don't we deal with these one at a time?\"\"Uh... su... sure.\"\"Alright, the first issue. You want a discount without being affiliated with the temple, right?\"\"Yes.\" Behind Pierce the rest of the gathered Wolfkin players nodded along.\"No. Not happening.\" Thorn sat up and waved his hand dismissively. \"If you want the discount, join the temple. If you want cheap goods, go somewhere else. There are plenty of places in Nova Terra for you to go. This is not a charity. Prices are set based on the cost of bringing goods into the valley, so unless that changes, prices will stay the same.\"\"But...\"\"Now, on to the second question.\" Not giving Pierce the chance to argue, Thorn moved on. \"Your second issue is that you are not getting enough quests?\"\"Uh, ye... yes.\" Pierce knew the conversation was starting to turn sour from Thorn's skeptical expression.\"What does that have to do with me? I don't generate quests, the game does.\"\"We thought you might be able to help provide a few more non-temple specific quests...\" Pierce's voice trailed off as he listened to his own words.\"I don't think I need to explain why that is a stupid complaint, right?\" Thorn's eyebrows rose as he stared at the thin Wolfkin and the other players behind him. \"I'm not responsible for generating quests for you. You'll have better luck taking that up with the creator of the game than complaining to me.\"\"But all the quests are tied to the temple!\" \"Ah, I wondered how long you could resist speaking.\" Resting his chin in his palm, Thorn gazed steadily at the mohawk-sporting Wolfkin who had just burst out of the crowd. \"Look, I did not make you choose to play as Wolfkin. I did not create the valley or the narrative setting surrounding the Wolfkin. I just oversee it. I did not force you to interact with the temple, and the consequences of not interacting with the temple are on you. If you want more quests, my only recommendation is that you search harder. From my understanding, if you look hard enough, you should be able to unearth something. And if that fails, you can always join in on the World Quest.\"\"This...!\"Lifting his hand abruptly, Thorn caused Mohawk to choke on his words.\"Enough. There is no more to say on this subject. Now, what other complaints do you have? You still have fifteen minutes, so make good use of them.\"\"Uh... Yes. There are a number of other complaints that we have been tasked with delivering to you, but many of them boil down to a single problem. Rather than waste our time on all the peripheral issues, let's cut to the chase and deal with the main problem.\" The thin Wolfkin pushed Mohawk back into the crowd and faced Thorn squarely. If it were not for his fingers pinching the bottom of his shirt, Thorn would never have guessed that Pierce was filled with nervousness. \"The most pressing issue for us, the players who have chosen the Wolfkin form but chosen not to bow to the temple, is the lack of moonstones.\"Seeing Thorn's eyes narrow, Pierce felt emboldened. Straightening, he coughed to clear his throat and pointed at the figure on the Wolf Throne.\"Currently, the only way to gain a moonstone is by pledging to the temple and joining Nova Luna or one of the two associations; the Night Walkers or Moon Guardians. We are here to protest this. No one should be forced to join you in order to continue playing this game. Nova Terra is a game of freedom, not tyranny. But this valley is quickly becoming an example of the second and not the first!\"As Pierce's impassioned words faded, the throne room fell silent. His face impassive, Captain Del'har stood at the foot of the stairs leading up to the Wolf Throne. Seated above, Thorn watched the crowd of Wolfkin players with calm eyes. The silence stretched out, causing Pierce's confidence from a moment before to waver. Unable to help himself, he glanced back at the group behind him only to be met with shrugs and frowns.One minute stretched into two minutes and then into four. Still, Thorn sat quietly, the look in his eyes unfathomable. Finally, unable to stand the silence, Mohawk stepped forward and opened his mouth, only to have Pierce grab him by the arm.\"Baron Greymane, don't you think you should say something?\"\"Oh? Was that it?\" Thorn slowly sat up, his face showing his surprise. \"I assumed there must be more to your speech.\"\"More?\"\"Yes, more.\" Sighing, Thorn rubbed the bridge of his nose. \"I assumed you would have a coherent, well thought out, persuasive argument that amounted to more than whining. I see I was mistaken.\"\"What! You...\"\"Enough.\" Thorn's voice was heavy, silencing Pierce's protest. \"Even if you don't have anything better to do than complain about pointless things, I do. Either give me a good reason why I should listen to you or get out.\"\"This...Baron, this is a serious issue.\"\"Oh? Is it? The mass majority of players seem content to take up quests for the Temple of the Moon even if they don't end up becoming disciples. Yet you come here and try to feed me a line about my rule being tyrannous? Captain, see them out.\"Before Captain Del'har could take a step forward, another figure pushed out from the middle of the crowd. At least two feet shorter than the seven and a half foot Wolfkin, the figure was dressed neatly. Gleaming black boots with a golden tassel matched his black vest. Intricate embroidery in gold thread climbed his vest, marking him as either a noble or a wealthy merchant. Flicking the lace at his wrists, the man bowed courteously to Thorn.\"My dear Baron, please allow me to speak. My friends here are plain and honest folk who lack an understanding of the particulars of court. Please excuse their lack of knowledge.\"\"And you are?\" Leaning back in his seat, Thorn looked down at this new figure through narrowed eyes. Despite his advanced senses, he had not noticed a human among the Wolfkin earlier and was taken aback when he appeared.\"Ah, how remiss of me, Baron. My name is Harris, my Lord. I am an...associate of this group.\"\"Oh?\" Thorn's sharp gaze had not missed the relief that appeared in Pierce's eyes when Harris stepped forward. \"Then tell me, Harris, why should I not have my captain throw you out?\"Glancing at the tall Wolfkin captain in his gleaming black armor, caution flashed across Harris' eyes. Turning back to Thorn, Harris had just flashed his most winning smile and opened his mouth when the door opened behind him and Lady Sere entered, her skirts rustling.\"Good morning, my Lord, I hope I am not interrupting anything.\" Esme walked forward passed the group of players until she stood next to the well dressed human. Looking around with curiosity, she smiled prettily. \"I can come back if you are occupied.\"\"Good morning, Lady Sere.\" Thorn waved casually from where he sat, his eyes still fixed on Harris. \"You are not interrupting anything. Harris here was about to tell me why I should not have him and the others here forcibly removed from my throne room.\"\"Ehem, yes, as I was about to say, it is not our desire to stir up trouble unnecessarily, Baron Greymane.\" Slightly thrown off by Lady Sere's entrance, Harris recovered quickly. \"This situation, as you have no doubt already ascertained, has the potential to be both big and small. It could be, at your whim, as small as a molehill. However, it also has, if not dealt with, the potential to become a crushing mountain. As I have observed the valley, I have been quite impressed with your intelligence, Baron, so I know that you can understand what I am talking about.\"\"Explain.\" A slight frown gathered between Thorn's brows as he watched Harris.\"Of course, of course.\" With a flourish of his sleeves, Harris bowed again, repeating the motion toward Lady Sere. Like a performer about to give a monologue, he raised one of his hands, reminding Thorn of an ancient bullfighter. \"The resurgence of the Wolfkin race is an occasion to be celebrated, as is their joining to the empire. The empire welcomes all of those who seek to work together for the betterment of the continent. Already, the Wolfkin race has shown itself to be a powerful force, and I have no doubt that trend will only continue.\"Baron, you are to be commended. Though you are not a member of the Wolfkin race, you have still gained their allegiance through the Temple of the Moon. I do not mean to question the ancient traditions, but I wonder if you have thought through this fully. Why don't we take the moonstones, for example.\"A pale glow flashed in Harris' hand causing Captain Del'har to step forward, his hand on his sword. With a flick of his wrist, Harris revealed a glowing moonstone. Smirking at the captain, who slowly relaxed, the human waved the moonstone at the large figure on the throne.\"Who would have thought that the Wolfkin's power is tied to a physical object like this? Well, it is not that uncommon actually. Elves need special leaves, Dwarves need special rocks, even Demonkin need special material in order to fully unlock the power in their bodies. Now that I think about it, Humans are the only ones who don't have the ability to increase their body's power. Such a shame, really. \"Still, I must congratulate the Wolfkin for having a readily available source of moonstones. It is quite rare for a race to have such easy access to the resources they need in order to advance. This rare situation has allowed the Wolfkin to experience a tremendous period of growth, which is exciting, not only for the Wolfkin but for the empire as a whole as the strength of the citizens is the strength of the empire.\" Throwing a sharp glance at Lady Sere, his grin grew wider. \"Conversely, anything that stands in the way of strengthening the empire must be carefully examined.\" Here, Harris' tone became somber as he stared up at the figure on the Wolf Throne. \"As your people grow, Baron, they will require moonstones to fully explore their power. Yet you have locked this valuable resource behind allegiance to an ancient power of dubious origin. I need not tell you that the Empire will not look kindly on anyone who is hindering the growth of its people or demanding that they pledge their allegiance to another power.\"\"Insolence.\" Captain Del'har barked, his hand on his sword. \"Do not profane our beliefs, human.\"\"I wouldn't dream of it, my dear captain.\" Harris didn't bother to hide his sneer. \"But know well your place.\"\"Are you finished?\" Thorn's voice held a hint of boredom, causing Harris' brow to wrinkle. \"As a matter of fact, no.\" Regaining his smile so fast that Thorn thought he might have imagined the dandy's frown, Harris flourished his hands again. \"The issue of the empire is only the first problem, my dear Baron. Apart from the fact that you are dividing the allegiance of the Wolfkin, you are going to quickly run into another problem. As you are aware, the empire is a place of law and order. Specifically, reasonable laws. Each person granted basic rights and the ability to pursue happiness as they choose. The nobles, such as yourself, are vested with enormous power, but with that power comes the charge to care for the citizens under you and provide them with a path toward a happier life.\"Tell me, Baron Greymane. Can you do that? Can you lead your people toward happiness if you bind them with shackles of ancient rules? We are living in modern times, my Lord. Placing a stranglehold on their advancement by limiting the necessary resource to only an elite few will simply embitter them. And bitterness will no doubt fester, pushing them to grumbling and complaining, and ultimately, rebellion against your rule.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

That seems like a pretty big jump.\" \"Is it though?\" Harris spread his hands, smirking. \"Think about this logically. You are forcing those that want to grow stronger to pledge their allegiance to an ancient order that can provide them no real benefits in this age. If, and I say if, the Temple of the Moon was still as strong as it used to be, then maybe it would not be an issue. But the truth is that the Era of the Gods has passed. The Temple of the Moon is a relic of the past.\"\"You...!\" Growling, Captain Del'har started to draw his sword.\"Stand down, Captain.\" Thorn's voice was cool and brooked no argument. With a disgusted snarl, the black-armored Wolfkin dropped his hand from his sword's hilt. Thorn's finger tapped on his armrest as he stared into the air, considering what he had heard so far. Out of the corner of his eye he could see Lady Sere's thoughtful expression. Shifting his gaze back to the well-dressed human, Thorn spoke in the same cool voice.\"What would you suggest?\"\"My dear Baron, I would not presume to tell you what to do, but if I were to make a recommendation, it would be that you open up your reserves of moonstones to all Wolfkin. The more accessible the stones, the stronger the Wolfkin will be as a group. The higher the level of the Wolfkin race's strength, the better the empire's treatment of the Wolfkin will be. By elevating the whole race, you will be looked upon with favor. You will be seen as a wise and gracious leader rather than a tyrant.\"\"Hmm.\" Thorn rubbed his nose, his eyes still fixed on Harris. His expression unreadable, Thorn sat up on his throne. \"Thank you all for bringing this matter to my attention. I need some time to think about this. Captain, please see them out.\"Stunned at the abrupt change in the conversation, the crowd of Wolfkin players looked at each other in dismay. They had thought that Harris' argument was beginning to sway Thorn, but he had dismissed them out of the blue. From the confusion that Harris was displaying, he was obviously taken aback as well.\"Uh, Baron Greymane? Aren't you going to talk about this?\"\"We just did. You presented your argument, and I will think about it. The subject of an important resource like moonstones and their distribution needs to be considered at great length. It cannot be settled in a simple discussion. You have raised your concerns, and I will take them into consideration as I think about it.\"As dissatisfied as they were, what Thorn was saying was reasonable, and with a bit of grumbling they allowed Captain Del'har to usher them out of the throne room. The door shut, leaving Thorn and Esme alone. A small smile on her lips, Esme curtsied to Thorn again.\"I must admit that I enjoy seeing people like that put in their place.\" Covering her mouth with her hand, Lady Sere giggled.\"It is quite satisfying.\" Thorn's face broke into a big grin. \"Tell me, do you know many people like that?\"\"Oh, too many to count. The capital is full of pretentious silver-tongued idiots like him.\"\"Well, I am happy to be of service.\" Thorn felt slightly awkward that he was sitting in the Wolf Throne while Lady Sere was standing below the dias looking up at him, but he suppressed the feeling. \"Did you get a tour of Moon Wolf Citadel? What do you think?\"\"Yes, the attendant that Captain Del'har assigned to me was able to show me around.\" Esme's eyes drifted to the balcony from which she could see the whole valley stretching out. Following her eyes, Thorn stood, and the two of them walked out on the balcony together.\"Do you care to share your thoughts?\" Thorn glanced at Esme.\"Impressive.\" It took a moment for Esme to speak, but when she did the words seemed to tumble from her lips. \"The citadel is astounding. I have never seen this style of architecture before, but it has a certain elegance hidden behind its strength. Not only is it set in a virtually unassailable position, but it is practically a city in its own right. And to think that behind its walls lies a forested paradise. The valley is beautiful, and it is obvious that the resources here are plentiful.\"The Wolfkin are lucky. To have such a land as their origin and for it to be so well protected is a boon that many races would give everything for. You may not realize it, Thorn, but for small races with limited numbers it can be very difficult to find a place to put down roots. The Wolfkin are quite fortunate to have this valley.\"\"I didn't realize that.\" Across the valley, Thorn could pick out the grey roof of the ruins of Greymane Keep. \"Tell me, Lady Sere, are you going to tell me the real reason you have come to the valley?\"\"Please call me Esme, Thorn. Otherwise I'll feel awkward.\" Esme pouted slightly. \"But what do you mean? I'm here to investigate to see if the charges that have been brought against you have any merit.\"Just as Thorn was about to reply, the door to the throne room opened, and one of the fortress' servants entered to inform him that there was a group of merchants who were requesting an audience. With a sigh, Thorn walked back up to the Wolf Throne and plopped down in it, motioning for the servant to show them in. On the balcony, Esme glanced at him, biting her lip. Watching the door, Thorn missed the flash of relief in her eyes.Once again, the doors to the throne room were opened, and a collection of well-dressed merchants walked in. Advancing until they were close to the dais, the merchants stood forward one at a time, introducing themselves. Three of the merchants were from guilds while the rest were from merchant organizations who had stores in the merchant quarter.A Dwarven player from the guild Silver Fist who introduced herself as Jona Silverhand seemed to be the spokesman for the group of merchants, and soon Thorn found himself in a familiar situation. Advancing to the front of the group, Jona Silverhand prepared to speak while the rest of the merchants gathered behind her for moral support.\"Greetings, Baron Greymane.\" Unlike the low, gravely voice that Thorn expected, Jona's voice was high pitched and a little squeaky. \"We bring greetings from the United League of Merchants.\"\"Hm.\" Thorn nodded to the short woman. \"Corvo mentioned that you had some demands?\"\"We would never bring demands, Baron.\" Shaking her head furiously, Jona denied it.\"Oh? Then what brings the League of Merchants here?\"\"We are here to propose an agreement that we feel will bring great benefit to both of us.\" Revealing a scroll, Jona looked around for someone to hand it to. Thorn was sitting up on the Wolf Throne, and normally Captain Del'har would be there to bring things like this up to him, but he was still not back. Unsure what she should do, Jona looked at Thorn, who showed no signs of moving, so she just waved it in her hand.\"An agreement that will bring great benefit to both of us?\" Thorn raised his eyebrows. \"Let's hear it.\"\"The United League of Merchants is a coalition of twenty five merchants from different groups that all have the privilege of doing business here in Moon Wolf Citadel and the Fang Valley. We are comprised of the primary importers of food and wine, weapons, armor, clothing, luxuries, and alchemical goods. In addition, over 70 percent of the carts that come in and out of the citadel belong to one of us. We are proposing to increase our investment in the citadel through the quantity and variety of goods we import by an additional thirty percent over the next year. We will also buy goods produced in the valley at three percent above the current market value.\"\"That sounds perfectly fine.\" Thorn looked slightly confused. \"Though I don't know why you expanding your business requires that you have an audience with me.\"Smiling disarmingly, Jona rubbed her hands together, her sharp eyes running over Thorn.\"In return, we would like to be granted exclusive license to do business in the citadel and the surrounding areas in addition to being granted a small tax break.\"Pursing his lips, Thorn watched the merchants clumped together down below. Corvo had warned him what the merchants were looking for, but he pretended that this was the first time he was hearing about it.\"I'll entertain the idea. What sort of license are you looking for? And what sort of tax break?\"\"Nothing too grand, nothing too grand.\" Jona waved her hands quickly. \"We want the United League of Merchants to be recognized as the only legal merchant organization in the valley. In order to make up for any business that will be lost as a result of this deal, we are willing to pay half a percent in tax on every good we bring into the valley. \"You want exclusive rights to sell and buy goods in the valley, and you want to pay half a percent in taxes?\"\"Correct.\" Jora nodded. \"But do not underestimate this tax. It sounds really low, but rather than paying a percentage of our profit, we will be giving you a cut of every single item that we sell. This half a percent cut will be paid by the merchant shipping the goods to the valley and the shop selling the good. This has the potential to be an incredible amount as the number of goods being sold here in the valley increases.\"\"You are proposing a modified value added tax.\" Rubbing his chin, Thorn leaned back, as if he was considering their offer seriously. The merchants standing down below smirked as they glanced at each other. A value added tax was a tax applied to the manufacturing, shipping, and handling of a particular good. This sort of tax would guarantee that tax revenue would be generated on every item that came into the valley, but at half a percent, it was such a small amount that it was negligible.In addition, this sort of tax was always passed on to the customer, which would invariably cause prices to rise. Since the merchants would not be paying the tax out of their profits, the burden of this tax would be borne entirely by the players who were buying their goods, rather than the merchants themselves. Were it not for the first condition of the agreement, this sort of tax was not a bad idea.However, the United League of Merchants also wanted to be the only recognized merchant group in the valley, which would effectively allow them to set the price. Value added tax relied on competition between different manufacturers, shipping companies, and sellers in order to keep costs affordable for consumers, but that competition would not exist if the agreement was signed as it had been presented. Sitting up, Thorn pretended not to notice the mocking looks from the merchants behind Jora. \"I'll need some time to talk to my advisors and to consider your offer.\"At Thorn's words, Jora's face fell. With a frown, she stared up at the Wolf Throne, her eyes meeting Thorn's squarely.\"Baron Greymane, please understand that we are not here to negotiate. If you do not want to agree, then we will pack up our things and go. And if we go, it will only be a matter of days before your land falls into ruin. Did you know that almost 60 percent of the food you eat is imported? Just imagine what will happen when you don't have the food to feed your subjects. This deal is non-negotiable. We are united in our thoughts on this, so you need to make a decision now. Will you take our deal or will you drive us out?\"\"Ah, I wondered where the blade was.\" Thorn's smile was grim. \"And here we were having such a friendly conversation. Tell me, what is to stop me from just inviting other merchants to come to the valley?\"\"The United League of Merchants is much bigger than you can imagine, Baron.\" Jora sneered, any vestige of respect gone. \"If we say that no merchants will come to your valley, then no merchants will come to your valley. We have sway beyond anything you can fathom.\"\"Sounds to me like it is your way or the highway, huh?\" \"That is exactly what it is. Do yourself a favor and sign the agreement, Baron. If you don't, I can guarantee that the next agreement will be much worse for you.\"\"Do you really think you can get away with this?\"\"Hahaha. Baron, are you really that naive? Of course we can get away with it. You might be a noble, but gold is the true medium of power in this world.\" Behind Jora, the group of merchants burst out in mocking laughter. His face hardening, Thorn began to rise from his seat. \"Don't think that you have a choice here, Baron.\" Jora's high pitched voice cut through the merchants' laughter, causing Thorn to sink back down in his seat. \"Maybe I was not clear enough with you. The United League of Merchants includes six of the most powerful merchant guilds in Nova Terra and countless native merchant associations. If we decide that you will not do business, then you will not do business.\"We have the means of controlling the production of the goods your people will want to buy. We control the shipping routes that would be used to bring those goods into the valley, and we control the shops. We have already leased more than 80 percent of the shops in your merchant quarter, and if we are unable to come to an agreement, your merchant quarter will be mighty empty. Sure, you could break the leases, but then you'd have to pay us a market value estimate of what we would make during our remaining time.\"Even if you don't want to deal with us, you don't have much of a choice. If you choose not to sign the paper, right now, we'll blacklist you and all of your subjects, making sure that you can't buy anything in any of the shops that the United League of Merchants owns in this whole region.\" Stepping forward, Jora drew herself up to her full height, somehow managing to look down her nose at Thorn, despite how much higher he was. \"Sign the agreement or starve.\"\"Hah.\" Thorn breathed out a long sigh, his face helpless. Shaking his head, he stood up from the Wolf Throne and looked down at the merchants for a long moment. \"I guess you leave me with no choice, huh?\"\"I'm glad you see things clearly, Baron.\"\"Oh, I do.\" Thorn's lips curled up in a smile. \"Guards! Arrest them.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone! Are you interested in reading the rest of Book #3?

Encircled by the razor sharp spears the guards held, the merchants stepped back, jostling against each other to try and be the farthest away. Captain Del'har held his large black blade against Jora's neck, causing the dwarf to stand as still as a statue.\"What are you...\" Her eyes darting wildly, Jora started to yell when the black blade drew a thin line on her neck, a few drops of bright red blood squeezing out onto the blade. Feeling the stinging pain, Jora froze.Slowly walking down the stairs leading to the Wolf Throne, Thorn's eyes raked over the captured merchants. A few of them were armed, but the arrival of the guards had been so sudden that they did not even have time to draw their weapons.\"Captain, please escort these people to the dungeon.\"\"Yes, my Lord.\" Despite his salute, the blade Captain Del'har held against Jora's neck never wavered. Grabbing Jora by the back of her dress, the captain casually lifted her into the air and began to stride toward the door. \"Let's go. Come along quietly, and you will not be harmed.\"\"Wait!\" Frantically calling out, Jora's arms and legs waved in the air as the captain carried her from the throne room. \"This is a mistake!\"\"Oh?\" Thorn signaled for Captain Del'har to wait. \"Why do you think it is a mistake?\"\"How can you arrest us? We have not committed any crimes. You can't just have us arrested because you want to!\"\"Interestingly enough, I can just have you arrested because I want to,\" Thorn chuckled. \"The law is quite clear that I can hold you for up to twenty-four hours if I suspect that you are fomenting rebellion, or if I believe that the safety of a noble is at risk. Though neither of those reasons is the case here, it can be done.\"Struggling against Captain Del'har, Jora tried twisting herself out of his grasp to no avail. The tall Wolfkin's grip was like iron, locking her in place. Giving up, the dwarf hung in the air as she glared at Thorn.\"Then what did we do that warrants our arrest?\" she hissed.\"You know, even if you did not ask, I would have sent someone to tell you.\" Thorn held up two fingers. \"The Imperial Law grants two cases in which a noble can be coerced into acting against their own interest. In the case of an invasion of the empire by a foreign power, landed nobles are required to provide soldiers according to their rank. In the case of a natural disaster, landed nobles are required to provide funds according to their rank. Any other instance of coercion is to be treated as an affront to the Imperial Throne and is punishable by jail time. After all, blackmail is a nasty business, and the empire does not look kindly upon it.\"Neither of those two situations is in play in this case, yet you threatened me with the collapse of my land's economy if I do not capitulate. Textbook coercion. By walking in here and threatening me, you have violated the law, granting me the perfect excuse to have you arrested. So that is what I am doing. It wouldn't have been possible if you had been less explicit with your threats, but, thankfully, you stated them quite clearly. Let me be clear: You and your associates are being arrested for attempted coercion of a noble. You will stay in jail until we have fully investigated this case and discovered who backs you. \"\"That will never stand up in court! You cannot prove anything!\" Furious, Jora glared up at Thorn, matching him stare for stare. \"It is your word against ours. Pure hearsay! And once the case is thrown out of court, you will wish you never started down this road with us!\"\"Normally, I would agree with you. It would be pure hearsay unless we had an impartial, third-party witness.\" Thorn's smile was bland, yet it sent a chill down Jora's back.\"What? What are you talking about?\"\"Not what, who. Jora Silverhand, let me introduce you to Lady Esmeria Gavlof Sere, officially appointed Imperial Investigator.\" Following Thorn's pointing finger, the merchants all looked over toward the balcony and began to tremble. Stepping forward from where she had been standing on the balcony overlooking the valley while she listened to their conversation, Esme looked back at them coldly.\"I am sure that Lady Sere would be happy to include in the report that a landed noble is being blackmailed by a coalition of merchants. I'm even more certain that the empire would be interested in investigating how many other nobles have fallen into your United League of Merchant's claws. We all know how the empire treats those who attempt to steal away its influence. Believe me when I say that you are much better off spending your days in my dungeon.\"\"Wait...\" Panic-stricken, Jora's hands began to wave again, but Thorn cut her off, not wanting to waste any more time.\"Enough. Captain, have them taken to the dungeon. I will talk to them another time.\" \"Yes, my Lord!\" Saluting, Captain Del'har handed his struggling captive over to the guards who had gathered outside the throne room. After instructing them to take the merchants away, he returned to Thorn's side. \"My Lord, what should we do about the shops and caravans?\"\"Hm? What do you mean?\"\"Normally, if a merchant is arrested, their property is seized, as well,\" Esme chimed in helpfully from the side.\"Right,\" Thorn nodded. Closing his eyes, he recited. \"Article 847c: Any material property belonging to a proven criminal belongs to the court of locale in which the criminal activity took place. During such a time as the crime has not been proven, the court is to hold their property until their guilt has been judged.\"\"Do you want us to seize their assets, my Lord?\" The captain nodded. \"If we don't, we might find others do so first.\"\"Huh. I guess that makes sense. Might as well lock them down for now. I want someone to take an inventory of all of the stores, though. If this doesn't devolve further, I don't want to be accused of stealing their stuff.\" Thorn sat back down in the Wolf Throne, rubbing his nose tiredly. \"Keep a close watch on their shops and on their caravans. There were players mixed in with that group, so there is next to zero chance that their organizations don't know what is happening. Watch the gates carefully as I am sure that they will send more people. Probably not the friendly sort of people, either.\"\"Yes, my Lord.\" Captain Del'har saluted again and strode from the room, barking orders to the guards as he went. Thorn and Esme were left alone in the throne room looking at each other. After a few minutes of silence, Thorn chuckled.\"I hope you don't mind that I've used you as leverage, Esme. I had not planned for it, but it turned out to be quite convenient that you were present.\"\"I don't need an explanation, Thorn.\" Esme's face was hard to read. Her eyes scanned Thorn's face as if searching for something, causing him to chuckle again.\"You may not need an explanation, but I do.\" Thorn's voice turned serious. \"Why would you want an alliance with a small baron in an out of the way region of the continent? What are you angling for?\"Still staring at Thorn, Esme's lips parted slightly as if she was about to speak before sinking back into silence. Undisturbed, Thorn continued to hold her gaze, letting the room fall quiet. For the last few days Lady Sere had been watching Thorn's interactions, and he had no idea what her thoughts were. However, he was no longer willing to wait. First the players stirring up trouble and then the merchants he had just thrown in the dungeon had made something very clear to Thorn. If he did not take the initiative, the game would simply sweep him away, forcing him into paths he had no desire to tread. His attempts to build a space for himself in Nova Terra had met obstacles at every turn, but that had not dampened his desire. Rather, the obstacles revealed that if he wanted to establish himself firmly, he had to work for it, facing his future with resolve.Too many things were happening outside his control for his comfort, so Thorn decided to change that as much as he was able. His attempts to elevate his position using the [Nobility Upgrade Token] had thrown him into a whirlpool of court intrigue in which he was still struggling to find his bearings, while his conflict with Ragnarok had left him susceptible to underhanded attacks from players. Truthfully, all of this made Thorn tired, but he was not about to back down without a fight.Seeing that Esme was still not willing to speak, Thorn sighed.\"Esme, my guild, Nova Luna, is engaged in the exploration of an ancient ruin, and I have to leave shortly to join them. I am happy to give you the freedom to continue looking into my territory, but I will not be here to assist you. You may enquire with Corvo regarding any of your needs. Is there anything else you wish to ask before I leave?\"Slightly startled, Esme blinked her eyes as her thoughts spun. Realizing that Thorn was quite serious about leaving and remembering how decisive he had been over the last few days, she seemed to struggle for a moment with her thoughts before visibly calming.\"Baron Greymane, do you know how the empire is divided?\"It was Thorn's turn to be taken aback by the Imperial Inspector's abrupt change in topic. Sensing that the conversation had only begun, Thorn stood up and led the way into one of the offices behind the throne. Gesturing for her to take a seat, Thorn pulled a few plates of pastries from his inventory along with a tea set. White steam curled up from the cups as Thorn carefully poured two cups. Once they were seated, Esme picked up her cup and took a dainty sip.\"If I am not mistaken, the empire is divided into four duchies and the capital. The dukes hold considerable power but are balanced by the three ministers that reside in the capital city. Over those seven is the Emperor himself.\"\"You are somewhat correct.\" Esme took another sip of her tea and set the cup down as she looked over the pastries. \"What I am about to tell you must not go beyond these walls. You have shown yourself to be a careful man over the last few days, and I am trusting that you will continue to demonstrate that quality going forward. You know about the four dukes, three ministers, and one emperor. Truthfully, the balance of power is quite a bit more complicated than that, but it will suffice. What you need to know is that the emperor has three sons, each with a chance to inherit the throne.\"\"You mean to say that there are three different groups vying for power?\"\"Exactly.\" Esme nodded appreciatively at how quickly Thorn had picked up on her drift. \"The three princes are all men of great stature and standing, each with a minister and a duke that supports them. Their conflict, while not quite at the stage of full on war, has crept into nearly every part of the empire. Officially, the war for the throne will not start for another five years. Truthfully, it started when the second prince was born.\"The first prince is supported by the Interior Minister, whom you already met, as well as the Cloudwave Duke. While the first prince is the oldest, he is also the prince with the least strength, as he has suffered from a sickness his entire life. The second prince is supported by the Great Plains Duke and the Minister of the Left while the Dirgehold Duke and the Minister of the Right support the Third Prince.\"\"But there are seven cabinet members. If each prince has a minister and a duke behind them, then that means that one of the dukes is neutral?\" \"Correct, the Ironhold Duke is not currently supporting any candidates for the throne. I'm sure I do not need to stress how incredibly intense the competition between the princes can be, so any chance to pull the Ironhold Duke to their side will be fiercely contested.\"\"Okay, but what does that have to do with me?\"\"It has everything to do with you, Baron. But before we get there, indulge me for a moment more. There are more factions at play than just the princes. I won't bore you with the details, but suffice it to say it is a tangled web. Apart from the three princes, there are two other major influences in the empire that you need to worry about, as well as a few secondary influences that could possibly get involved. \"The first is a network of merchants called the Black Coin that stretches across the land and is always seeking to expand their influence. You've met with some of the fringe members of their group already. So far, their motivation seems to be lining their pockets, and I do not anticipate them trying to get involved in the fight for the throne. That said, if any group could increase their profits significantly, they would undoubtedly jump at the chance.\"The smaller influences are trickier to pin down, and we currently don't know their motives. They are not a huge threat as none are big enough to affect the competition for the throne.\" Frowning slightly, Esme paused to take a sip of her tea. \"The only one that we are unsure of is an organization called Whispers of the Gods, or God's Oracle, or something like that. It is a new organization that has only recently come to light, so we don't have much information on it. We have no idea where it came from or what it is doing, but all the signs point to its rapid growth. Since we don't know much about them, we have to put them to the side for right now.\"Finally, there are the noble houses, which I represent. We are looking to grow our influence, regaining some of the power that we had in years past. We are tired of being pushed around by the princes and would rather have some hand in choosing our destiny, so we are hoping to approach the Ironhold Duke through you.\"\"Sure, that makes sense.\" Thorn popped a pastry in his mouth as he waited for Esme to continue.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

I mentioned that the princes each have a duke and a minister on their side, and as you correctly pointed out, this means that whichever prince is able to receive the support of the Ironhold Duke will rise above the others. There are two primary reasons for this. First, the Ironhold Duke is the emperor's brother-in-arms. They campaigned together for years, sharing rain and sun, blood and sweat, life and death. \"The Ironhold Duke wields immense personal power with the emperor. Anyone who can gain his recommendation will also be able to gain the emperor's approval. The second reason is much simpler, but also more difficult to deal with. The Ironhold Duchy produces the majority of the weapons and armor that the Imperial army uses. In addition, he has the best soldiers and the loyalty of almost 80 percent of the officers. Suffice it to say that the Ironhold Duke has nearly complete control of the empire's military strength. \"While he is technically no longer part of the military, the duke holds a lot of power. This makes him very attractive for all of the princes, and it is generally believed that whoever is able to gain his support will be first in line for the crown. Even though we do not currently support any of the princes, the nobles are interested in approaching the Ironhold Duke, as well.\"\"Huh.\" Thorn threw another pastry in his mouth, his eyes narrowing slightly as he watched Esme. Seeing that her cup was empty, Thorn refilled it with tea. \"You still have not told me how this has anything to do with me.\"\"Yes, well.\" Placing her cup down, Esme smoothed her skirt. \"Up until this point the Ironhold duchy has proven resistant to any attempts by the nobles to get closer. The duke is not a simple man, and he recognizes the danger of being too close to any influence. You, however, are an opportunity. You possess something he wants, and you currently don't belong to any of the existing powers.\"\"You want me to cozy up to the Ironhold Duke? Why would he even give me the time of day?\"\"Whether you realize it or not, you already have a number of connections with him.\" Esme smiled, pulling out a piece of paper and handing it to Thorn. \"You were only able to leave the capital city because of his interference, and you are a noble under him. These two things combined with what you have that he wants are more than enough to make us think that you can get close.\"Thorn scanned over the document and put it down on the table.\"You keep mentioning that I have something he wants. Are you talking about my army?\" \"Correct. Your status as a traveler puts you in an advantageous position when it comes to recruiting other travelers. The duke wants your immortal army. Despite his old age, he is still rather battle mad, and the idea of an immortal army that can grind his enemies to dust is too tantalizing to pass up. Though he is unlikely to ever use it himself, the fact that you would be available to defend the empire against threats would be worth it to him.\"\"Sure. Let's say for a moment that I do get close to him.\" Thorn leaned back in his chair, resting his chin in his palm. \"What is it that you want me to accomplish? How does getting close to the duke help you?\"\"While the nobles do not currently support any of the princes, we are interested in gaining bargaining power for when we do have to choose. If we can form an alliance with the last remaining neutral duke, the princes will have to be very careful how they treat us when the race for the throne begins. You may not realize it yet, but being a noble is a balancing act.\"We are constantly in a precarious position. As nobles, we guard the people against the tyranny of the emperor. At the same time, the royal family and the ministers reign us in. If we do not find a way to negotiate with the new emperor, we will continue to lose power until we are nothing more than puppets with empty titles. \"The emperor sits on the highest throne, but he does so because of us. Sadly, not all monarchs remember that. The current emperor knows who allowed him to take his seat, but the princes have no idea why they should allow us to continue existing. Unless we have the power to negotiate with them before they become emperor, the day the throne is passed is the day we die. You are a noble, so your fate is tied in with ours. We are not asking you to do anything unreasonable. We are only asking that you stand with us.\"\"And if I agree?\" Thorn's face was unreadable, giving no indication to his thoughts. \"What do I get if I join you in this?\"\"We will clear the path for your rise.\" \"Oh?\" Thorn's eyebrows rose slightly. \"Can you do that?\" \"Of course we can.\" Sitting up straight, Esme looked imperiously at Thorn, her eyes displaying her pride. \"Unless the Emperor himself stood in your way, we are able. From what I hear, the Interior Minister is the one that stood in your way when you tried to redeem the [Nobility Upgrade Token]? We will support you, and with our support, you have nothing to fear.\"Still leaning back in his chair, Thorn's eyebrows jumped again.\"If I understand this right, you are offering me what is mine by right as compensation for joining you. That seems less than sincere.\"\"Oh, no.\" Giggling, Esme put down the cup she had just picked up. \"That is just the start. You have the token already, and we will just put the right pressure in the right places to make sure you get your due. That is simply a gesture of our goodwill. We are willing to offer much more for your cooperation. The Ironhold Duke is too big of a fish for us to skimp out on. Your reward for joining us is tied in with our plan. If we succeed, you will gain a tremendous fortune. If we fail, you will not lose anything.\"\"That sounds too good to be true.\" Sitting up, Thorn leaned forward. \"But you certainly piqued my interest.\"\"I thought I would.\" Esme smiled and leaned forward as well, her voice lowering. \"The Ironhold Duke is getting older and has no heir. If you are willing to join us, we will do everything in our power to help you take that position.\"*ding* His eyes going wide, Thorn could only stare in shock at the quest that popped up in front of him. Suppressing a laugh, he minimized the notification. According to Velin, quests that led to gaining territory were incredibly rare, yet Thorn had seen two since he started playing. For a moment, his mind wandered as he thought about what it would be like to be a duke. Already quite happy with his small piece of Nova Terra, Thorn could not help but swallow as he thought about gaining control of a whole duchy.Snapping himself out of that train of thought, Thorn took a deep breath. He had plenty going on right now, and the last thing that he wanted was to get drawn further into the political intrigue of the empire. He was already struggling with the groups that had their eyes on his valley and he couldn't imagine how much harder it would be when the political behemoths started breathing down his neck.As if sensing his hesitation, Esme picked up the pot and filled up his teacup, her brown eyes meeting his.\"I know this is a lot to process, Thorn, but I want to assure you that we are very confident in you. You come highly recommended, and everything I have seen over the last few days confirms what we believed. Let's at least talk this through before you reject me.\"\"Recommended?\" Thorn gave Esme a puzzled look as he picked up the tea she had just poured for him.\"Yes. You worked with the Society of Roses previously I believe? Both the Queen of Roses and Bluefire recommended you highly.\"Thorn had to resist the urge to laugh again causing his face to cramp. \"Oh, please don't misunderstand.\" Thinking that he was angry, Esme hurried to reassure him. \"They did not share any specific details about you. My mother is one of the Society's earliest supporters and asked some general questions when she heard that you had hired them.\"\"I know Athena quite well.\" Thorn had gotten his face back under control by this point. \"Since she was the one who recommended me, I'm willing to talk this through.\"\"Thank you, Thorn.\" Esme bowed her head slightly and pulled out another document. \"There are a few things that we need to do in order for you to be eligible to be the Ironhold Duke's heir. First, you need to be known. Both the Ironhold Duke and the military must be impressed by you. I'm not talking just about your ability to fight. From what I understand, you are strong enough to go up against a greater devil, which is impressive, but we need something more. You need to be a competent general. \"You also will need to be an Earl. Once we clear the way for you to use your [Nobility Upgrade Token], you will be a Viscount, but that is not good enough. Viscounts and Barons are not eligible to have their own armies. That is to say, you cannot take your army outside of your land. Barons are allowed to have a personal force of up to five thousand soldiers, but they are not to take them out of their castle. Viscounts can have significantly more soldiers, but again, are not allowed to actually deploy them to battle outside of their land. Of course, both situations have exceptions, but your life will be made easier by becoming an Earl.\"Earls, the rank after Viscount, can have a personal army of eighteen thousand soldiers, and they are allowed to bring half of them with them when they leave their fief. Marquis can have a personal army of twenty-five thousand soldiers and, similar to an Earl, can bring half of them off their land. In order to catch the duke's attention, you will need to be at least an Earl.\"\"It is a shame that I don't have another [Nobility Upgrade Token],\" Thorn joked.\"No, it is quite good that you don't.\" Esme did not find the comment funny. \"If you had more than one, you would have been assassinated already.\"\"Hm.\" Thorn's reply was non-committal. After all the meetings he had just gone through, he would have much preferred the assassins. \"How do I go from Viscount to Earl? The [Nobility Upgrade Token] can take me halfway there, but I have a feeling that the Interior Minister is not going to want to sign off on another upgrade.\"\"He will not have a choice.\" Once again, Esme's tone revealed her pride. \"We will arrange it so that your title is advanced to Viscount without the token, at which point the [Nobility Upgrade Token] will elevate you directly to the status of an Earl. This will allow us to begin our plan. All you need to do, if you agree to work with us, is to come to your hearing in a month. We will take care of everything else.\"\"You can get me upgraded to a Viscount without the token? How? Don't I have to have some sort of merit?\"\"You don't need to worry about that.\" Esme smiled primly. \"We are very well connected, and though we will need to call in some favors, we should not have too many issues.\"\"Alright. If you can actually get me to the rank of Earl, I will do my best to get close to the Ironhold Duke. I cannot guarantee anything, but I can certainly try. The chance to upgrade my rank sounds like a pretty good deal to me.\" After thinking it over for a moment, Thorn opened up the quest notification and accepted the quest. \"A month should give me enough time to handle the expedition and clean up some of the troublemakers in my territory. I believe we have a deal, Lady Sere.\"\"Thank you, Baron Greymane.\" Esme smiled and held out her hand. \"I look forward to working alongside you.\"\"Likewise.\" Standing, Thorn shook her hand gently.\"I'm going to head back to the capital to make my report. We look forward to you joining us in a month.\"After seeing Esme out, Thorn sat back down in his chair and thought back over everything that had happened so far that morning. First came the Wolfkin with their complaints, and then the Merchants. Finally, Esme had dropped a bomb on him, dragging him deeper into the morass of the imperial power struggle. Or maybe he was wading in willingingly. It was hard to tell, as there was a part of Thorn that loved the idea of competing for power.\"What do you think?\" Thorn spoke to the empty room. With a snap of its wings, a raven that had been standing perfectly still on the top of a bookcase swooped down, transforming into Corvo. Pushing back his feathered cloak, Corvo sat down on the seat that Esme had just left, finishing off the tea left in her cup and filling it full from the teapot. \"I think that Mina was absolutely right.\" Tossing back the tea, Corvo set the cup down with a bang and began hunting through the tray of pastries. \"Mina?\" Thorn's brow furrowed. \"What did Mina say?\"\"Mina said that you are an absolute cheat. That either you are the luckiest person in this game or Eve is your mom.\" Finding a pastry that he liked the looks of, Corvo bit it in half angrily and glared at Thorn. \"You got a quest, didn't you? One for the duke thing she was talking about. No one gets quests that give them official status in Nova Terra, and you got two? What complete and utter...\" So angry he couldn't even finish his sentence, Corvo shoved the rest of the pastry in his mouth.\u00a0-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

Corvo was right, though, Thorn's luck was absurd. But since there was nothing he could do about it, what was the use in worrying? Even if he could, who would trade this sort of luck? After enjoying a good laugh, Thorn sighed.It was unfortunate that his luck did not help him with the problems plaguing him, though. With the pressure from the Wolfkin players who did not want to join the temple and the merchants he had just thrown into the dungeon, Thorn was feeling quite burdened. To add this new quest on top of that made Thorn feel like he was getting farther and farther from the freedom he was seeking.\"What do you think? Should I have turned it down?\"\"Turned down the chance to become a duke? Are you insane?\" Corvo gulped another cup of tea and stared incredulously at Thorn. \"No way, this is an amazing opportunity for all of us. Can you imagine a guild with a duke's backing? We would be unstoppable! No, this is too good to pass up. It'll no doubt be an uphill battle, but it is doable.\"\"Good, that is what I thought.\"\"Hah, a duke. Can you imagine?\" Corvo leaned back in his seat, closing his eyes as his mind whirled. \"Still, you've got other problems that you have to deal with before you focus on getting close to the Ironhold Duke. We can't start working on that quest for the next month, since you are still a baron, so our focus should be on dealing with the issues in the valley and clearing the World Quest.\"\"Do you have any thoughts on the Wolfkin situation? I at least have leverage with the merchants since they are all in jail right now, but I'm at a loss when it comes to the players who don't want to join the temple. I didn't intend to restrict other players, and I thought that it was enough that players can get a moonstone by building up their reputation with the temple. Apparently that isn't good enough.\"\"Thorn, one thing you will need to learn is that you cannot please everyone. Remember, the mass majority of players are completely content with the way things are set up. Most likely, Ragnarok or some other guild is trying to stir up trouble, and they are blowing this up to try and grasp at a weakness. Honestly, if I were you, I would be more restrictive, not less. There is no real downside to tying the Wolfkin players to a race-based organization, as they are going to do what they want anyway.\"\"You mean I should make it even harder to get moonstones?\"\"Yeah, I mean, why not? They are yours. This whole valley is yours. It is not like you owe anyone the stones. You are already being generous.\"\"But, isn't that...\" Thorn paused for a moment as he tried to come up with the right words.\"Tyrannical? Mean?\" Corvo laughed. \"Sure, some people will see it that way, but they would call you those names no matter what you do. Thorn, you built Moon Wolf Citadel, right? What if a bunch of players came to you and told you that it wasn't fair for you to own it all by yourself? Would you give them part of it?\"\"No way.\"\"Exactly. This is the same. Regardless of the fairness of how you got control of the mines, they are now yours. If you want to give the stones away, you can. But if you don't want to, no one can fault you. You know, your wealth really shows in times like these.\"\"Really? What do you mean?\"\"It is your complete disregard for stuff. Any other guild in existence would be charging a premium for the moonstones, and no one would be batting an eye. You are giving them away and still wondering if that is too mean. Sort of feels like you don't have a good grasp of how valuable they are.\"\"Ah, gotcha.\" Leaning back in his chair, Thorn nodded. \"I would say that is fair. You think I should be more restrictive, not less?\"\"That is totally up to you. It is your call at the end of the day. One of the perks of being the boss.\" Corvo chuckled, picking up another pastry.\"Sure, but you are my adviser. So advise.\"\"If it were up to me, I would be more restrictive.\" Corvo shrugged. \"I would also create a back channel for players that want to try and avoid the temple. Offer the stones through a black market of sorts and tie people in that way.\"\"Great!\" Thorn stood up suddenly, startling Corvo. \"Go ahead and do it. You have my full support. Let me know what you decide to do, but I'll give you free reign to set the policy.\"\"What? No, I didn't...\"Thorn patted Corvo on the shoulder as he walked toward the door, forcibly interrupting him.\"Don't worry about it, you'll do great. I'll tell the captain that if they come back, he should bring them to you to negotiate. If they give you any trouble, you can deal with it however you want.\" The last few words were said over Thorn's shoulder as he nearly ran out of the room, the closing door blocking Corvo's curses.Pleased to have dumped at least one of his responsibilities, Thorn ran down his mental checklist. The last thing he had to do before he was free to meet up with Velin and the rest of the Nova Luna team on the World Quest was deal with the merchants. That was going to be trickier. Making his way to the Temple of the Moon, Thorn found Elder Havva in his courtyard. The old Wolfkin was watering his plants and enjoying the morning sun. \"Good morning, Baron Greymane. What brings you to my humble house today?\"\"Morning, Elder Havva.\" Thorn gave a disciple's bow. \"I hoped that you could help me with something. An issue has cropped up that potentially affects the whole valley, and I want to consult you about a possible solution.\"\"Of course, please, come in.\" Putting down his watering can, Elder Havva led Thorn into his house. The interior of the house was simple and only contained a bed, a mat with a small table, and a small chest of drawers. Elder Havva sat on the mat and gestured for Thorn to take a seat on the floor, as well. Once the giant had settled, Elder Havva poured some tea and offered it to Thorn.\"Thank you, Elder.\" \"Of course, child. Tell me, what brings you to this old man's house.\"In the throne room Elder Havva had insisted on the strictest adherence to decorum but, in his own home, being approached by a disciple for his insight and guidance, the Elder referred to Thorn with the familiar warmth of a mentor.\"I wanted to talk to you about the Night Walkers.\" Thorn scratched his head, unsure how to phrase his question. Elder Havva sat across from him calmly blowing on his tea as he waited for Thorn to speak. \"The Night Walkers have always been disciples of the Temple, but the population of Wolfkin has never been this high. I'm starting to hear complaints from Wolfkin who don't want to join the temple, and I'd like to address them before they get blown out of proportion. There are a few hundred thousand members of the Wolfkin race now, and I am concerned that the temple is not big enough to handle all of them.\"\"It certainly isn't.\" Elder Havva shook his head and placed his tea down on the floor. \"Thorn, you can tell me what is on your mind. You are Lord Greymane, ruler of our people. You are the inheriting disciple of the Temple of the Moon and will one day be the Temple Head. The Wolfkin are bound to do as you think best, so you don't need to be so hesitant.\"\"Yeah.\" Thorn let out a big sigh. \"That is actually what is bothering me. Elder, I might be the leader of the Wolfkin, but I am not a Wolfkin. I am different. I'm giant, I'm not furry, I don't have a tail.\"\"You are worried because you are different? Child, your difference is why you can become our leader.\" Elder Havva rose to his feet slowly and walked over to the chest of drawers, retrieving a scroll. Bringing it back, he spread it in front of Thorn.\"Child, look at this. This is the history of our leaders, tracing back to the point where Hati breathed life into us. Let me tell you a story.\" Making himself comfortable while Thorn looked at the scroll, Elder Havva poured himself some more tea and, after taking a sip, began to speak. \"When the world was young, there was nothing but the endless sea surrounded by the void. From the sea rose Angoril and many other lands, each teeming with life. Yet the void was jealous of the sea's life and began to devour the sea, eating away at it a little bit at a time. Seven beings rose to protect their lands from the corrupting void, yet none could stand in its way.\"Unable to stop the void individually, the seven great beings retreated to the last land, Angoril, where, working together, they held back the void. Angoril was home to a powerful race called Titans, unmatched in both battle and arts, and it was with their cooperation that the void was stopped. For many years the seven great beings lived among them, and they were happy. Yet the seven beings eventually grew lonely, missing the beings from their now destroyed homes.\"Determined to allow their memories to live once again, the seven great beings created the myriad races, all under the rule of the Titans. If you look at the earliest record of the Wolfkin, you will see a giant with the features of a human. That was our first king, the Titan Moa'Helik, the Moon Wolf. He was the sworn brother of Hati and the ruler of all Wolfkin. Since that time, the majority of the rulers of our people have not been Wolfkin, so you don't need to worry about it, Thorn. Hati named you our leader, and our leader you shall stay.\"\"A Titan? What happened to Moa'Helik?\"\"The legends don't say.\" Elder Havva pointed to a scene in the scroll that showed a sky with a jagged cut. \"All they say is that one day the sky was ripped apart and lightning fell, destroying much of Angoril. After the sky was sundered, the Titans vanished. Not just Moa'Helik, but all of the Titans. The Era of the Gods followed as the gods rebuilt Angoril and fought against each other.\"*ding* \"Uh.\" Thorn stared at the quest that had just popped up.\"Unfortunately, any other information has been lost in the mists of time.\" Elder Havva shook his head sadly. \"All that is left are a few ruins that are obviously made for larger creatures. Still, to return to the subject at hand, there is nothing wrong with you being our leader. You share many similarities with the Wolfkin's original ruler, and that, combined with Hati's blessing, is all you need.\"\"Thank you, Elder.\" Thorn cupped his fists in a disciple's salute. \"This has been weighing on me recently with everything going on. I have been having trouble thinking of solutions that do not require me to command the Wolfkin as a whole.\"\"Of course, child. You should command us. That is your right, and your duty. Now, what is it that you wish for us to do? So long as it does not harm our people, I will support you.\"\"Recently, a group of merchants has united against us. Well, against me, really.\" Thorn paused as Elder Havva held up his hand.\"Thorn, you are Lord Greymane. Anyone or anything that sets themselves against you is setting themselves against the Wolfkin as a whole. Remember that. Continue.\"\"I will remember that, Elder. So, a group of merchants has set themselves against us. They threatened me directly, so they are currently in jail, but I would guess that the result of this will be that the goods being imported into the valley will start to dry up. We've seized the resources from the merchants, which should last us a couple weeks, but after that we'll be in trouble. All this to say, I want to start setting up Wolfkin merchants.\"The idea is to support between five and ten, maybe more, groups that will focus on importing goods into the valley. Over time, they can expand however they want, so long as they continue to supply the valley. In addition, I want to set up some mercenary groups that will provide services as guards for the merchants and take on other jobs. My goal is to have the valley be self-sufficient and well protected. \"What I am hoping is that you will help me do this, since you are very influential among the Wolfkin. Both travelers and natives will listen to you. I'm happy to provide the financing to get these groups started, and on top of providing loans, I want to open up the Night Walkers to any Wolfkin, so long as they belong to an organization that is tied in. My ambition is to help the Wolfkin grow into a single, cohesive unit.\"However, I realize that my original idea was a little naive. There are simply too many Wolfkin to absorb into the Temple of the Moon and Nova Luna. Instead, if we can offer enough benefits, I would like to forge a loose collection of organizations that all share a common core thread. Would you be willing to help me with this?\"Elder Havva did not respond for a moment, dropping his gaze to the cup in his hand. Thorn waited nervously, clenching his fist. The elder had incredible sway with the native Wolfkin because of how well he had led them in the past. Even the Wolkin players took what he said very seriously because he was a high level NPC. If Thorn could convince him to help, it would make everything much smoother. As Elder Havva's eyes rose to meet Thorn's, the giant found his breath catching.\"It would be my pleasure, Lord Greymane.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

Come explore the world of Nova Terra and help me determine where the story goes.You can find out more about me at www.sethring.com", "\"I have some conditions, however.\" Elder Havva's voice was serious, and Thorn could tell that he had considered what he was about to say for a long time. The two sat in the elder's sparsely furnished room, discussing what to do with the valley.\"What conditions? If I can grant them, I will,\" Thorn hurried to assure Elder Havva. He almost said that he would agree to them, but years of listening to his aunt hedge her bets combined with the cautious attitude Thorn had learned from his early days in the game changed the words as they came out.\"My requests are three-fold.\" Elder Havva sighed, his demeanor perking up. \"First, I wish to remove the punishment for the disciples who have been touched by Karrandras. Many of the Temple of the Moon's top disciples have been forced to meditate in isolation ever since the corrupting influence of the devil was discovered. Their absence has created numerous issues for the temple, and I hope to have them come back.\" Elder Havva paused to pour himself some tea, glancing at Thorn to gauge his reaction.Startled by the request, Thorn kept his face steady with his trademark pleasant smile. He had not thought about the corrupted Wolfkin since they got back to the valley, and had certainly not considered using them. \"Along those same lines, I hope that you can pass the title of Head Disciple back to Gelish. At one time, before your arrival, Gelish assisted me in taking care of the day to day tasks of the Temple of the Moon. Now that he has been cleansed of Karrandras' influence, I would love to have him help me once again.\"This time it was impossible for Thorn to maintain his expression. Fighting Gelish was a memorable moment in Thorn's quest to become Lord Greymane, so he had a very strong impression of the corrupted Wolfkin. The former Head Disciple had been the one to trigger the corruption in the other Wolfkin, and the idea that he could be given his old position threw Thorn off. Elder Havva's dim eyes caught the change in Thorn's face, and he quickly continued.\"The third condition is that the Dawn Court be permitted to preach.\"As Elder Havva's words settled in, Thorn's thought process was derailed completely. Taking a moment to compose his whirling thoughts, he scratched his chin. \"Why don't we chat about these conditions one at a time?\"\"Of course.\" Elder Havva sipped his tea as he waited for Thorn to begin.\"Let's take the last issue first. What do you mean by preaching? I did not realize that preaching was part of the Dawn Court's duty.\"\"Traditionally, it has not been.\" Elder Havva sighed again. \"The Temple of the Moon has always been the central force among the Wolfkin, each child raised with the knowledge of who Hati is and what we as a race owe to the god of night. This has now changed. You must realize that a few months ago our population was in the hundreds, Thorn. Thanks to the blessing of the Great Wolf, the Wolfkin who wandered Angoril have returned, allowing us to grow into the hundreds of thousands very quickly.\"Yet, we have discovered that even basic knowledge about Hati, the Moon Wolf, is unknown to the majority of these Wolfkin. What I wish is to give the order for the Dawn Court to begin teaching others about Hati. Even if they do not end up joining the Temple of the Moon, at least those who have returned will not anger the Great Wolf.\"\"Huh.\" Thorn scratched his chin again. \"I never thought about that. It is true though, most Wolfkin have no idea who the gods are. Sure, I don't see anything wrong with allowing the disciples from the Dawn Court to tell people about Hati. I don't want to see this becoming a cult or pyramid scheme, though. It is enough to educate, they should not insist that anyone join the temple.\"\"I'm familiar with cults, what is a pyramid scheme?\" Elder Havva's head cocked to the side slightly as he digested Thorn's words.\"Ah, a pyramid scheme is a scam. Don't worry about it.\"\"Hmm. It sounds like we are agreed on the third condition. Now, let's discuss the first two.\"Thorn exhaled as his eyes drifted up to the ceiling. Trying to think through all the possible ramifications of reinstating formerly corrupted Wolfkin, it was a long moment before Thorn was able to muster his voice. \"Truthfully, I'm not very confident in allowing Wolfkin who have fallen to Karrandras to hold important positions.\" Thorn shook his head, his gaze settling on Elder Havva again. \"You'll have to convince me that they are not going to cause more problems. Otherwise, I don't think I can agree to either of the first two conditions.\"\"Of course. Let me walk you through my thought process.\" Elder Havva remained unperturbed in the face of Thorn's refusal. \"As you know, the corrupting influence of Karrandras, the Betrayer, was seated deep in the hearts of the Wolfkin who fell. Since you uncovered it, I have thought long and hard about this issue and examined myself thoroughly. I discovered a few things that shed some light on why those Wolfkin fell to corruption in the first place.\"There was a time in our history when the Wolfkin race was spread across the land. Apart from the valley, which held our ancestral home, we had another home, a city built in a secluded area to the east. That city was the primary home of the Wolfkin race and held the official temple of Hati. Due to the corrupting influence of Karrandras, the leader of the Wolfkin fell into madness, desecrating Hati's temple.\"\"That was Davyos, right?\"\"Yes.\" Elder Havva gave a heavy sigh. \"Davyos was a wonderful leader, but his fall prompted the fall of the Wolfkin as a race. When Davyos desecrated the temple of Hati, a seed of corruption was planted in the hearts of the Wolfkin, a seed that grew in the dark corners. Your arrival caused that seed of corruption to bloom prematurely, which is why only some of the Wolfkin were changed.\"\"Do you think that seed is gone now that everyone has been purified?\"\"No, sadly, the corruption in our hearts can never be completely removed. But it has been made dormant, and now that we are aware of it, we can take precautions.\" Elder Havva paused to take another sip of his tea before continuing. \"But even with the seed of corruption in our hearts, our actions are still our own choice and responsibility. Everyone has the potential to betray others for their own benefit, just as they have the potential to sacrifice themselves for others.\"The lesson we learned when Gelish challenged you has fundamentally changed the Wolfkin disciples who fell, Gelish included. I am willing to act as their guarantor in this. They are an invaluable asset if you want to properly guide the Wolfkin race into a unified whole, and I am willing to bear the responsibility should they step out of line.\"\"Oh, man.\" Thorn sat back as his mind teemed with all the possible catastrophes that could come from letting the formerly corrupted Wolfkin retake their old positions. The thought of giving Karrandras a foothold in the valley was chilling. Just about to turn down Elder Havva, Thorn paused, his old sifu's words springing to mind. \"The seeds of good and evil, mixed in everyone. What you feed, grows,\" mumbled Thorn under his breath. \"Alright. Let's take the chance. I trust you, so I'll trust that you know what you are doing, Elder Havva. However,\" the tone of Thorn's voice deepened, \"if they create any trouble, please don't blame me for being merciless.\"\"Thank you, Thorn.\" The aged Wolfkin gave a small bow, delight and relief flashing through his eyes. \"You will not regret doing this.\"\"That just leaves the first condition. Since I have agreed that the formerly corrupted Wolfkin can be reinstated, Gelish is obviously part of that. From what I remember, for him to take the position of Head Disciple, he has to beat me in a fight. I don't mean to be overly proud, but the chances of that happening are zero.\"\"I completely agree.\" Elder Havva nodded, his posture relaxed. \"Not many people would be able to best you in single combat. That means that, if we want to have him assume the position, the rules must change.\"\"Can we do that? Is it alright to just change traditions like that?\"\"Rules are dead, people are alive. You are the living embodiment of that saying, Thorn. Traditionally, there are four important positions among the Wolfkin, yet you currently hold three of them. You are the Inheriting Disciple, putting you in line for my position, you are the Greymane, elected by the Temple of the Moon as the secular representative. You hold the secular title of Lord Greymane, granted by the Empire. The only thing you are missing is my position.\" Elder Havva chuckled.\"Yeah, I guess that's true. So, what do you recommend we do?\"\"Why don't we restructure the Temple of the Moon's leadership? In former times, there was a council formed by the four courts of the Temple of the Moon that governed the Night Walkers who left the valley and the Moon Guardians who remained. Why not reinstate that? I can step aside to handle other tasks, and with your permission, we can allow Gelish to assume my responsibilities as the leader of the temple. With my oversight, of course.\" Elder Havva held up his hand to forestall the questions that Thorn was about to blurt out, causing the Titan to settle back into his seat.\"It has become increasingly clear that, in order for the Wolfkin to move forward without being fractured, we must grow and change. With your blessing, I would like to take up that challenge. As part of the restructuring, I think that we should expand not only the way the temple is governed, but the way the valley is governed. Instead of assuming all of the responsibility yourself, why not share the burden of ruling by forming a council?\"\"Can you explain your idea a bit more? I'm certainly not opposed to spreading the work out.\" Despite the small part of Thorn that did not like the idea of giving up some of his control, the last few days had been exhausting, and the idea of having others to share the burden was growing more and more appealing.\"My basic idea is simple. Form a council with six seats that will help you run the valley. The first and second seat will be held by your advisor, Corvo, and a representative from Nova Luna like Lady Velin. The third seat will be held by a representative from the Temple of the Moon. For the foreseeable future, I will hold that seat. The last three seats would be held by a representative from Greymane village, a representative from the new village, Spire, that has been established and a representative from the mercenary groups.\"This will grant the citizens of the valley a wide range of representation, allowing them to feel as if they have a vested interest in the ruling of the valley. It will also reduce your workload, as the council will be responsible for debating and implementing proposals that are brought forward for the valley. The council will submit recommendations to you for final approval and will carry out the ones that you agree to.\"\"That sounds good to me.\" Rising, Thorn saluted Elder Havva. \"Thank you for your efforts on behalf of the valley. We are fortunate to have such a wise elder.\"\"Thank you, Lord Greymane.\" Elder Havva stood and returned the salute. \"It is my pleasure to serve our people.\"Walking slowly, the old Wolfkin escorted Thorn to the gate of his courtyard, where they stood talking for a moment. Once they had smoothed out the final details, Elder Havva sent one of the disciples to call Gelish and the formerly corrupted Wolfkin over. The fallen disciples had been confined together and had spent their days meditating and reflecting on why they fell.A couple of minutes later, a large group of Wolfkin disciples gathered in Elder Havva's courtyard. At the front stood Gelish, the former Head Disciple of the Temple of the Moon. The last time Thorn had seen Gelish, he had almost killed him, but there was no resentment in the former Head Disciple's eyes. Instead, the only emotions Thorn could see were respect and gratefulness.\"Thank you for coming. We are going to be instituting some changes over the next few weeks. Lord Greymane has a few words to say in that regard.\" Elder Havva addressed the thirty-six Wolfkin who had gathered before him, gesturing to Thorn who stared at him blankly for a moment. Realizing that the elderly Wolfkin wanted him to announce the changes that were being made, Thorn sighed and faced the crowd, his eyes sweeping over them. It was obvious from their well-worn look that most of the Wolfkin present were veterans.\"As the esteemed elder mentioned, we are making a few changes. First and foremost, all of you are going to have your former status reinstated. Elder Havva has examined you carefully, and while the seed of corruption still exists, so long as you practice restraint, you shouldn't have trouble repressing it. That said, if you do have issues, please let us know immediately. Elder Havva is taking responsibility for all of you, so don't let him down. \"Next, as part of reinstating you all as disciples, you'll be helping to manage the Temple of the Moon.\" Hearing murmurs break out, Thorn held up his hand for quiet. \"You are all veteran disciples, and we desperately need your knowledge and wisdom. You'll be given a probationary period and will be expected to report to the Head Disciple. That position will be granted to Gelish.\" This time the crowd went completely silent.\"The Temple Elder and I have talked this through, and we believe that the current times will no longer allow us to act as we have in the past. Together we have agreed that, not only will Gelish be the new Head Disciple, but he will take on the day-to-day operation of the temple. You will report to him, and he will report to Elder Havva. The Temple Elder will be taking up a position on the new Valley Council that is being set up.\" Pausing slightly, Thorn glanced at Elder Havva and suddenly grinned. \"If you have any questions or concerns, see the Temple Elder.\"As soon as the words left his mouth, Thorn hurriedly saluted the old Wolfkin and ran out of the courtyard before he could say anything. Ignoring the shouts behind him, Thorn quickly left the Temple Quarter, heading toward the front gate. With the last item checked off his list, he was determined to leave before anyone or anything else could try to suck up his time. As he ran past the disciples guarding the gate, Thorn waved and took off.\"Status.\" -----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

On his way to meet the rest of the Nova Luna team, Thorn's mind drifted back to his conversation with Elder Havva. The older Wolfkin had been willing to help Thorn, but the conditions he put forward, chief among them that Thorn allow Gelish, the disciple Thorn competed against, to resume the head disciple position, were still a bit worrying, but Thorn trusted Elder Havva. Assured that things would be settled soon, Thorn was now hurrying to the mine to rejoin the team exploring the labyrinth. Over the last few days the teams had settled into a rhythm, spending six hours at a time pushing into the foundry district of the labyrinth city. Longer runs quickly became dangerous, as the temperature of the district grew hotter the longer a player stayed. Thankfully, it soon became apparent that the initial portion of the labyrinth was an instanced dungeon. Rather than having to compete with each other directly in the labyrinth, the dungeon was duplicated every time a new group entered, saving their progress without interfering with the other group's experience. This allowed the three guilds to explore at their own pace. So far, Nova Luna had explored a small part of the foundry district, mainly focusing their attention on understanding the labyrinth. As he rushed through the mine, Thorn's eyes caught a glint of dark metal in the walls of the tunnels, reminding him of a message Velin had sent the night before. Scouts had found numerous veins of ore around the fortress, including a large kardium crystal vein, increasing the value of the fortress immeasurably. Thorn was starting to regret that he had given up the fortress to Ragnarok. Arriving at the guild's camp outside the fortress, Thorn greeted the guards keeping watch and asked where Velin was; he was directed to the large tent in the center of the camp. As Thorn strolled through the camp, the players he came across all stopped what they were doing to greet him. A few months ago, this level of attention would have made Thorn feel very self conscious, but now he just returned their greetings with nods and waves. Ducking into the tent, Thorn was pleasantly surprised to find that he could stand up to his full height. The expansive tent was dominated by a large table with a map of the labyrinth laid out on it. A highly detailed drawing of the portions that the guild had explored appeared in the corner of the paper, fading to blankness where they had yet to set foot. When Thorn entered, Baxby, the treasure hunter from the Drifters, was bent over the map carefully adding a hallway while Velin watched.Hearing someone come in, Velin looked up, a smile lighting up her face at the sight of Thorn. She gestured for Thorn to come over before she resumed watching as Baxby added the last few lines. The old man straightened up as he looked over his work. Giving a satisfied nod, he noticed Thorn and grinned.\"Hey kid, finally got around to joining us, huh? Let me tell you, it is a good thing you hired me. You nearly left a fortune behind in the maze. There was a whole room of precious material and a treasure chest with some pretty cool gear. You all walked right passed it.\"\"In our defense, both were behind secret doors.\" Velin's normally cold face had not stopped smiling since Thorn arrived. \"Still, Baxby is right. He has done a great job already.\"\"Heh. Just don't forget my cut. If there are more treasures, I'll sniff them out for you.\"\"What's this?\" Thorn stepped over to the map, his eyes running over the carefully drawn lines.\"I told you that I am a map maker, right? Or did I forget to mention that?\" Baxby cackled, scratching his white hair. \"I forget who I tell what sometimes. One of the benefits of having lived forever, I guess.\"\"This is what we've covered, right? Can you give me a rundown of how the exploration has gone so far?\"\"Of course.\" Thorn did not know if it was just habit, but as soon as Velin pulled out her notebook, her demeanor went back to her normal cool state. Scanning her notebook, she began to talk. \"As you can see, progress has been limited. We expect that we've covered less than a third of the dungeon over the last few days. Normally, there is a boss of some sort, but we have yet to discover anything. Our most common enemy so far has been a type of fire elemental formed from the flames that still burn in the forges. We have also encountered magma slugs, but they have been rare. \"Since we have Baxby's assistance, we took the day yesterday to re-explore the areas we had already covered so that we could map it. The plan from here is to push forward and see what we can find that is new. Our goal is to hit the first boss by the end of the week. Since we are competing against other guilds, we're trying to make as much progress as possible.\"\"Have the Dwarven earth maps been helpful?\"\"Not so far.\" Velin shook her head with a small frown. \"When we entered the labyrinth, they both activated, but we don't understand them.\"\"Uh, actually.\" Baxby raised his hand, a lopsided grin plastered across his face. \"I think I figured out what they are.\"\"Wait, are you serious?\" Thorn looked at the old man incredulously.\"Yeah, as I was drawing out the map, I had a thought. Can I see them?\"\"Of course.\" Velin quickly contacted Jorge, asking him to bring the Dwarven earth maps over to the central tent. A few minutes later the dwarf walked out of the shadows cast by a fold from the back of the tent.\"Hey, Thorn, glad you could join us. Maybe we'll finally make some progress.\" Jorge nodded at the Titan. Pulling out the two spheres from his inventory, the dwarf set them carefully on the table, balanced on their spindly legs. Muttering an arcane phrase, Jorge tapped the top of the spheres, causing a light to burst out of them.The strange carved lines on the spheres lit up, casting peculiar shadows on the table. Each sphere emitted two different colored types of light. Still wearing his lopsided grin, Baxby grabbed the sphere that projected a soft red and light blue light on the table and began to slide it back and forth on the edge of the table.\"You can take the other one off.\" Baxby gestured with his chin at the other Dwarven earth map that was projecting yellow and green light. Curious at what the treasure hunter was doing, Thorn picked up the other Dwarven earth map and tapped it. When nothing happened, he looked at Jorge, who smirked and showed him how to turn it off. Next to the table, Baxby was still working, so Thorn chatted quietly with the others until the old man suddenly cackled with delight.\"Haha, look at that! I knew it.\"Looking at the table, it took Thorn a moment to realize what Baxby was so excited about, but when he did, his eyes widened in surprise. \"No way.\" Jorge could not believe it either.By placing the Dwarven earth map at the right spot along the edge of the table, Baxby cast the soft red light over the map that he had drawn, the twisting lines of light projected by the Dwarven earth map matching his drawing perfectly. \"No way.\" Jorge shook his head. \"It can't be that easy.\"\"Hey, when you've seen what I've seen, nothing surprises you anymore. You youngsters are too rigid in your thinking. This is a fantasy world, kids. What can't happen?\"\"How in the world did you notice that?\" Thorn was dumbfounded that Baxby had picked up clues from seeing the Dwarven earth maps for only a few days.\"Rule number five of treasure hunting, kid. Patterns matter. I noticed that the lines of light from this little trinket were the same as some of the spots I was drawing.\"\"It is not complete.\" Velin's words were like a bucket of cold water, dousing the growing excitement in the tent.\"Sure.\" Baxby rolled his eyes. \"We've got half a map. I'm guessing that the blue side of this map is the water area next to us. We're next to water and air, so there should be another earth map with fire and air to match this one.\"\"So we just need to find out who has that other map and snag it, right?\" Jorge's fingers lightly touched the pommel of his curved dagger. \"Maybe we can trade the map we do not need,\" Velin added, writing furiously in her notebook.\"Can someone explain what you mean by 'next to water and air'? I have no idea where this conversation went.\" Thorn was completely lost.\"Oh, yes. My apologies.\" Velin finished her note and flipped through her notebook. \"The dungeon we are in is called Rakkam, or the Labyrinth City. It is a giant, circular city comprised of five sections, arranged next to each other, like the spokes of a wheel. The center of the city is where the final boss resides. Each section of the city is based on a different element. Starting from our section and going clockwise, we have fire, wind, void, earth, and water. The fire section is sandwiched between the water section on the right and the wind section on the left.\"The sections are largely isolated, though there are spots that seem like they could be used to cross into another section. We have yet to try, as we are focusing on clearing this section. Additionally, we have no idea if we are going to need to clear each section. At this point, I don't think so, as the entrances to each section are located in different places. More likely, we are racing to complete our section before anyone else completes theirs. That said, the dungeons are instanced, so our progress does not affect anyone else's progress.\" \"Got it, thanks, Velin,\" Thorn breathed out, excitement growing in his chest. \"That means that, if we can get the other half of the earth map for the fire section, we'll have a huge advantage.\"\"Correct.\" Velin nodded, her eyes sparkling. \"In all previous World Quests, the dungeons became a permanent fixture, so it is highly likely that this dungeon will remain accessible after the World Quest is finished. If we can finish it first, we'll be able to maximize the benefits while still being able to explore the dungeon fully at a later date.\"\"Alright, I'll contact Corvo to see if he can dig up some information on who has the other half of the fire map. Jorge and Velin, can you see if any of your contacts in Ragnarok have any clues?\" Thorn turned his head toward Baxby, who held up his hands.\"Don't look at me, kid. The Drifters work on a strict code of confidentiality. It's rule seven. Treasure that everyone knows about is no longer treasure.\" A sly grin crossed the old man's face. \"But if I hear any rumblings, I'll let you know.\"\"Thank you.\" Thorn turned back to Velin. \"I'd love to check out the dungeon. I could use the chance to blow off some steam, and I'm excited to get started. What does the schedule look like?\"\"The Titan squad will be entering the dungeon in about two hours. The Deimos squad is currently in the dungeon, but they should be out any minute. Our rotation is every eight hours, though most groups are having trouble staying in the dungeon for more than six, due to the heat. According to our estimates, six hours should be sufficient to cross the dungeon to the heart of the labyrinth once we have mapped the route.\"Once they come out, they'll share what they have learned, and the next group will study the map. Now that we have half of the fire map, our progress should speed up considerably. If we can get the second half of the fire map, we'll be able to bypass the majority of the labyrinth.\"\"Excellent.\" Thorn got the boulder he used as a chair out of his inventory and sat down. \"I'll join the Titan squad for the next run.\" \"Alright.\" Velin nodded as she made a note in her notebook. \"You can join the debriefing when the Deimos squad gets out of the dungeon. Having you join the Titan squad will work well, as there are a couple spots with a high concentration of fire elementals that we have skipped. Now that you are here, why don't we plan on clearing them out?\"\"That suits me just fine.\" A big smile spread across Thorn's face.As they chatted, the flap of the tent opened, and one of the guild members stepped in. Pausing for half a second when he saw Thorn, the player stepped forward and saluted the seated Titan. \"Hey, boss, glad to see you made it back.\"\"Thanks.\" Thorn shot a glance at Velin, who stepped forward smoothly and spoke.\"Welcome back, Sivir. Thorn, Sivir is the leader of the Deimos squad. How was the run?\" The Elven War Priestess gestured for Sivir to come to the table where Baxby was still working on the map.\"It was good.\" Joining the others by the table, Sivir pulled a piece of parchment out of his inventory and handed it to Baxby. \"We tried to be as comprehensive as possible, so the map should be really clear.\"\"This is great.\" Baxby nodded approvingly as he ran his eyes over the map that Sivir produced. With a practiced hand, he began to transfer the lines onto the large map on the table.\"Velin, don't let me forget. We need to talk about taking over the fortress at some point.\" Remembering what he wanted to talk to Velin about, Thorn looked over at her. \"With the mineral veins you discovered and the entrance to the labyrinth, we can't afford to let Ragnarok keep it. This means that we are going to have to figure out a way to kick them out. I'd like to do it without a fight, and without paying a fortune. Though I realize that might be a lot to ask.\"\"That will be difficult.\" Velin tucked her hair behind her ear, frowning slightly. \"Let me think on it.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

Sorry about that.------------------------------\"Thorn is going to be joining you for the next run.\" Standing outside the large tent in the middle of their camp, Velin spoke to Mina, Jorge, Seven Twisted Leaves, and Delmore. \"This is his first time in the dungeon, so make sure you remind him of everything he needs to know.\"\"Don't worry, we'll take care of the noob. Haha.\" Mina was delighted to have Thorn back and poked his thigh with her elbow. Ignoring the Ice Witch, Velin looked at the Fae Druid.\"Leaves, please focus this run on clearing the large rooms of elementals that we have not been able to touch so far. We need to find out if those rooms contain anything important.\"\"Yes, ma'am.\" The Fae saluted and then patted his Tigerkin partner on the shoulder. \"Hear that, Delmore? We won't have to run this time.\"\"Hey, as long as I don't have to get my fur singed again, I'm good.\"\"Let's get a move on.\" Jorge was gruff as always, but under his abrupt tone, Thorn could hear the Shadow Assassin's excitement.\"Right you are, shorty. Titan squad. Form up!\" Seven Twisted Leaves shouted the last few words, his voice carrying easily over the camp. Within a few moments, the fifty members of the Titan squad had gathered, standing in neat rows before the large tent. Thorn could see the quality of the players from the practiced way that they assembled. Running his gaze over the group, the Fae Druid nodded to himself and turned to the Titan.\"Anything you want to say to the squad, boss?\"\"Sure.\" Thorn took an easy step forward, towering over the group. Speaking in his slow, calm voice, Thorn examined the players in front of him. \"Thank you for all your hard work while I was away. Please bear with me as I get up to speed on this dungeon but expect that we will be working hard going forward. I enjoyed getting to fight alongside of you when we assaulted the fortress, and I'm looking forward to more of that as we conquer this dungeon. Leaves will continue to act as the team leader for this run, so give him your best.\"\"Titan squad, move out.\" Not wasting any time, Leaves commanded the group to follow him as he began to jog forward. To get into the dungeon, the team had to go through the fortress to the large gate set in the back wall. As the group traveled, Thorn could see a few players from Ragnarok keeping watch at the gate of the underground fortress, the portcullis that Thorn had bent and twisted hovering above their heads. Mina, sitting comfortably on Thorn's shoulder, saw where he was looking and chuckled.\"Ragnarok still has control over this fortress, but they have not had the time to fix it up. Half of the buildings are falling over, and the rest you smashed into the ground. It'll cost them a fortune to fix the fortress up, and who knows if it will be worth it. Haha, you should have heard them complaining about it once they assessed the damage.\"\"Why wouldn't it be worth it? I thought that the dungeon will become a standard dungeon once the World Quest is over. Wouldn't that mean that whoever controls the fortress controls the entrance to the dungeon?\"\"Oh, sure, but there is no guarantee that it will be worth having control of. Plus, what if the end of the World Quest changes the dungeon into something worthless? Also, it is not like this is the only entrance. You can totally go from one section to the section nearby, so even if Ragnarok blocks off this entrance, you can access this section from the air and water sections.\"\"Got it, that makes sense. So taking over the fortress was a gamble.\"\"Yup. Since they own the fortress, it is on Ragnarok to pay for upkeep and do the repairs.\" Taking off her pointy witch's hat, Mina fixed her long, red hair. \"Boy, am I glad you're back. We've been having a heck of a time with these fire elementals.\"\"What is so difficult about them?\"\"They're just annoying, is all. Especially when they are in large groups. Their special ability is that they regenerate health based on how hot their environment is. So a fire elemental in a fire regenerates faster than a troll.\"\"How fast does a troll regenerate?\" Thorn interrupted before Mina could continue.\"What a noob,\" Mina muttered, rolling her eyes. \"Really fast.\"\"Ten percent of their health per second.\" Jorge's voice drifted up from near Thorn's knees. \"A fully grown troll can go from almost dead to full health in ten seconds. The only way to kill it is to deal high burst damage, DoT it until its regen can't keep up, or use fire attacks, which deal unhealable damage to trolls.\"\"DoT?\"\"Damage over time.\" This time it was Delmore who joined the conversation. \"An effect that deals continuous damage for a specific period of time. Most of my curses are DoT effects.\"\"As I was saying, the fire elementals only have that strong of a regen when they are standing in a fire. However, their bodies are made of fire, so they naturally increase the ambient temperature around them. This means that when they pack together, the area around them gets really hot, almost as hot as standing in a fire. It is like fighting a whole army of trolls.\"\"That sounds frustrating. Can't you just kill them one at a time? Wouldn't that reduce the effective regen of all of them?\"\"Sure, but that requires serious burst damage. Fire elementals are weak to earth-based attacks and physical damage. Unfortunately, there are not many high damage earth-based abilities, as earth focuses mainly on defense. My ice spells are at a disadvantage in this environment.\"\"Ah.\" Realizing why Mina was excited that he had arrived, Thorn chuckled. \"So you are relying on me to smash them.\"\"Exactly.\" Mina beamed. \"With you here, we can squash them all, since you have abnormally high resistances.\"By this time, the group had passed through the gates of the fortress and were walking down the ruined streets. The fortress was in exactly the same shape as it had been when Thorn left. The trails of destruction caused by the giant stone statues reminded Thorn of the pictures of old bombed out buildings in his history books.Approaching the gate to the dungeon, Thorn could feel Mina tensing slightly. A quick glance at the rest of the Titan squad showed that everyone else was on guard, as well. Unsure why everyone was getting ready for a fight, Thorn poked Mina.\"What is going on?\" he whispered, as quietly as he could.\"Those jerks from Ragnarok have been giving us a bit of trouble every time we come,\" Mina said quietly, all traces of her normal joking gone. Thorn had only ever seen her like this in the middle of fights, so he could only assume that the guards from Ragnarok normally gave them more than a little bit of trouble.The large set of doors that led into the dungeon were open, and through them Thorn could see what looked like a forge. A massive furnace spat glowing sparks from its mouth on the right side of the room. Next to it, a complicated bellows system that looked like it could be operated by a dwarf covered the entire wall. The center of the room was dominated by a large anvil made of refined iron, a half finished sword leaning against it.In front of the gate a crowd of players was being held back by a squad of one hundred guards from Ragnarok. Decked out in black and silver armor, Thorn could see that each had a modified version of the Silver Guard symbol on their chests. Without needing to be prompted, Leaves pointed to them and spoke in a low voice.\"Those are the Silver Squires. They are one of the Silver Guard's subordinate groups. They are made up of players trying to get into the Silver Guard. Every time we come, they get in our way. They have been causing trouble for Aurum, as well, so it isn't just us.\" Even though Seven Twisted Leaves was the leader of the Titan squad for the time being, he still looked at Thorn to see how the situation should be handled. \"Just proceed as normal,\" Thorn said in a low voice, his eyes fixed on the guards.\"Got it.\" Leaves nodded. \"Titan squad, follow me.\"The crowd of players milling about at the entrance to the dungeon moved aside as the Titan squad walked up to the gate. Even though each player had their own equipment, the way they walked together marked them as a professional squad. Thorn was especially eye-catching as he stood at least a foot taller than everyone else. \"Hold. What do you think you are doing?\" One of the Silver Squires stepped out to stop Leaves, a deep scar on the guard's mouth twisting his face into a permanent scowl.\"Give it a rest, Yaim.\" Leaves did not back down in the slightest. \"We have free access, so get out of the way.\"\"Nah, not any more.\" Yaim's tone was gleeful. \"The rules have been changed. Everyone who goes in has to pay now. This is Ragnarok's entrance, and if you want to use it, you are going to have to pay up. If you don't have the money, then go collect some. No amount of begging will get you through these gates today.\"\"That was not part of the agreement.\" Mina, unable to tolerate Yaim's words, blinked forward, her wand drawn.The Silver Squire's face paled slightly at the sight of the Ice Witch, but he hardened his resolve when he thought about the fact that the guards from Ragnarok outnumbered the team from Nova Luna. \"Back up, Mina. There is no room for a traitor like you in this discussion.\" Yaim rested his hand on his sword as he stepped forward. \"The adults are talking.\"His eyes narrowing, Leaves rested his hand on Mina's shoulder to keep her from ramming an icicle down Yaim's throat. A quick glance around revealed that the other players gathered at the gate were watching with anticipation, obviously already aware of the change in the rules.\"The rules for entering the dungeon were settled between Sylith and Velin. If there is going to be a change, don't you think you should consult them?\"Laughing scornfully, Yaim pointed his finger in Leaves' face. \"I don't make the rules, I just enforce them. If you want to get through the gate, you better pay up.\"\"If Ragnarok is breaking the agreement, that means we can just wipe them all out and take over the dungeon, right?\" Jorge nudged Thorn in the leg, his gravelly voice immediately ratcheting up the tension. The Titan squad players drew their weapons and readied their spells, immediately entering their combat ready mode. Standing in front of the gate to the dungeon, the players from Ragnarok were taken off guard and were a few beats slower.The two groups stared at each other warily. Thorn just stood quietly behind Leaves and Mina, a small frown on his face. Absorbed in his thoughts, he paid no attention to the weapons aimed at him by the Silver Squires. He could not figure out why it benefited Ragnarok to break the agreement for a little bit of profit. Unless, of course, they had made significant progress in the dungeon and were trying to slow down the other guilds. Sending a quick message to Velin, Thorn's attention returned to the standoff in front of him. \"If you don't want this situation to devolve completely, you better back off.\" Leaves' face was hard to read, but his tone was even and unhurried. \"I'm happy to let Lady Velin know that she needs to talk to your boss, but we are going to go into the dungeon one way or another. You can either move out of the way, or we'll wipe you out as a warmup.\"As if their minds were connected, the entire fifty person group from Nova Luna took a step forward as Leaves spoke his last word, causing the pressure to instantly intensify. Even though they had more players, the Silver Squires began to look at each other nervously. Faced with an elite team of players, they were not confident that they would be able to survive the fight, let alone block them from going into the dungeon.\"Ha, if you want to dig a hole for yourself, be my guest.\" Taking a small step back, Yaim spat on the ground. \"I'm sure that someone from Ragnarok will be calling Velin. Don't blame me when you get in trouble for not following the rules.\"\"No problem.\" Leaves waved him off curtly. \"I'm sure Lady Velin will be interested in talking to your boss about why you are blocking us. Let's go.\"Leading the way forward, Leaves walked past Yaim without another word, bringing the group into the dungeon. As he stepped in, Thorn glanced backward and was surprised to see that there was no sign of the entrance. Instead, a blank stone wall met his gaze. Seeing his surprise, Mina giggled.\"The only way to get out is by finding an exit or by using the token that the party leader gets when we enter.\"\"Huh, interesting. Always learning something new.\" Thorn's eyes lit up. The longer he played Nova Terra and the more he learned, the more excited he got. The game was full of surprises and new things. Just then, Leaves walked up to Thorn, holding a red token in his hand.\"Hey, boss. You want to take over from here?\"\"No way.\" Thorn shook his head as he got out his tetsubo. \"You are doing a fantastic job leading so far, so I'll just follow along. Feel free to command me like I am a regular player. Velin put you in charge, and this is my first time here, so I'm relying on you to show me how to do this.\"\"Sounds good.\" Readying his own weapons, Leaves turned to the rest of the group. \"Alright, this run is going to be standard, except we have added another off tank. Boss, I'll explain what you should do as we go. Our plan is to take down the three big groups of fire elementals that we have not been able to clear in past runs to see if there is anything important in those rooms. Remember to watch your heat. If you get too hot, talk to Mina. Everyone ready? Good, let's go.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone! Are you interested in reading the rest of Book #3?

Sorry about that.------------------------------Sweat dripped from Thorn's forehead, cutting a streak through the ash on his face as it ran down his temple to his cheek. The air was stifling, the heat burning Thorn's lungs, causing his breath to catch in his chest. It had not even been twenty minutes, and he was already dirty from the swirling ash and drenched in sweat underneath his armor. In the lower periphery of his vision, Thorn could see new notifications blinking past at regular intervals. Chuckling quietly to himself, Thorn dismissed the notifications and followed Leaves as he led the way forward. Jorge and nine other players had left to scout ahead while the rest of the Titan squad followed behind. The beginning area had been fully mapped, allowing Leaves to lead them around the traps while the scouts dealt with the small groups of enemies roaming nearby. As they walked, Thorn examined the labyrinth city. Made entirely of stone, the hallways were broad, reminding Thorn of the wide streets in the empire's floating capital. Massive pillars covered in intricate carvings stretched almost forty feet in the air, holding up the curved ceiling. The labyrinth gave the impression that it was better suited to giants than dwarves. Even the furnaces and forging tools looked like they were built on a larger than normal scale.Pushing his curiosity to the back of his mind as they entered a large hallway, Thorn focused his attention on the fire elementals milling about. Around five feet tall, the fire elementals floated almost a foot off the ground. Roughly humanoid in shape, they were composed of an orange flame with a purplish-blue core. There were twenty-five fire elementals floating in the hallway, drifting back and forth in a seemingly random pattern.\"Watch closely,\" Mina said, pointing her wand at one of the fire elementals floating near the edge of the group. \"As that guy gets closer to the others, the temperature goes up. You can tell how warm it is by the color of the core.\"The fire elemental paused and then turned, drifting back toward the center of the group. As it moved, its core underwent a subtle change. The purplish-blue core slowly lost its purplish tint, becoming a deeper blue. \"Once it goes from purple to blue,\" Leaves explained, pointing at the fire elemental who was slowly heating up, \"they are at their highest state of regeneration. Plus, the heat is going to deal damage to whomever they clump around. So far our tactic has been luring a couple out at a time, but with these large groups, that is almost impossible. Twenty-five is still manageable, but when we get up to the groups of seventy-five to one hundred, we get burned alive before we can get them down to a reasonable number.\"Boss, we're going to try something new this time. Rather than try and draw a couple of the fire elementals over, we're going to stack you with defensive spells and send you into the middle of the group. Melee fighters will peel off enemies from the outside while our ranged DPS will focus on downing elementals near you. Tanks will protect the healers, who will focus 100 percent on you.\"\"Sure, sounds good.\" Grinning with anticipation, Thorn buckled on his helmet and hoisted his tetsubo. \"Just say the word.\"\"Okay, healers, I want all buffs on Thorn on the count of ten. Follow them up with as much healing as you have. Better to overheal during this first run than underheal. DPS, get ready to burst the elementals down as fast as possible. Alright, are we ready? Thorn, charge on two. Ready. Ten, nine...\" As Leaves began the countdown, the healers stepped forward, waiting until it was time to begin casting their buffs. They started their chants when the count reached the right number, based on how long it took them to chant the spell, so that they would all finish when Seven Twisted Leaves called out one.\"Seven, six.\"Taking a deep breath, Thorn tightened his grip on his tetsubo as Leaves counted down.\"Four, three.\"Thorn's body dropped into a crouch.\"Two.\"\"[Shadow Dash]!\" Charging forward, Thorn's armored form blurred as he shifted in and out of sight. Covering close to fifty feet in a few steps, he drew back his tetsubo as he lowered his shoulder. \"One.\" As Seven Twisted Leaves called out the final number, a deluge of buffs and healing spells fell on Thorn, completely covering him in a golden glow. Damage mitigation enchantments, heal over time spells, force field bubbles, armor strengthening spells, and many other abilities covered Thorn in an instant. Shimmering back into view, Thorn's shoulder smashed into a flame elemental, causing it to burst apart, sending flaming pieces of magma raining down around him. Focused on cutting down the elementals as fast as possible, Thorn unleashed his tetsubo strike, smashing through two fire elementals, sizzling pieces of flaming magma bouncing off of the shields that surrounded him. Spinning, he flicked out his weapon again, crushing two more elementals before they could respond. With roars of rage, the flame elementals turned toward the Titan in their midst. Summoning balls of fire, they began charging toward him, causing the temperature where Thorn was standing to shoot up. Even through the layers of protective buffs and spells, Thorn began to sweat almost immediately.The closer the fire elementals came to Thorn's hulking figure, the hotter he got, and the faster his defensive buffs burned away. Soon, the only thing Thorn could see was a bright red glow as countless fireballs bombarded his shields. *CRACK* The last shield finally broke and a few remaining fireballs broke over his armor, burning his skin. The stinging from the attacks was fierce, but Thorn didn't even blink. Nova Terra managed pain well, keeping it present but at reasonable levels so that players were not afraid of combat. Yet, compared to Thorn's daily life before playing, it was less than an itch. As he felt the sensation from the fireballs, the excitement in Thorn's chest began to burn hotter.Laughing out loud, Thorn began to smash the fire elementals around him with wild abandon, completely releasing the frustrations he had accumulated over the past week. Ignoring his defense, Thorn blew through his enemies like they were paper, sending gouts of magma splashing across the floor with each kill.\"Holy...\" One of the healers who was focusing on keeping Thorn's health up was so shocked by the sight of Thorn's rampage that her mouth fell open. \"I know, right?\" Delmore was standing next to her, casting a regeneration spell at Thorn. \"[Spirit of Life]! He is a total monster.\"\"This should work.\" Seven Twisted Leaves was watching the fight carefully. Less than a minute had passed and, already, half of the fire elementals had been killed. As he looked on, he saw Thorn punch out with his left hand, blowing another elemental into oblivion.As the fire elementals fell, the remaining enemies began to weaken, allowing Thorn to finish them off even faster. The elementals at the edge of the group started to lose their high level regeneration ability as the temperature dropped and began to be picked off by the ranged DPS players. This set up a chain reaction, and within another minute the rest of the fire elementals were destroyed.\"That was awesome!\" Cheering, Mina was about to run forward when Delmore grabbed her shoulder, his whiskers twitching. Confused, Mina followed his pointing finger and gulped, her face paling.Thorn stood in the midst of the flaming carnage, his armor glowing with heat. Surrounding him was the burning magma from the deaths of the fire elementals, so hot that it caused the stone floor to liquefy. Even as he stood there, Thorn's health was dropping rapidly, forcing the healers to be constantly pumping healing spells into him just to keep him alive.With a casual leap, Thorn landed outside the molten circle, his armor popping as it rapidly cooled off. Taking off his helmet, Thorn frowned slightly as his eyes looked over the devastated floor.\"That was really awesome!\" Mina made sure to keep her distance as she summoned some snowflakes to help Thorn cool down faster. \"Do you think you will be able to do the same thing with a larger group?\"Standing nearby, Seven Twisted Leaves held his breath. This was the really important question. Nova Luna had been making good progress overall, but they were getting hung up on the large groups of fire elementals. While those big groups would stop most other guilds, Velin had let it slip that Ragnarok would not be phased by them at all. The Silver Guard were the strongest defensive team in Nova Terra, and even one hundred fire elementals would not be able to burn through their shields.\"It depends how much hotter it gets.\" Thorn scratched his chin as he thought it over. \"If there is an upper limit to how many times the ability stacks, I should be fine. However, if there is no upper limit, it will be really tough.\"\"The ability stacks up to twenty times. At least, that is what we assume.\" Mina sent a stat sheet to Thorn. \"Velin ran a bunch of tests, and this is what she came up with. There seem to be some large fire elementals in the big groups that break that rule, but we don't know if their boost effects all the little guys or if it just counts more of the little guys for their own buffs.\"\"Well, I guess we'll just have to see, huh?\" Buckling his helmet back on, Thorn glanced at Seven Twisted Leaves. \"I'm ready when you are.\"\"Hey, don't forget the loot.\" \"Oh, right. Haha,\" Thorn's voice was sheepish. \"Let me know if you need me to carry something. I still have a lot of room.\"\"And never get it back?\" Mina scoffed. \"No way. We're not putting anything into that bottomless pit of yours.\"\"Hey, I'm not that bad. I remember what I put in my inventory.\"\"Sure, Thorn. Sure you do.\" Thorn could practically hear the eye roll in Mina's words.The fire elementals had a relatively low drop rate, but having killed twenty-five of them, there was still a small pile of loot on the ground. Thorn recognized a few pieces of Fire Iron glowing on the ground next to some shimmering red things that looked like flower petals.\"Oh, sweet, Fire Lotus Petals!\" Seven Twisted Leaves was excited as he picked up the shimmering petals. \"These are useful for all sorts of potions. They make a great fire resistance potion that will be helpful for clearing the later stages of this dungeon.\"Putting the ore and herbal ingredients away, Seven Twisted Leaves picked up a few pieces of gear that had dropped and shared their stats. \"Anyone want to roll for these? If not, they'll go in the guild bank.\"A few players raised their hands after comparing the stats on the items to their current gear and walked to the front of the group. Thorn watched with interest as they each summoned a virtual die, rolling off to see who got the gear. Opening up his armor's stats, Thorn compared it against the set of boots that Seven Twisted Leaves was holding.  There was nothing particularly special about the armor Thorn was wearing when Hati chose him to be an avatar, so Thorn was grateful that the blessing Hati gave was able to be transferred to a better set of armor once he found one. For a moment, the thought of competing with the other players for the Flaming Iron Boots crossed his mind, but he immediately dismissed it. Thorn's transformed armor had gained set-piece properties once it was blessed by Hati, making it better than collecting a hodge-podge set of armor. Unlike Asha's set that he had picked up from Ouroboros, the set bonuses were based on having more of the pieces equipped, making it worth having a full set even though the last two set bonus were unusable as Thorn still had not unlocked the [Wolf Helm] and [Wolf Form] abilities. A slim Elven archer won the roll off for the Flaming Iron Boots, causing Thorn to frown slightly.\"What's up? Why the sour look?\" Mina noticed that Thorn's expression was off.\"Those boots are made for a Dwarf. How are they going to fit an Elf?\"\"Are you serious? Are...\" Mina's mouth hung open, her words failing her. At her side, Jorge started laughing so loudly that the entire squad looked over at him. \"What?\" Realizing that he had just embarrassed himself again, Thorn froze, his face blushing bright red under his helmet. Excited by her new gear, the Elven player equipped the boots, leaving Thorn wide-eyed as the thick, metal soled combat boots changed their shape into a slim-fitting pair of knee high boots with a slight heel. Only the runic symbols along the sides remained the same.With a groan, Thorn dropped his head into his hands. All he could think about was the countless pieces of gear still sitting in his inventory because they were too small for his massive body. He had just assumed that a piece of gear that was sized for a regular person would not fit him, and no one had ever corrected that assumption. Seeing Thorn's shoulders slump, Mina joined Jorge in his laughter, doubling over uncontrollably.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone! Extra special note today!

Are you ready to take on a larger group? Our next target has about seventy-five fire elementals. I know it is a big jump, but we don't have much choice, as there are no groups in between that we've found.\" The Fae Druid walked over to Thorn.\"I'll be fine as long as I'm healed.\" Thorn was grateful for his helmet as his face was still bright red from his earlier embarrassment.\"Good, lets go.\" Gathering up the rest of the Titan squad, Seven Twisted Leaves led them forward down the boulevard-like  hallway. According to the map that Baxby drew, the large groups of fire elementals were guarding three large rooms spread evenly across the dungeon. The treasure hunter had identified the rooms as special but had not been able to do a close examination due to the number of fire elementals present.After fighting their way through a few smaller groups, they arrived in the southeast corner of the dungeon where the first of the large groups was milling about. The large room looked like it had once been a feast hall and was dominated by a large, open fire pit with a massive spit going across it.\"Hey, look at that.\" Jorge popped out of the shadows near Thorn, pointing to a large stone chair set in the wall. \"What about it?\" Mina asked, furrowing her brow when she could not see anything special.\"That chair is Thorn-sized.\"\"So? You know, I'll never understand the Dwarven obsession with building things really big.\" Mina smirked. \"Maybe they are compensating for something.\"\"No, that is what I am trying to say. It is abnormal. There are traces of something or someone Thorn-sized sitting on it for a long time. Look where the seat is worn away. No Dwarf could do that from sitting on it. I swear, you get denser every day.\"\"Hey, what is that supposed to mean?\" Mina was about to start fighting with Jorge, when Thorn held up his hand.\"Focus, you two. We're about to go into combat. You can argue about butt marks later.\" Thorn's tone brooked no argument, and the two short players focused immediately.\"Thorn.\" Seven Twisted Leaves called the Titan forward. \"Do you see those three who are taller than normal? They are elite mobs.\"Looking at the dense sea of fire elementals in front of him, Thorn easily picked out the elite fire elementals. At least two feet taller than the normal fire elementals, the elite fire elementals had a bulkier build as well as weapons made of the same shimmering red flame that made up their bodies. Still unarmored, these fire elementals were vaguely humanoid but much more aggressive looking.\"We need to be especially careful of the elite fire elementals. They have an attack called [Fire Spear] that has significant piercing power and insane damage. If it hits you, you'll be dead, so in order to block it, we will use a bubble. The problem is that with three of them, we won't have enough bubbles to last. The cooldown on [Fire Spear] is too short, and we don't have enough players who can bubble you.\"\"Bubble?\"\"[Globe of Invulnerability], [Shadow Fade], [Holy Shield], things like that. Anything that gives absolute damage reduction and can be cast on another person is called a bubble,\" Jorge helpfully supplied.\"Got it. How long can they block?\"\"Total? We can give any one player eighteen seconds of absolute damage reduction, but on a two hour cooldown. If we space them out and everyone hits their casts perfectly, we can block six [Fire Spear] casts. Unfortunately, the elite fire elementals can cast [Fire Spear] every two minutes. Best case, we can keep them from hitting you for five minutes and fifty-nine seconds. After that, you are on your own.\"\"What if I kill them?\"\"Sure, that lets us stretch it out. If you can take out one before they cast, we can extend it to eight minutes.\"\"Alright.\" Thorn's eyes ran over the mass of fire elementals, carefully judging the spacing between the elite mobs. They were arranged in a rough triangle, around one hundred feet apart from each other, surrounded by a large number of regular fire elementals. \"What is the range of their [Fire Spear] attack?\"\"One hundred and twenty feet or so. It depends how long they charge it.\"\"Hmm. This is going to be rough.\" Thorn tapped his tetsubo on his shoulder as he thought. \"We need to get them clumped up. If we can do that,  then I can just smash them. Otherwise, I am going to be eating multiple spears every time I try and approach one of them.\"\"Just be thankful that they don't kite,\" Seven Twisted Leaves grunted.\"I can get you near two of them.\" Delmore spoke up. \"My ability that lets me swap a spirit with one of my teammates can be used on an enemy with the right conditions. I should be able to drop one of them into melee range while you engage another one. That just leaves the one free.\"\"Maybe we can have the other tanks focus on trying to hold its aggro?\" Seven Twisted Leaves grimaced as he scratched his head. \"We'll have to split the healers and might end up losing some of the tanks, but it is better than nothing.\"\"Pulling one should be good enough.\" Thorn glanced at Delmore. \"If you can pull one of the elite fire elementals over to me, I'll deal with the others.\"\"What? You're going to take all three of them head on? Is that a good idea?\"\"Honestly? I have no idea.\" Thorn chuckled. \"If this works, we should be able to clear them without a problem. At worst, I'll just have to try something else tomorrow. Are we good to give it a try?\"\"Your call, Thorn. I mean, you are the one running to your fiery death.\" Seven Twisted Leaves shrugged.\"Haha, it's true. Just make sure that you stand far enough back that you can run if this fails.\" Resting his tetsubo against his leg, Thorn got his arbalest out of his inventory and loaded up one of the massive bolts. Once it was loaded, he picked his tetsubo back up and looked at Seven Twisted Leaves, a weapon in each hand.\"Leaves, can you pass me the leader position? I need it to use my [Pack Travel] ability.\"\"Sure.\"\"I am going to kill one of the elite fire elementals as fast as I possibly can, and then I'll move to the next. At that point, Delmore, can you send the third elite elemental over to my location?\"\"Yes.\"\"Great. This will largely hinge on me killing the first target almost instantly, so if that doesn't happen or there is a problem, get ready to run.\"\"Good luck.\" The Tigerkin patted Thorn on the shoulder with a furry hand. \"I'm going to cast a spell on you that will let me move a spirit to you, so don't resist.\" Chanting softly, Delmore waved his long-handled dagger around his head and then pointed at Thorn, who was doing his best to remain completely calm. A faintly menacing chill settled on Thorn, making him shiver. Seeing Delmore nod, Thorn checked to make sure everyone else was ready and then made his way toward the group of fire elementals. Taking a deep breath, he calmed himself down, focusing his attention on the closest elite fire elemental. Raising his tetsubo, he pointed.\"This one is my first target. After that, I am going to the right. Delmore, pull the guy on the left.\"\"You got it, boss.\"Taking another deep breath, Thorn gripped his weapons tightly and dropped into a crouch. His eyes began to take on a hint of red as a heavy aura seeped from him.\"[Wolf's Rage].\"Instantly, Thorn's strength and agility shot up, filling his form with power. Not wanting to waste a single moment, Thorn launched himself forward, each step carrying him a dozen feet forward into the midst of the fire elementals. As he rushed forward, Thorn could feel the temperature rising, but he was moving so fast that the first fire elementals he passed did not have the chance to respond.Sprinting toward his target, Thorn completely ignored everything else. Normally, in a fight like this, letting powerful enemies get into his blind spots was a recipe for death, but if he wanted to take the first elite fire elemental down quickly, he had no choice but to ignore the others. Since he had decided to trust the healers to keep him alive, Thorn spared no thought for defense, instead focusing on maximizing his offensive ability.As he got closer to the elite elemental, Thorn could hear the chanting behind him grow louder as the healers readied themselves to block any incoming [Fire Spear] attacks. In front of him, the large shimmering fire elemental threw back its head and roared. Lifting the flaming spear in its hand, it drew back its arm, preparing to throw, and froze. At first, Thorn thought that there was something wrong, but then he noticed the glow around the elite fire elemental's hand growing brighter.Realizing that it was charging the attack, Thorn took two massive steps forward and threw back his head, a powerful wave of sound echoing from him as he howled.\"[Wolf Lord's Howl]!\"The waves of sound buffeted the fire elementals surrounding him, causing them to pause and fall into a stupor. Even the elite fire elemental was shaken, causing its hand to drop back to its side. Yet the stunned state did not hold it for long, and after a second, its hand rose again. Still, that second allowed Thorn to take two more steps forward, getting close to his striking distance.Drawing back his tetsubo for an overhead attack, Thorn felt the air grow blistering as two fiery spears entered his vision. Shooting through the air toward his chest, Thorn knew that if he continued moving forward, they would hit him, yet all he did was grit his teeth and push forward. Determined to hit his target, Thorn could only trust his defense to his teammates behind him.The spears came closer, allowing Thorn to see the swirling flame that surrounded a burning blue core. The spears made a snapping sound as they traveled, the spiral flame on the outside devouring the air it passed through. Still, Thorn did not flinch, only tightening his grip on his tetsubo as he brought it over his head in a large arc.Just as the first of the two [Fire Spears] was about to impact on his chest, a brilliant glow bloomed around him, covering his body from head to toe in a deep earthen yellow. The yellow energy started at his feet and flowed up his body, getting to his chest just in time to block the first [Fire Spear]. The swirling rod of flame hit the shield, causing it to ripple violently. Despite looking like it was about to shatter, the yellow shield held fast. Pushing forward, Thorn's strike had just begun to fall when the second [Fire Spear] stabbed into the shield. This time, Thorn felt the shield crack where the [Fire Spear] landed, and the tip of the spear nearly touched his armor. The heat from the spear instantly boiled the air around Thorn, beginning to heat up his armor. Without sparing a thought for the [Fire Spear] that had almost skewered him, Thorn smashed his weapon onto the head of the elite fire elemental in front of him.*BOOM*With a thunderous sound, the metal weapon ripped through the body of the elite fire elemental, crushing it to the ground. Burning magma splashed onto the stone floor, turning the area around the beaten down fire elemental into a burning hell. Ignoring the flames, Thorn jabbed down with his loaded arbalest, the tip of the siege crossbow coming to rest a few inches from the elite fire elemental's head.*TWANG**CRACK*The sound of the massive bolt shooting through the elemental's head and burying itself in the stone floor echoed from the pillared walls. Without waiting to see if having the majority of its head liquified had killed it, Thorn angled his body to the right, and not pausing for even a moment, Thorn threw back his head.\"[Rallying Cry]!\" As the ability activated, Thorn could feel his injuries lightening as his natural health regen and his stamina increased. As soon as the buff took effect, [Pack Travel] kicked in, granting the whole team a boost to their speed. Thorn pushed off the ground powerfully as he activated his charge ability.\"[Shadow Dash]!\"As his form flickered and he shot forward, Thorn could feel the healer's spells repairing the burning damage he took from stepping into the magma left behind by the elite fire elemental. As the pain in his feet eased, Thorn continued to dash forward, dodging through the crowd of fire elementals as best he could.For every elemental that his ability allowed him to bypass, he crushed another, leaving a trail of burning stone as the magma they released when they died splattered across the floor. Gritting his teeth under his helmet, Thorn pushed himself to move as fast as he possibly could, trying not to let the mass of elementals slow him down.Thanks to his [Rallying Cry] ability, [Pack Travel]'s 50% speed increase was able to be applied in combat, and combined with [Wolf's Rage] he was moving at lightning speed. Unfortunately, Thorn could feel the buff from [Rallying Cry] starting to fade, heralding the end of his speed buff from [Pack Travel]. He had only traveled half the distance to the next elite fire elemental when his speed began to drop and the [Evasive] condition from his [Shadow Dash] ended. His mind whirling furiously, Thorn realized that he did not have much choice but to try and muscle through. Grinning to himself, Thorn began to wield his tetsubo, striking out in sweeping arcs to clear the path in front of him. Focusing on moving the fire elementals away instead of killing them in one blow, Thorn pushed his way forward until he was only twenty feet away from his target, when a chill traveled down his spine.Looking over the heads of the fire elementals in front of him, he spotted the elite fire emental's raised arm, a growing glow surrounding its lifted [Fire Spear].-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

Remembering the last two that nearly skewered him, Thorn couldn't help but gulp. He had no confidence that his armor, as strong as it was, would protect him against the [Fire Spear].Still, all he could do at this point was trust that the healers at his back would keep him alive. Forcefully pushing any thoughts about the incoming attacks out of his mind, Thorn focused on crossing the last twenty feet as fast as possible. The brilliant glow surrounding the closest elite fire elemental's [Fire Spear] flickered, and its arm began to launch the weapon. At the same instant, a pearlescent orb of arcane energy popped into existence around Thorn.*CRACK*As soon as the [Globe of Invulnerability] appeared, it shattered into a million pieces as the fully charged [Fire Spear] smashed into it. \"Oh no!\" The Arcane Mage who had just cast the [Globe of Invulnerability] was horrified to see the [Fire Spear] obliterate it instantly. Still, as a professional player, she knew exactly what had happened. The elite fire elemental had released a fully charged [Fire Spear], just like last time. The difference was that this time Thorn was much closer. The charged [Fire Spear] had no time to lose its momentum, instead hitting at full power.\"Got it!\" The next guild member who was in line to cast a bubble was a Shadow Priest. He had been watching closely for any sign of an issue and reacted immediately. With another [Fire Spear] about to arrive, there was no time to cast his bubble spell normally and instead, the Shadow Priest swung his staff at the ground, shattering the black gem attached to the end.With the next [Fire Spear] so close that he could reach out and touch it, Thorn felt his body become illusory again, like when he activated his [Shadow Dash]. This time, though, Thorn could tell that he had completely transformed into a spectre, unable to interact with the real world at all. Seizing his chance, Thorn continued to sprint forward, passing directly through the fire elementals between him and the elite fire elemental. At the same time, the [Fire Spear] shot through his body, causing no damage as his form rippled, and impacted the ground on the other side. The attack dug into the stone, leaving a trail of molten stone as it landed, before exploding in a massive gout of flame and magma.The Arcane Mage whose [Globe of Invulnerability] had been destroyed swallowed and looked thankfully at the Shadow Priest who had saved Thorn. It was her turn to block the spells, but no one had anticipated the [Fire Spear] being that strong at close range. Due to the Shadow Priest's quick thinking and his willingness to sacrifice his weapon, the fight had not fallen apart.Seven Twisted Leaves was not nearly as relieved, however. By using his bubble, the Shadow Priest had saved Thorn but, at the same time, shortened the time they could keep Thorn alive. Originally, they had determined that they could keep Thorn bubbled against four waves of attacks if he was able to take out one elite fire elemental before it cast [Fire Spear], which he had done. However, with the Arcane Mage and the Shadow Priest doubling up against one attack, they were going to be hard pressed to deal with the next attack. The only hope was for Thorn to deal with two elite fire elementals in melee within two minutes. Still, there was not much choice except to try.\"Delmore!\" Seven Twisted Leaves shouted for his partner to be ready.\"Chill, I got it.\" The Tigerkin Spirit Guide waved his long handled dagger in the air, leaving a bizarre purplish-black line in the air wherever his dagger passed. As the symbol was completed, he spun around twice, chanting in a strange voice that seemed both high and low pitched at the same time. The symbol in the air pulsed twice, the purplish-black lines growing stronger until they threatened to tear the air itself apart. As if they shared the same mind, all of the members of the Titan squad nearby took a step backwards, sensing the danger of the floating symbol. \"What a creep,\" Seven Twisted Leaves mumbled, not missing the chance to mock his friend regardless of the seriousness of the situation.\"Yeah, effective though,\" Mina said from the side. \"[Greater Spirit Transfer]!\"As they watched, the symbol flashed out of sight, re-appearing directly between Thorn and the furthest elite fire elemental. Growing until it was almost twenty feet across, it pulsed again, causing two smaller copies of the symbol to appear next to Thorn and the elite fire elemental. Purple tentacles abruptly burst out of the smaller symbol next to the elite elemental. Wrapping around it, the tentacles ignored the burning flames covering the elemental's body. The elite fire elemental, not about to go without a fight, began to glow, its core rapidly turning from a deep blue to a sky blue as its temperature rose exponentially. The raging flames that surrounded the elemental burned the purple tentacles, charring them into black stubs in no time. Regenerating rapidly, the purple tentacles attacked again, only to be burnt away.Growling, Delmore waved his dagger in the air in front of him. The blade of the dagger seemed to vanish from sight as he thrust it forward. At the same moment, from the center of the floating symbol next to the elite fire elemental, a spectral blade stabbed out, cutting through the flames surrounding the elemental. Freed from the brunt of the heat, the purple tentacles regenerated and lashed out, wrapping around the elite fire elemental's burning figure.Seeing that the tentacles had reached their target, Delmore spat another strange sounding phrase, and the tentacles abruptly withdrew into the floating symbol, bringing the struggling fiery figure with them. Sensing that the tentacles, which were still being burned, would not last long enough to get the elite fire elemental to the symbol, Delmore resolutely slashed his palm, splashing blood into the air in front of him.Under Mina's creeped out gaze, the blood appeared to land on something. As it dripped toward the ground, Mina could barely make out a large skull with purple tentacles writhing where its jaw should have been like a creepy octopus. The blood dripping over the skull and its waving tentacles disappeared, absorbed by the spectral figure, causing it to vanish into the void as if it had never existed.\"I take it back. A total creep.\" Mina turned toward Seven Twisted Leaves. Whatever she had partially seen just then was enough to give anyone nightmares for weeks. \"I told you.\" The Fae Druid shuddered. \"And that is not even the worst of it. Sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and starts doing his weird dance. You should see some of the 'friends' that come to visit.\"Shooting his friends a dirty look, Delmore ignored them and concentrated on powering the floating symbol and its purple tentacles to draw in the elite fire elemental. The symbol pulsed again, a blood red color seeping out of the lines and dripping onto the purple tentacles. As the blood rolled down them, a bright red line surfaced, running down the center of each tentacle. The red lines shook, sending out tiny blood-red tendrils like a system of veins, causing the tentacles to grow and strengthen.Regenerating even faster than before, they wrapped around the elite fire elemental, completely impervious to the shimmering fire that covered it. With a massive tug, the elite fire elemental was pulled into the symbol.Next to Thorn, the other floating symbol pulsed and the purple tentacles burst out, dropping the elite fire elemental to the ground before retreating as fast as they could. As soon as the purple tentacles disappeared, the purplish-black symbol began to twist. The two small floating symbols were sucked back into the large, twenty-foot wide symbol where they merged together in the center. The pulsing lines of the spell glowed brightly for a moment, getting thinner and thinner as they burned out. Just before the lines completely vanished, they collapsed into each other, sending out a shockwave that knocked the surrounding fire elementals away. His spell ending with a bang, Delmore shivered and dropped to the ground, his whiskers trembling. The whole spell, from beginning to end, had only lasted a few seconds, but the intensity of the struggle had drained Delmore of all his energy, leaving him gulping in big breaths of air.\"Are you okay?\" Seven Twisted Leaves asked his friend, concern evident in his voice.\"Yeah,\" the Tigerkin gasped, waving a hand feebly. \"I'll be fine. That contract just takes a lot out of me.\"\"[Healing Seed].\" Casting a healing spell on the Spirit Guide, Seven Twisted Leaves turned his eyes back to Thorn, who was now fighting in melee with the two large fire elementals. \"How long will you need to recover?\"I'm going to be useless for the next day, probably.\"\"Alright, rest up.\"\"Do you think we should go help him?\" Mina asked, pointing her wand toward the furious fight between Thorn and the two elite fire elementals.\"Do you think any of us could survive in there?\"Seeing the waves of heat radiating off of the elite fire elementals and the brightening glow as Thorn's armor heated up, Mina bit her lip in frustration. So far, only Thorn's abnormal resistance could stand up to the sheer heat of the elite fire elementals. Still, Mina was determined to help. Summoning her glowing ice orbs, she spoke to the Dwarf at her side.\"Jorge, get ready to pull me out.\"\"Wait, what?\" Startled, Jorge looked over just in time to see Mina slide forward. Reaching out to stop her, Jorge groaned and dropped his face into his palm. \"Get ready to heal us,\" he snapped toward Seven Twisted Leaves before chasing after Mina.The Ice Witch skated forward on a trail of ice that appeared beneath her feet. As she got closer to the great mass of fire elementals, the air grew hotter, causing her ice trail to have trouble forming. As it was beginning to melt, Mina raised her wand and chanted to herself.\"[Ice Wall]!\" A massive block of ice shot up under her feet, sending her flying forty feet into the air. Combined with her forward speed, Mina flew over the fire elementals. With absolute focus, she pointed, directing her orbs to hover underneath her feet like a set of stairs. As her foot landed on the first orb, it showed signs of cracking, holding together just long enough for her to push off, leaping through the air to the next orb.The three orbs allowed Mina to gain more height, and a quick [Blink] got her into position over Thorn and the two elite fire elementals. As she started to fall down toward them, Mina could feel the rising heat beginning to singe her hair. Her skin flushed red almost instantly, as if she had been outside in the sun all day. A spike of fear stabbed through her as she saw the glow beneath her feet growing, and for a moment she regretted jumping out. Dropping into the fight between Thorn and the elite fire elementals was like diving into a pool of lava. Shaking off the paralyzing feeling, Mina began to cast her spells as fast as she could.\"[Sub Zero]! [Infinite Ice Spikes]! [Avalanche]! [Raging Blizzard]!\" Anything that could lower the temperature of the inferno below her was thrown down at the fight, regardless of who was standing underneath her. The hastily formed ice spells didn't last more than a few seconds in the face of the elite fire elemental's heat, but the arcane chill that they brought with them drastically cooled the surrounding air. The drop in temperature gave Thorn, whose armor had become bright orange, a chance to breathe. The ton of ice from Mina's [Avalanche] spell turned into rain before it hit the ground, but the sudden increase in humidity sucked much of the heat from Thorn's armor, granting him respite from the constant burning.The healing spells from the Titan squad healers had never stopped, but due to the intense environmental effect that the elite fire elementals carried with them, Thorn's health had slowly been decreasing as the healing spells failed to keep up with how much damage he was taking. Mina's rain allowed Thorn's health to shoot back up, buying him more time.At the same time, the two elite fire elementals noticed that their heat was being suppressed, causing them to roar in rage. Furious at this new attacker's interference, they abruptly changed targets. As if they were the same creature, they lifted their hands and summoned their [Fire Spear] attacks, aiming directly at the falling Ice Witch.Mina, her vision obscured by the huge cloud of steam caused by the evaporating water, had no idea that the two elite fire elementals had locked onto her. She was not alone, however, and seeing their attention swing away from him, Thorn took the chance to go on the offensive. Gripping his tetsubo with two hands, he brought it down over his head in an arc, the jagged end ripping through the shoulder of one of the elite fire elementals. The blow landed, crushing the fire elemental's shoulder and arm, sending it tumbling to the ground, the [Fire Spear] it was charging falling to the ground where it burned the stone. Not bothering to finish it off, Thorn used the momentum of his strike to rotate his body and lunge forward, his weapon striking down at the other elite fire elemental. As if sensing the incoming blow, the elite fire elemental's arm jerked forward, releasing the [Fire Spear] before it was fully charged. The [Fire Spear] shot forward, snapping and crackling as the rain that was still falling sizzled away.Less than twenty feet from the ground, Mina was beginning to pick up speed. Gritting her teeth in preparation for the impact, her body was suddenly jerked sideways as Jorge appeared on her left in a puff of shadow. Flying past her back, he hooked an arm around her waist, and together they disappeared in another puff as a [Fire Spear] brushed past, cutting through the air where Mina had just been.\"Ugh. How are you so heavy?\" Jorge complained as he flopped onto the ground, completely spent. His [Shadow Blink]'s cost increased drastically when he brought other people along with him, and using it twice in rapid succession sucked all of his energy right out of him.\"Maybe you're just weak.\" Despite her words, Mina looked at Jorge gratefully, her disheveled red hair sticking to her flushed face. \"Thanks. That was terrifying. I don't think I'll try that again.\"\"You people are insane.\" Seven Twisted Leaves shook his head. Still, inwardly he was somewhat envious. Mina's creative use of her spells was the reason she was considered one of the most dangerous player-versus-player combatants in the game, and her crazy actions just now showed how well she could work outside the box.\"Hey, I'm just the rescuer. Don't lump me in with her.\" Jorge shook his head. \"We can only hope that Ms. Suicide over here bought the boss some time.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

As the heat evaporated the rain, the water drops turned into dense clouds of steam that shrouded Thorn and the elite fire elementals. The first one he had knocked down rose back to its feet with an anguished roar, dripping magma as it floated toward Thorn, who was standing over its companion.Ignoring the incoming elite fire elemental, Thorn focused on destroying the elemental who had just thrown its [Fire Spear] at Mina. The thick steam kept Thorn from seeing if the [Fire Spear] hit, and imagining what might have happened caused Thorn's fury to bubble up. Throwing back his head, he howled in rage, activating both [Wolf Lord's Howl] and [Wolf's Rage] at the same time.Lifting his tetsubo, he brought it down again and again on the elite fire elemental at his feet until it stopped twitching, completely ignoring the burning hot magma splashing on him with each blow. The stabbing pain in his legs and arms as the droplets of flame landed on him simply drove his rage even hotter. Hearing a sound behind him, Thorn turned, his half melted armor creaking and groaning as the fused plates moved. The elite fire elemental that had just shaken off the effect of [Wolf Lord's Howl] paused slightly as it stared at the enraged Titan. Something in its tiny brain was warning it that taking another step forward was a sure path toward oblivion. Unfortunately, the warning came too late. Stepping forward, Thorn smashed out with his tetsubo, completely crushing the elite fire elemental's head. Dashing past it as it fell to the ground, Thorn began to lay waste to the regular fire elementals that had packed around. Without the intense heat generated by the elite fire elementals, the steam prevented the fire elementals from reaching their maximum temperature, allowing Thorn to smash them apart easily.By the time [Wolf's Rage] had ended, Thorn had destroyed the majority of the fire elementals in the cloud. Staggering slightly, he walked out of the dense steam, his armor giving off pops as it cooled down, only to see Seven Twisted Leaves, Mina, Jorge, Delmore, and the rest of the Titan squad staring at him in shock. Looking like they were watching a monster, the whole squad took a step back as he walked forward.\"Thorn? Are you okay?\" Mina asked tentatively, her concerned gaze running over his massive figure.\"Yeah. Why wouldn't I be okay?\" Thorn's voice was husky and dry.\"Um.\" Lost for words, Mina summoned a large mirror of ice, reflecting Thorn's figure so that he could see himself.\"Ah. Yeah. I'm good. A bit stiff.\" Once he caught sight of himself, Thorn could see why he was being stared at. His once shiny silver armor was bent and twisted into an unrecognizable shape. The magma and intense heat put off by the elite fire elementals had begun to melt his armor until the drop in temperature from Mina's ice spells cooled it down. Now partially fused together, it was only Thorn's immense strength that allowed him to keep moving.Reaching up with a creaking arm, Thorn unbuckled his helmet and pulled it off, revealing his smoldering hair. Large portions of his face were burnt bright red, lending him a rather terrifying look. Tossing the helmet to the ground, Thorn began to remove the rest of his armor. Unlike weapons, equipping armor required each piece to be put on manually, so Thorn eventually resorted to simply ripping his melted armor from his body.Watching him casually rip fused chainmail off his arm, Jorge shuddered, reminded of his encounter with Thorn after they had left him for dead. Even Mina, who was quite used to Thorn's absurd strength, was stunned.Dropping the chainmail in a pile, Thorn grabbed his melted breastplate near his armpit and, with a sharp tug, snapped it apart. It was only after his melted greaves landed on the pile of scrap metal that Seven Twisted Leaves regained his presence of mind and directed the Titan squad to begin cleaning up the battlefield.\"So, let's not do that again.\" Once he was out of his armor, Thorn flopped down on the ground and stretched his arms out as he lay exhausted. \"I dunno, I thought it went quite well.\" Jorge's smirk was a mile wide.\"Then next time, you can be the one to walk into the inferno.\"\"Yeah, I wanted to ask about that.\" Mina poked Thorn's shoulder lightly. \"Are you well-done, or are you only medium-well?\"\"Right now I feel way overdone. It was really hot in there.\" Rolling his eyes, Thorn sat up with a groan. \"That is why no one volunteered to do it.\"\"Do you think we can use this method to deal with the other two groups?\" Seven Twisted Leaves asked, his eyes still fixed on the melted stone floor where Thorn had killed the last two elite fire elementals. \"Obviously not today, since your armor has been scrapped and Delmore is on cooldown, but on our next run. Did it feel repeatable?\"\"Sure, but we probably want better fire resistance. My traits make me decently fire resistant, but this was way beyond that. The only reason I was able to make it was the sudden cooldown from Mina's spells. I felt like I was about to be cooked alive. Higher heat resistance would let me operate longer in case something went wrong.\"\"So we need to artificially boost your fire resistance. That means we are looking at potions, armor, or trinkets.\"\"There is a dagger with fire resistance, as well,\" Jorge chimed in. \"Sounds like we have plenty of options.\" Thorn opened up his messenger. \"I'll let Velin know to be on the lookout. Maybe she can find something on the auction house.\"\"Let her know we are coming back, as well.\" Seven Twisted Leaves gestured to the healers, who were all huddled in a group, trying to restore their mana. \"We're tapped out, so let's end it for today.\"Once the loot had been collected and distributed, Thorn found himself holding a stone token shaped like a tear with a strange jagged sun shape cut out of it. One of the players picking up loot had found it and brought it over, with no idea what it was. Assuming it was something important, they handed it over to Seven Twisted Leaves who, after examining it, gave it to Thorn with a shrug. \"We will have to get Baxby to take a look at it.\" Thorn had no idea what it was either. Dropping the stone token into his inventory, he gathered with the rest of the Titan squad and activated the return stone, sending the team back to the entrance of the dungeon. The large crowd was still hanging out outside the dungeon, waiting to form teams to head inside, and the Silver Squire guards were grouped up along the side.Yaim looked over as the team from Nova Luna appeared, his face ugly. Whispering to a silver-armored player who was standing next to him, he pointed toward the Titan squad. \"Incoming,\" Jorge said in a low voice. With a small step backward, the Dwarf vanished into thin air. On the other side of Thorn, Mina took out her wand and held it by her side as she stepped behind Thorn. With a wave and a muttered phrase, she summoned her ice orbs, making them hover behind her back, out of sight. Staying half hidden behind Thorn, she stood quietly.Seeing the immediate action from his two teammates, Thorn was once again reminded that they were entirely abnormal. He could only imagine the sorts of shenanigans that they must have gotten into with Ouroboros for these sorts of behaviors to be so firmly ingrained in their muscle memory. Without his armor, Thorn wanted to avoid fights if he could, but he still drew his tetsubo and leaned on it like it was a walking stick. He had to avoid putting too much pressure on it for fear of snapping it, but it was less obtrusive then holding it on his shoulder.Yaim and the silver-armored player were approaching the Titan squad, backed by almost one hundred and fifty players. This time the Silver Squires seemed like they were ready for Nova Luna and came over with their weapons drawn. Seven Twisted Leaves started to step forward to speak, but Delmore, still shaky from the massive spell he had used to drag the elite fire elemental to Thorn's side, grabbed his shoulder and pulled him back.Thorn did not know what it was that he saw, but the Tigerkin waved his dagger, causing a flood of spirits to burst from the ground, blocking a lightning bolt that lanced through the air toward Seven Twisted Leaves. Furious, the Titan took a step forward, lifting his tetsubo and leveling it at the enemy.\"Ambush! Form up!\" Without waiting for the rest of the Titan squad to react, Thorn jumped forward, activating [Shadow Dash]. As he blurred toward the Silver Squire line, Thorn activated his last instance of [Wolf's Rage]. He had not expected any more trouble and had not bothered to equip any of the random pieces of armor in his inventory, a fact he now regretted.Despite his lack of armor, Thorn hit the Silver Squire line like a freight train going full speed. Players were tossed into the air, scattering like bowling pins as his tetsubo carved a wide gouge in their ranks. A fully armored tank, seeing what happened to the player in front of him, lifted his shield and activated his taunt, causing Thorn's next blow to be drawn toward him, only to find that the weight of the blow was too much to bear. Flicking his tetsubo to detangle the shield that had turned into scrap metal, Thorn punched out with his other hand, causing another player to burst into twinkling lights as they were sent out of the game.At some point during his fights, Thorn had stumbled into the realization that as long as he kept moving, the majority of attacks would not hit him. Even if they did connect, so long as he never stopped, most would, at best, be glancing blows. It was only when he stood still and tried to tank that the damage began to pile up rapidly. Using the rapidly moving, momentum-conserving style that Master Sun had taught him, Thorn carved a devastating path through the enemy.[Wolf's Rage] kept his speed at maximum, allowing him to push forward even as he lashed out with his tetsubo and fists, blasting Silver Squire players into the aether. Suddenly, a large sword slashed out at him before he could react, catching him in the ribs. Gritting his teeth, Thorn spun and snapped out a low roundhouse kick, driving his attacker into the ground. With his spare hand, he grabbed the sword and began to swing it along with his tetsubo, crushing and cutting with abandon.The pain in Thorn's ribs suddenly eased as a healing spell landed on him from the Titan squad healers who had gathered up under Seven Twisted Leaves' leadership. The Fae had reacted almost immediately after Thorn charged forward, taking control of the team and having them move forward to support their boss. The tanks moved up as fast as they could, engaging with the Silver Squire's front line while the healers focused on keeping Thorn up. Both the ranged and melee DPS went wild, cutting down the shaken up enemy as fast as they could. With only fifty players, it was imperative for Nova Luna to keep the Silver Squires on their back foot, since they were outnumbered three to one. When the Silver Squires decided to ambush the Titan squad, they had done so under the impression that they would be returning from the dungeon exhausted, yet watching Nova Luna chop through their forces, Yaim and the silver-armored player could not help but glance at each other, confusion plain in their eyes.\"Why is it that they seem like they haven't fought at all?\" The silver-armored player muttered.\"I have no idea.\" Yaim responded. Drawing his sword, he began to push his way toward Thorn's large figure. Yet, the closer he got, the lower his desire to advance became. In the middle of the crowd, Thorn was smashing through the Silver Squire players like they were twigs, his continuously moving tetsubo blasting apart the defenses of any player that came in range. In his other hand, the shattered remains of the sword he had picked up carved through metal and flesh, sending any player that got in reach out of the game.Unable to survive in close proximity to the raging Titan, players scattered, pushing to get as far away from the whirling steel as possible. In their haste to get away, many players forgot to cast their spells or use their abilities, simply fleeing as fast as they possibly could, only to run into the players from Nova Luna, who were advancing under Seven Twisted Leaves' orders.Realizing that the fight was going poorly, the silver-armored player forced his way through the crowd, shoving the fleeing players out of his way. Making his way over to Yaim, he grabbed him by the shoulder and hissed in his ear.\"That giant is the key. We have to take him down, or we're all dead!\"\"You think I don't know that?\" Yaim snarled back, violently shrugging his shoulder to free it from the silver-armored player's grasp. \"But what are we supposed to do against that?!\"Both players' eyes followed Yaim's finger, only to see a scene of absolute carnage. Thorn had cleared a circle almost twelve feet wide, leaving the ground littered with broken armor and crushed weapons. A few players who had only taken glancing blows lay on the stone floor, groaning, but everyone else who had encountered Thorn's oversized mace had been sent back to spawn.As if sensing their gaze, Thorn's head snapped around, his glowing red eyes locking on to Yaim and the silver-armored figure. With a low roar, Thorn sprang toward them, his tetsubo crushing through the players in the way as if they were made of paper.\"How is he...\" The silver-armored player had no time to finish his sentence as he felt a sudden push on his back. Stumbling forward toward the approaching Titan, he saw Yaim retreating frantically from the corner of his eye. Despair filled his heart as the unstoppable tetsubo swung down, sending him out of the game.\"Get him! Get hi...umpfh!\" Yaim, horrified by the destruction Thorn and the rest of the Titan squad had wrought in the ranks of his men, began screaming as he urged his men forward, only to suddenly find himself choking on a thick blanket of snow. From behind him, Mina's voice rang out.\"[Blizzard]!\" Yaim had a sudden sinking feeling that today was going to be a bad day.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

The Titan squad stood solidly in front of the entrance to the dungeon as Seven Twisted Leaves directed them to cut down the panicking Silver Squire players, a command the Titan squad jumped to follow with surprising gusto. The strategy that Seven Twisted Leaves had devised of having Thorn solo tank the large groups of fire elementals had left the rest of the team fresh and ready for battle, as the Silver Squires were quickly learning.Standing in the middle of the Titan squad, Leaves scanned the impromptu battlefield. The fight had happened so suddenly that he had nearly gotten killed. Only Delmore's quick reaction had saved him from being incinerated by a lightning bolt. Still, the abruptness of the fight worried him. From what he had seen, Yaim and the silver-armored player had been leading their group over for the sake of posturing, not actually fighting. The lightning bolt looked like it came from the large group of Silver Squires behind Yaim, but there were so many other players around that it was impossible to know if that was truly the case. Once the spell had been cast, Thorn had immediately attacked, completely removing any chance the Silver Squires had of claiming their innocence. Now, with the chaos growing, it would not be long before the other guilds arrived in full force.With a sigh, Seven Twisted Leaves sent a quick message to Velin ,only to get a call immediately after.\"What is going on?\" Velin's tone was cold, and Seven Twisted Leaves could tell that she was currently running.\"We walked out of the dungeon and were ambushed. We are currently fighting with Silver Squires.\"Picking up on the discrepancy in his words, Velin's brow furrowed.\"The Silver Squires are not the culprits?\"\"Unconfirmed. But they are certainly paying the price. We are ripping them apart, thanks to Thorn and Mina.\"\"Good, hold on till we get there. Jorge says that there are almost two hundred Silver Guard on route to your position. We're coming, along with Aurum, but there is a high chance they will try and wipe you out before we get there. We will try to be there within five minutes.\"\"Alright, thanks.\" Closing the window, Seven Twisted Leaves glanced around again. The Titan squad had begun to spread out as they pursued the fleeing Silver Squire players who were rushing into the crowds surrounding the entrance. \"Titan squad, withdraw! Tanks, form a defensive line. Melee DPS, hold the flanks. I want the ranged DPS spread out to watch for incoming enemies. Mina, Thorn, get back here!\" Barking out orders, Seven Twisted Leaves went into full blown commander mode. When Velin had recommended him to Thorn, it had been for precisely this reason. With considerable experience commanding teams in the Battlefield of Flame and Shadow, the Fae Druid knew exactly what to do.Towering over the scattering Silver Squire players, Thorn paused to take a breath, his tetsubo resting on the ground. [Wolf's Rage] was starting to fade, and the fatigue from fighting through the dungeon was beginning to make Thorn's body drag. The lack of organization among the Silver Squire players had allowed Thorn to make it through the fight relatively unscathed and the healers from Nova Luna had made sure to keep his health topped up. Still, as Thorn walked back to the Titan squad, he couldn't help but feel the fatigue.The tanks that were lining up stepped aside respectfully as Thorn dragged his huge body into the middle of the group. Not bothering to summon his seat, Thorn sat down on the flagstones and flopped over on his back.\"Ugh, I don't know if I'm good for any more.\" Breathing heavily, Thorn looked up at Seven Twisted Leaves. \"Unless you have some sort of magic potion that will give me energy, I am all tapped out.\"\"No problem, boss.\" Seven Twisted Leaves' bark-like skin crinkled as he smiled. \"The Silver Guard are on their way, but so are Velin and the rest of the guild. We should just be chatting from here on out.\"\"Good. What was all this about, anyway? Is jumping a guild when they come out of a dungeon a common occurrence?\"\"Only if you are at war.\" The Fae Druid shook his head. \"Something fishy is going on here.\"\"Alright. Well, tell me if you need anything. I'll be lying here.\" Thorn lapsed into silence. The fortress itself was awash with light from the many torches along the walls, but the rest of the giant cavern that the fortress occupied was shrouded in darkness. Thanks to his night vision, Thorn did not have any issue seeing into the gloom, and as he lay on his back, his eyes idly wandered over the ceiling.\"Is something wrong with Thorn?\" Mina whispered to Delmore, her eyes darting to Thorn's massive stretched out form.\"Nah, he is just tired.\"\"Oh, good. I mean, it makes sense, right? He just fought through a dungeon full of fire elementals. Still, I sorta wish he'd stand up. I have a feeling we're in for a difficult fight.\"\"Then it is time to showcase what we can do.\" The Tigerkin had a serious expression on his face. \"We're not exactly pushovers ourselves.\"\"Titans, cut the chatter. Tanks, keep your guard up, we have incoming.\" Seven Twisted Leaves' voice carried over the Titan squad, instantly silencing anyone who was talking. The tank line took a half step back, getting closer together as their eyes scanned for threats. Arrayed in a quarter circle with the melee DPS players split into two groups and standing on the flanks, they presented a formidable picture.Within moments, the steady tramp of armored feet marching in perfect time became audible to the Titan squad. \"Nine o'clock,\" Seven Twisted Leaves called out in a low voice. \"Rotate to face them head on. Scouts, pay careful attention to our backs. Tank group two, fall to the rear and protect the healers.\"The Silver Guard entering the scene brought significant pressure to the Titan squad. The armor glistening under the torchlight seemed to produce an intangible aura that suppressed the other players in the area. Marching up to the Titan squad, the Silver Guard halted with a crash exactly forty-five feet from the Titan squad's line. Just far enough away that they were not an easy target but close enough to increase the pressure that the Titan squad was feeling, it was obvious that whoever was leading the Silver Guard this time was an expert.Seven Twisted Leaves, who had been about to order the Titan squad to engage when the Silver Guard reached the forty foot mark, slowly put his hand down, sweat trickling down his cheek. Having learned his lesson from the interaction with the Silver Squires, Seven Twisted Leaves did not step out to the front. \"What is the meaning of this?\" The calmness of his voice did not betray even an ounce of the tension he was feeling as he stared over the heads of Nova Luna's tanks at Raeth, who had appeared at the front of the Silver Guard. \"Is Ragnarok breaking the agreement?\"Impassively, the captain of the Silver Guard examined the Titan squad, his eyes running over their formation. Seeing no readily apparent weakness, he frowned slightly. Nova Luna was turning out to be a harder nut to crack than he had anticipated. Next to him stood a player in red armor, staring with hatred at the group from Nova Luna. Glancing over at Raeth, he caught a slight nod from the captain and stepped forward.\"What do you think you are doing, attacking Ragnarok's allies?\" The red-armored player bellowed. From his position in the center of the crowd, Thorn heard the voice and frowned slightly. The voice sounded familiar, but Thorn could not immediately place it.\"Do you speak for the Silver Guard?\" Refusing to fall into the red-armored player's rhythm, Seven Twisted Leaves kept calm.\"You signed a nonaggression agreement with Ragnarok, and now you think it is okay to attack our allies out of the blue? Do you think that we'll just stand idly by while you walk all over us?\"Peeking her head out from behind the tanks, Mina looked at the red-armored player and quickly returned to Thorn. \"That is Korith. I wonder what he is doing here?\"\"Maybe Angdrin and Sylith are working together now?\" Thorn shrugged his shoulders without getting up. Still lying down, he began to comb through his inventory for pieces of armor that he could equip. If Korith was in charge, it was likely that this encounter would devolve into a fight, and Thorn wanted to be as ready as possible.\"We had an agreement with Ragnarok. We did not have an agreement with the Silver Squires. It is our right to defend ourselves and since they attacked us, we acted within that right. If you want to attack us, get to it. You're a top ten guild. You don't need to build a moral case to get away with bullying smaller guilds.\" Seven Twisted Leaves was determined to give as good as he got in this verbal exchange.According to Velin's message, the reinforcements she was bringing were currently being obstructed by the other two hundred Silver Guard and close to four hundred of Angdrin's Crimson Snakes. Facing up against such a strong force, Nova Luna could not afford for the situation to devolve into a full blown war, so they had to tread carefully.\"Haha, yeah, right.\" Korith sneered. \"You say that they attacked you first, but how do we know if that is true?\"\"There are plenty of witnesses to what happened.\" \"Oh?\" The Crimson Snake looked around in an exaggerated fashion at the groups of players standing nearby. \"Do you think they'll step forward on your behalf? As far as I am concerned, you are the ones that attacked first. Which means that you are the ones that are out of line.\"\"Are you allowing him to speak for you?\" Seven Twisted Leaves turned to look at Raeth, who did not respond.\"Hey, tree man, I am talking to you.\" Korith's eyes narrowed, and he took a step forward, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword. \"You need to give us a good explanation for your actions, otherwise don't blame us for cutting you down where you stand.\"Seven Twisted Leaves was at a loss. He was an excellent commander, but he was not the leader of Nova Luna or even of the Titan squad and had no idea how he should be responding to Korith's aggressive stance. Unfortunately, Thorn seemed content to let him bear the brunt of Ragnarok's aggression. With an annoyed glance back toward the spot where his giant boss was still sprawled out, he shook his head.\"Nova Luna has abided by the agreement we signed. I'm sure that Thorn will be very upset to hear that Ragnarok is breaching his trust. And believe me when I say that Lord Greymane, the Moon Wolf, is not someone you want upset.\"\"Haha! If he is so good, where is he? I heard that he ran off back to his dog house with his tail between his legs after we took the fortress from under his nose.\" Korith's voice was grating. \"Moon Wolf? More like toothless dog. The only reason he got anywhere is because that traitor Ouroboros handed it to him on a platter. Besides, the mangy wolf people and their lame wolf god weren't worth the effort to Ragnarok, otherwise he would not have gotten within ten miles of the valley. We have no need of a flea bitten night wolf, either.\"Still staring up at the roof of the cavern when he heard the insult, Thorn's eyebrows went up. With a sigh, he slowly pulled himself into a sitting position. From where he sat, he could not see through the tightly grouped players, so he laboriously hauled himself to his feet, muttering something incomprehensible to himself. His head rose above the crowd like a growing tree until he towered over everyone there.His hair disheveled and his face dirty, Thorn had yet to change out of the clothes he was wearing when he fought the three elite fire elementals. Torn, charred and dirty, the clothing he wore looked like it had been pulled from a dumpster. Combined with the exhausted look on his face, and his strange muttering, Thorn looked more like a giant hobo than a baron, a fact that Korith picked up on immediately.\"Ha, so the mangy dog is here.\" Unamused, Thorn stared down at Korith, who was unimpressed. The Crimson Snake sneered at Thorn, his hand caressing the hilt of the sword at his waist.\"What, are you going to come out and try to bite me? If you want to fight, lets fight!\"*WHUUM*\"Aaah!\"Before anyone could react, Korith let out a short, sharp scream, his figure disappearing into the aether in a cloud of twinkling lights. The space where he had stood a moment before was now occupied by a boulder, the same boulder that Thorn normally used for a seat.Thorn, his arm still extended from his throw, slowly straightened up, his cold gaze running across the Silver Guard players. He was not particularly concerned about what people thought of him. Mocking his title, however, was the same as mocking Hati, which was something Thorn could not overlook.[Well done, child.] Hati's warm, rich voice echoed in Thorn's heart, igniting the excitement in his chest that the fatigue had hidden. Waves of energy began to flow through him as his strength returned, the drained feeling vanishing. Lifting his head, Thorn's cold gaze began to burn intensely. *ding* Taking two steps forward, Thorn arrived at the front line, the tanks moving to either side to allow him to stand in the middle of the line. Silver energy swirled around his figure, covering the hodge-podge armor that he had equipped, reshaping it with the [Blessing of Hati] into the familiar silver Moon Wolf armor that Thorn normally wore. As the spiraling energy cleared, a terrifying helmet shaped like a wolf's head appeared, steam curling from the open mouth.Seeing the silver-armored Titan taking another step forward, it was everything that most of the Silver Guard could do to not take a step backward as Thorn's aura washed over them. The front line of Silver Guard were not so lucky, instinctively stumbling back under the full force of the pressure radiating from Thorn. They might have fallen over on the spot if Raeth had not taken a step forward, helping them block the aura by releasing his. -----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

Or I will move you.\" Thorn's words left no room for Raeth. Either the Silver Guard would move or Thorn would begin the fight. Despite feeling physically rejuvenated, Thorn was still mentally tired and in no mood to play at words.\"Are you threate...\"\"No more word games.\" Thorn summoned his tetsubo, leveling it at Raeth's head. \"You get out of our way or you break the agreement.\"\"We are not the ones who just attacked.\" Shooting a meaningful glance at the boulder that had crushed Korith. At the same time, he took a small step back to try and appear less aggressive, as it was obvious that Thorn was about to snap.\"That was a duel to restore Hati's honor.\" Under his helmet, Thorn smirked.\"Duel?\"\"Yeah, didn't you hear him challenge me? I accepted, naturally. It wouldn't be good to turn down a duel. Besides, duels fall outside the terms of the agreement. It's in the fourth section, paragraph nine, about half way down the page. Why? Do you want to duel, as well? I'd be happy to send you on your way to join Korith.\"\"Raeth! Stand down.\" Before Thorn could even finish his sentence, Sylith's voice rang out, cutting the tension significantly. Turning his head slowly, Thorn saw the Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight rushing over with Velin following behind him. His face lighting up in a big smile, Thorn ignored Sylith, who was whispering to Raeth, and walked over to greet the Elven War Priestess.\"Hey, what are you doing here?\"\"I heard that you were under fire, so I thought I would come check it out.\" Giving a small smile, Velin looked him over carefully. \"You look tired.\"\"Haha, I don't feel too bad. We just got out of the dungeon. It was really hot.\" Taking off his helmet, Thorn rubbed the back of his head as he grinned. \"Seriously though, what are you doing here? Didn't you say that you had stuff to do?\"\"Word on the street is that you are making a lot of progress. So I thought it would be a good idea to meet up. It is a bad neighborhood.\"Thorn glanced at Seven Twisted Leaves, who looked away casually. Regardless of why she had come to meet them, Thorn was just pleased that Velin was there. It felt better facing their enemies together. Excited to tell her about his experience in the dungeon, Thorn swallowed his words and put his helmet back on. First, he had to deal with Sylith.\"What's going on with Ragnarok? Why is Sylith giving way? That doesn't seem like him.\"\"I'm actually not sure.\" Velin frowned, her forehead wrinkling. \"He is definitely up to something, and no doubt whatever it is will be bad for us. Our sources say that he is making better progress than us on getting through the labyrinth.\"\"Sure, but has he cleared any of the large groups of fire elementals?\"\"Are you serious? Did you...? How on earth did you do that?\"Thorn saw that Sylith was walking toward him, so he stepped forward to meet the Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight after winking at the open-mouthed Elf. Sylith's handsome face held a pleasant smile that faltered slightly as he got close to Thorn. Recovering his calm demeanor almost instantly, he greeted Thorn as if the standoff between their guilds had never happened.\"Hello, Baron. Nice to see you again. How has your progress in the dungeon been?\"Looking down at the proffered hand, Thorn's head tilted to the side in confusion. Enveloping Sylith's hand with his own, Thorn shook it lightly. He was having trouble with the good cop, bad cop routine that Sylith and Raeth seemed so committed to playing.\"Eh, we've been muddling along. We are probably not as far along as you are, though. I heard that you have some of the best dungeon teams around.\"\"Hahaha, we do alright.\" Still smiling, Sylith pulled his hand back from Thorn's grip. \"Anyway, I'm sorry about the trouble here. We realized too late that the Silver Squires were in the wrong. They shouldn't have attacked you, and we shouldn't have stopped you.\"\"And Korith?\"\"Ah, don't worry about him. He shouldn't have been shooting off his mouth. I'll deal with him and with the Silver Squires. I want you to know that Ragnarok takes our agreement very seriously, Thorn. We are determined to honor it, and I will make sure that things like this don't happen again. I hope that you can forgive Yaim and the Silver Squires. We asked them to help us guard the entrance, and it's apparent that they got a bit overzealous.\"\"Mmm.\" Thorn's reply was noncommittal, but Sylith did not seem to mind at all. After chatting for a few more minutes, he gathered his guild members and, only leaving fifty of the Silver Guard to watch the entrance to the dungeon, led the others away. Watching the silver-armored block of players leave, Thorn could not help but shake his head.\"I'd love to know what he is thinking. I totally thought that we would have a fight,\" Mina complained.\"You and me both. He is one slippery guy.\"\"Thorn, were you serious about clearing one of the large groups of fire elementals? Did you find anything?\" Velin was still stuck on what Thorn had said before.\"Yeah, so what?\" Thorn was only half paying attention to the question, his mind still mulling over Sylith's abrupt change in attitude. \"What is the big deal? Isn't that normal?\"\"No, it's not normal!\" Velin was so exasperated she dropped the pencil she had just gotten out. Picking it up, she flipped to a blank page in her notebook. \"Tell me all about it. I want to know every detail.\"\"Uh, you might have to ask Leaves, or maybe Mina. I was pretty busy smashing things.\" Thorn chuckled, earning himself a glare from the Elf. Looking around, Thorn stifled a yawn. \"Let's head back to camp, we can talk there. Has anyone seen Jorge? Man, I really need a nap.\"\"Sure, we can talk at camp, but you better not leave anything out.\"Seeing Velin this worked up amused Thorn as he led his guild back to the camp. Asher came out to see Thorn when they walked by his camp, checking to see if his giant friend was alright. He had originally brought his men with Velin, but turned around after they met Sylith. Once he was assured that Thorn had not come out of the encounter worse for wear, Asher waved goodbye, returning to his camp.\"Nice guy. So, are you going to tell me what happened with Sylith?\" Thorn kept his eyes on Asher's back as he spoke to Velin, who sighed.\"Honestly, I do not actually know. The best guess I can come up with is that he got information from somewhere that made him change his plans. He was ready to go to war when he stopped us. Swords drawn and everything. It was a seriously tense situation. Then, all of a sudden, he got a strange look on his face and stopped talking for two minutes. If I didn't know him better, I would have thought that he logged out and someone else logged into his character, because, after that, he was all smiles and concern.\"\"Huh.\" Thorn scratched his chin as they walked into the large command tent. Seeing Baxby standing over the map, Thorn nodded to him before looking back at Velin. \"Curious.\" \"Quite. Now, stop stalling and tell me how you cleared the large group of fire elementals.\" Velin took a seat, her notebook ready.\"Ha, sure. But you have to tell me why it is such a big deal after I'm done.\"\"Deal.\"\"Alright, so this is how it went down.\" Thorn's face was serious, his deep voice silencing all the noise in the tent. Staring off into the distance and taking a deep breath, he said, \"I rushed in and beat them all up.\"Silence reigned in the tent for a moment, and then Velin shrieked and threw her notebook at Thorn's head. Ducking to avoid the impromptu missile, Thorn laughed, holding up his big hands to ward off the Elven War Priestess's punches. Mina, Seven Twisted Leaves, and Baxby all suppressed their laughter as they watched Velin trying to beat Thorn up.\"Alright, alright, I'll stop. I'll stop.\" Thorn was still chuckling to himself as he sat down in his big chair. \"The truth is that Leaves had a great idea, which we tested on small groups of fire elementals before moving on to the big group. I was not joking when I said I solo-tanked them. Granted, it only worked because I had the full support of the healers, and even then there were a lot of close shaves.\"\"You solo-tanked,\" Velin muttered. \"That shouldn't work. The heat should wipe out your endurance even if your health is full.\"\"What do you mean?\" It was Thorn's turn to be confused. \"Elemental damage has secondary effects. Cold slows processing speed and reaction time in addition to doing direct damage. Lightning, or shock damage, drains mana and deals direct damage. Fire damage drains stamina or endurance. Even if you can block the direct damage, you should have fainted from exhaustion.\"\"Ah. No wonder I feel so tired.\" Thorn slapped his chair's armrest lightly. A bit unsure how to approach this subject, he looked around. \"Well, my racial trait minimizes physical effects, so maybe that has something to do with it.\"\"Maybe a little bit, but it doesn't explain how you could stand in the middle of two elite fire elementals,\" Seven Twisted Leaves chimed in.\"Yeah, what was that about, Thorn?\" Even Mina was getting in on the chance to pry open Thorn's secrets. \"The damage from that level of heat should be enough to leave you drained almost instantly!\"\"Uh.\" Thorn looked down, a sheepish grin on his face as he muttered in a quiet voice. \"I don't get tired.\"\"You what?\" Everyone leaned in.\"I don't get tired. I think I have nearly unlimited stamina.\" Looking around after he repeated himself, it got quiet as the others just stared at him. Mina, not even bothering to respond, threw her hands in the air and walked out of the tent. \"Hey, it's true. I normally don't get tired at all. This time I'm pretty beat, but I still feel like I could squeeze out another fight if I had to. Why are you looking at me like that?\"Velin sighed and put away her notebook after looking at Seven Twisted Leaves, who shrugged. The old treasure hunter, who had been listening from the side, walked over to Thorn and patted him on the shoulder.\"Don't worry about them, kid. Those of us who are different understand. Everyone has their advantages, just most are buried deep while yours are up near the surface. So, tell me, did you find anything interesting when you wiped out the big group?\"\"We picked up lots of loot. Oh, and this.\" Getting the tear-shaped stone token out of his inventory, he handed it to Baxby, who looked it over with interest. The old man took it with him as he walked back to the map, muttering the whole time. Placing it down on top of the map, Baxby poked it with his finger a few times.\"What is that?\" Velin asked, walking over to the map and running her fingers lightly over the surface of the stone token. \"Is it used with the Dwarven earth maps?\"\"Looks more like a key.\" \"A key?\" Thorn, standing from his chair, made his way over, as well. \"Doesn't look like much of a key to me.\"\"And that, kid, is because you lack imagination. This is a Dwarven key. It is probably part of a set that has been divided. My guess is that this is a hidden part of the quest, since clearing the large elemental teams is not something most teams will be able to complete. But yes, this is a key,\" Baxby explained, tracing a finger around the outside.\"Normal keys have a set of ridges on them that push pins, right? This is the same, to an extent. If we flip it over, you can see those channels, right? The channels allow a magic circuit to be completed, unlocking the door or chest or whatever this opens. See how it has two shapes, one on the outside edge and one on the inside cut-out? Between those two shapes, we can have infinite variation. The shape on the outside tells you roughly where the key is from, the shape on the inside determines what it can open. If both shapes don't fit, the key will not work.\"\"That makes sense, I guess.\" Looking at the stone token, Thorn blinked and scratched his head. \"So that means we just need to clear the other two big groups of fire elementals, right?\"\"Yes, we just need to clear the elementals.\" Velin nodded, looking over at Seven Twisted Leaves, who perked up.\"I've got an idea for that. Since we can have Thorn tank, why not let him do that fully. We can swap out our balanced build specifically for taking out the large groups of fire elementals. Instead of running a full line of tanks and DPS, we can swap in more crowd control and healing. This way we can maximize Thorn's survivability and have better ways to deal with the elite fire elementals. We barely scraped by this time, and Delmore is probably out of commission for a few days, as a result. If we can plan for it and bring the right people, we should be able to clear both fights in the same day.\"Looking at Velin and seeing her nod, Thorn agreed. \"Good, let's do that. I'm a bit worried about Ragnarok, so the faster we do this, the better. Leaves, can you help Velin come up with a good team? I really need to sleep, but let's plan on another run first thing tomorrow.\"\"Sure thing, boss.\"\"Have a good sleep, Thorn.\" Velin smiled briefly at Thorn and then left the tent with the Fae Druid in tow, leaving Thorn and Baxby alone. The old man glanced at Thorn.\"I'm going to keep examining the map and the key. I want to see if I can figure out where the circuit connects, though my guess is that we will need to get the other half of the Dwarven earth map for that. Still, good job getting this key. I can smell the scent of something awesome locked away down here.\"\"Oh? How exciting.\" Stifling a yawn, Thorn smiled at Baxby, who just rolled his eyes. With a wave, Thorn headed over to one of the partitioned areas and collapsed into bed.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

In his dreams he was tied to a spit and slowly cooked by a collection of different elementals. Below him, a massive fire elemental was chained just out of reach, thick waves of heat rolling over him as it strained against its bonds. The other elementals were quietly arguing over the best way to prepare a Titan when the large elemental surged forward with a roar, the sound of its chains snapping waking Thorn with a jolt.Rubbing his eyes, Thorn looked around the tent. Through a crack in the curtain separating his sleeping area from the main room, Thorn could see Velin, Baxby, and Seven Twisted Leaves talking around the table. Rolling over in his comfortable bed, Thorn stared up at the roof of the tent, letting the low murmur of voices wash over him. Despite his strange dream, the system had done its job, and Thorn was feeling refreshed. Getting up after a few minutes, he stretched and walked into the center room of the tent, nodding to the three people gathered around the map.\"Morning.\"\"Good morning, Thorn,\" Velin replied, her pencil never pausing as she wrote in her notebook. Seven Twisted Leaves saluted Thorn in greeting, but the old treasure hunter just grunted, his eyes fixed on the map.\"Any new developments?\" Taking a quick glance at the map, Thorn saw that there were a couple spots filled that had not been when he went to bed the night before. The details in those areas were not quite as clear as the rest of the map, but the general shape of the passageways were there.\"Yeah, Asher shared some information from their run, which is how we were able to fill in these sections.\" Velin finally gave her pencil a rest as she pointed toward the new spots on the map. \"Oh, and Corvo sent a message over. I think the Dwarven earth map we want has been found. The Eastern Alliance has it, and from what he said, they are willing to trade.\"\"Oh? That is great news.\" Both Thorn and Baxby perked up at Velin's words.\"It is. Though we'll need to send a group to do the trade. World Quest items have some restrictions, and they are a guaranteed drop, so I'm a little concerned that if any other guilds have heard about it, we'll be in for a fight.\"\"By guaranteed drop, you mean that if I am carrying it and I die, it will drop for sure?\"\"Yup, 100% drop rate. So we need to make sure you don't die.\"\"Alright, got it. Have we made arrangements to do the trade?\" Thorn took his seat at the head of the table, his eyes running across the map.\"We have.\" Flipping back a few pages in her notebook, Velin ran her finger down the page. \"Tomorrow. We'll be meeting them in the dungeon, at the entrance connecting the air and fire sections.\"\"Wow, you guys move fast. I guess everyone is in a rush to get this finished as fast as possible.\"\"We're on a strict time limit, after all. The first group to make it through the labyrinth will have an advantage in the next part of the quest.\"\"Guess that's true.\" Thorn's finger tapped his armrest as he considered. A thought crossed his mind, making him look up. \"Wait a second. You said that we'll be meeting them in the dungeon? I thought it was instanced? Doesn't that mean when we go in, we're by ourselves?\"\"Only when we're running the dungeon,\" Seven Twisted Leaves answered. \"Dungeons have a few different modes. Exploration mode, which doesn't count your progress and is not instanced, and Diving mode, which does track your progress.\"\"This all seems unnecessarily complicated.\" Thorn sighed, resting his cheek in his broad palm. \"Why would we want two different modes?\"\"Different kinds of players and different sorts of treasures.\" This time it was Baxby who spoke up.\"What do you mean?\"\"Can you imagine unaffiliated players having to compete with guilds? They'd get swatted. So, there are two different modes for the dungeons. The Diving mode is designed for big groups and has increased difficulty and rewards, making it ideal for guilds who have the people and the organization to clear the dungeon. Exploration, on the other hand, gives enough resources for a small group or individual, but not enough for a big group to split. \"Exploration is also the mode where you can find out more about the history of the dungeon, catch the lead on quests related to the dungeon, that sort of thing. However, the two modes are effectively different dungeons. So the pathing is not the same. Big guilds don't care about the quests and that sort of stuff, instead just focusing on swallowing up as many resources as they possibly can, so Exploration mode isn't used much except by us unaffiliated.\"\"So, Exploration mode isn't instanced? What stops players from attacking each other?\"\"Ha, nothing. Exploration is even more dangerous than Diving for that very reason. You've got to be on your toes, because every player you meet could be your enemy.\" Baxby's eyes glowed with excitement as he spoke. \"When you combine that with the fact that most groups that explore are smaller, it can get quite exciting.\"\"Then, isn't there a danger of a group trying to monopolize the Exploration mode?\"\"Ha, some people try.\" The old treasure hunter turned his head as if he was going to spit but was confronted with the plush carpet that covered the ground, and he just swallowed. \"Every once in a while, someone tries, but the guilds are always looking to improve their reputations, so they'll sweep out any group that tries to lock up a dungeon.\"\"Interesting. Velin, what are your thoughts on the exchange? Is it possible that it is a trap?\"\"We considered that.\" The Elf brushed her hair back from her face. \"Corvo and I had a long talk about this trade, and that is one of the things that came up. However, because of how the trade came about, I don't think it is likely.\"\"What do you mean?\"\"Corvo said that the information came from your connection down in the south, Josephine. One of her agents from the Eastern Alliance passed on the intelligence to one of our agents, who passed it on to Corvo. Apparently, the Eastern Alliance is still not sure what to do with the maps they have. They got four of them, but none show the air section where they entered the dungeon.\"When Corvo reached out to them, they agreed to do the trade with the added condition that we show them how the earth maps work, as well as let them know if we figure out who has the other air map. There is a remote chance that it is a trap, but since Corvo was the one who reached out, we're relatively confident that it is just a normal exchange.\"\"Excellent. You all do really great work.\" Thorn smiled appreciatively. \"Then, are we sending the Titan squad to make the swap? I'm all rested up and ready to go.\"\"Yes, you and the Titan squad will go, though this time I'm coming with you, as is Baxby.\" Velin gestured to the treasure hunter, who grinned. \"While we are in Exploring mode, I want to try and learn more about the labyrinth, just in case it can provide clues for the next section of the quest.\"\"Alright. The exchange is tomorrow, right? What were your thoughts in the meantime? Should we clear another one of the large groups? Leaves, you were working on a better team composition for that, right?\"\"Yes, sir.\" The Fae Druid, who had been listening quietly, spread out a piece of paper with fifty names written on it. \"I put together a list of players whom, I think, will make this very easy. Normally, a single healer can keep up with two tanks or a tank and two DPS, so our split is twelve tanks, twenty six DPS, and twelve healers or support. With our new method, we only need you as a tank, plus a couple more to protect the healers.\"For our next run we will be taking more crowd control, as well as more healers. We have a total of five tanks, including you, fifteen DPS, and thirty healers or support. This means we should be able to bubble you enough that we don't need any crazy maneuvers, and you can just fight through the elite fire elementals. We also found some fire resistant gloves for you and a couple of trinkets which will hopefully be a help in mitigating the heat. They shouldn't mess with your set bonus' too much.\"\"Good.\" Despite his nonchalance, Thorn was secretly glad that they had done something about the heat. The feeling of being cooked was an unpleasant one, and even though he had come out fine, he was not excited to repeat the experience. Thorn opened his menu and pulled up the armor he currently had equipped. Thorn had been startled when he realized that the armor he had hastily put on before his fight with Korith had been reshaped into the [Blessed Armor of Hati]. The armor he had been wearing during his fight with the elite fire elementals had been completely ruined, turned into a smoldering pile of scrap by the flaming attacks. Unsure why his new armor was reformed into the familiar silver shape, Thorn began to dig through his logs to try and figure out what was going on.It took some searching, but eventually, from a clue hidden in his [Wolf Hide] ability, Thorn realized that the [Blessed Armor of Hati] was connected with gaining Hati's favor. The first time his armor had changed was when he first became an avatar. Since then, each time he received Hati's favor, there had been no change in his armor because it already had the [Blessing of Hati], so he had not noticed it. He had looked at his [Wolf Hide] ability before, but this time, he noticed an extra few lines at the end.  Unlike the set of masterwork armor that he had ruined in the dungeon, the random assortment of armor he was wearing had some special abilities, though a few were terrible. The chest piece he had equipped did boost his overall defense, but the gloves actually reduced it while giving him a miniscule buff to his critical hit rate. Even his greaves were old and had a permanently lower durability, meaning that they would break much faster.Thankfully, the [Blessing of Hati] gave Thorn some buffs, increasing his agility and armor, along with buffs to [Wolf's Rage] and the new [Wolf Helm] he had unlocked. Replacing his gloves would make him lose the [6 pieces] set bonus, but since he had not unlocked [Wolf Form] it really was not a big deal. He would also have a slight decrease in the other buffs granted by the [Blessing of Hati], but the increased fire resistance would more than make up for it. Until Thorn was near the temple of Hati in Fang Valley, he was stuck with the mis-matched armor that he had put on before he threw the boulder at Korith.A few hours later, Thorn was standing with part of the Titan squad in front of the dungeon entrance. With them were a number of support players from the other two squads who had been transferred over to try out Seven Twisted Leaves' solo tanking strategy. An hour earlier the gloves and two accessories had been delivered, boosting Thorn's fire resistance significantly, and Seven Twisted Leaves had reorganized the Titan squad temporarily.   Equipping the gloves, pendent, and bracelet, Thorn instantly felt cooler, as though separated from the hot wind blowing out of the dungeon by a thin barrier. The increased fire resistance did not prevent Thorn from knowing how hot it was. Instead, it just removed the impact of the heat on his body.\"Okay, is everyone good?\" This time around, Thorn had taken over command from Seven Twisted Leaves. Having watched the Fae Druid lead the dungeon diving team the day before, the Titan was ready to give it a shot. Seeing the team signal that they were ready, Thorn took a deep breath to calm himself, and led the way into the labyrinth.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

Come explore the world of Nova Terra and help me determine where the story goes.You can find out more about me at www.sethring.com", "The burning heat of the forge district was enough to cause spontaneous combustion, and Thorn knew that if his fire resistance was not as high as it was that his hair would have already caught on fire. Thankfully, the three pieces of equipment that Seven Twisted Leaves had found were working wonders, allowing Thorn to tank three elite fire elementals at the same time. Completely surrounded by hordes of fire elementals, Thorn spun his tetsubo around his body, warding off the flaming attacks as best he could.Countless fireballs slipped through his defenses, splashing against his armor. The fireballs from the smaller fire elementals were not a huge issue, though the sheer quantity of them made them dangerous. It was the large, blue colored [Fire Spears] from the three elite fire elementals that made Thorn worry. Doing his best to dodge, Thorn found himself stepping on regular fire elementals who packed in around him like sardines.The constant barrage of attacks was matched by an equally dense barrage of healing spells and bubbles as the large group of healers focused on keeping Thorn afloat in the sea of fire. Though there had been some close calls against the first large group of fire elementals that Nova Luna had faced this run, the fight against the second large group was going smoothly, reminding Thorn once more how lucky he was to be playing with skilled players.\"[Holy Shield]!\" One of the priests called out, summoning the golden shield of light just in time to block two [Fire Spear] attacks. \"[Aegis of Time]!\" Immediately after the golden shield shattered from the force of the stacked [Fire Spear] attacks, an arcane clock appeared in front of Thorn, dropping him into a special pocket of time. The third [Fire Spear] ripped through his chest like a stick poking through a reflection on the surface of a lake, continuing on until it impacted the wall with a loud boom. Burning magma splashed across the floor, heating up the packed fire elementals. Completely unharmed by the attack, Thorn's figure rippled in the wake of the attack, slowly solidifying as the [Aegis of Time] faded.During the first run, Thorn had only faced up against two elite fire elementals at a time, so the ambient heat generated by their passive ability had been manageable. But this time, the three fire elementals had been closer together, allowing Thorn to pull them all into combat without need to resort to any tricks. Still, Thorn was sweating uncomfortably as the waves of heat pushed against him.\"Clear the fire elementals on the left edge.\" Thorn's voice carried easily to the solid block of players standing forty feet behind him. From the center of the fight, Thorn was able to direct the flow of the battle, making it even easier to focus down the enemy. This was the third of the three large groups that had plagued so many guilds, and after the smaller fire elementals were thinned out, the elite fire elementals would fall.\"Focus on the elemental I mark.\" Directing the DPS to coordinate with him, Thorn abruptly slammed forward with his tetsubo, knocking two of the elite fire elementals back. Spinning, he drew back his arm and pointed his weapon at the third elite fire elemental, holding out his other hand as a guide. \"Attack!\" With a deep shout, he thrust forward, the jagged end of his tetsubo cutting into the flaming body of the elite fire elemental. The force of the thrust shattered the protective layer of fire that covered the elite fire elemental's body, sinking into the burning blue core and causing it to halt, as if stunned. As his weapon connected, fifteen ranged attacks took advantage of the broken protective field as they fell on the elite fire elemental's back, dealing huge amounts of damage. Unable to resist the attacks, the elite fire elemental gave a wail and dissipated in a flash of light, leaving behind a core and a few pieces of loot.\"Next target. Attack!\" Without pausing, Thorn whirled toward his next target, bringing his tetsubo down in a vicious swing. Within a few minutes, the elite fire elementals had fallen and the regular fire elementals had been cleaned up, leaving a pile of loot for the players to dig through. Nova Luna had made remarkable progress, wiping out two of the large groups in a single day, thanks to Seven Twisted Leaves' strategy and Thorn's new gear.\"Here you go. This is the third one.\" Jorge handed another of the stone keys over to Thorn. The first of the stone keys had been shaped like a teardrop and the second like a leaf, while this one was shaped like a crescent moon. Taking it, Thorn examined it for a while, and seeing that it was made of the same material as the others, he put it away in his inventory. The rest of the loot was quickly split up amongst the party, with those who did not get gear receiving a bigger share of the resources that dropped. Thorn did not take anything for himself, instead opting to let the rest of the players get a larger share.Loot had no particular attraction for Thorn, and he probably would have left most of the drops on the ground if it had been his decision. As it was, Mina made sure that everything of value was harvested, leaving the ground cleaner than when they arrived. Making full use of Thorn's bottomless inventory, the Ice Witch directed him to take anything that looked like it might be of worth, and quite a few things that didn't.\"Mina, I don't think we need any more pillars.\" Refusing to pull any more of the carved pillars from the wall, he waved his hand. \"We can study the ones we have and come back if we need more.\"\"But how do you know we'll be able to find this place again? This stupid labyrinth is really confusing. The heat waves make it super disorienting. We need the whole set so we can study them properly. How are we supposed to decipher all of the secrets of the Dwarves if we don't have a full set?\"\"But we took a full set from the last room and these ones are exactly the same.\"\"But...\"\"No. No more. Unless you want to carry them yourself, we are done.\" Thorn shook his head firmly. \"Alright, are we ready to go out?\"Appearing in front of the entrance to the dungeon, Thorn scanned the area. His last encounter with the Silver Squires had made him wary of other guilds. The Silver Squires were back in force, many of their players having respawned after the fight against Nova Luna, but they turned away as Thorn and his teammates appeared. Many of the other players who were milling around the dungeon entrance hurried to clear the way, as well, the scene of the Titan squad ripping through the Silver Squires still fresh in their minds.\"Thank you all for your hard work.\" Once they had arrived back at Nova Luna's camp, Thorn addressed the team. \"We made some good progress today. Tomorrow, some of you will be running with me again while others will be back to mapping the dungeon. Please see your group leaders to find out where you are assigned. You are dismissed.\"Entering the center tent, Thorn tossed the two stone keys to Baxby and plopped down in his chair. Despite having fought through two large groups of fire elementals and killing six elite fire elementals, he was significantly less tired than the day before.\"How are you holding up?\" Velin finished making a note and flipped her notebook closed. \"I am doing well. These fights were not nearly as bad, thanks to the fire resistance. These things are pretty useful.\" Thorn tapped a thick finger on the pendent around his neck.\"Quite. Resistance is one of the most sought-after abilities in the game because it allows you to go where other players cannot.\"\"I can see that. Any further update on the exchange?\"\"Nothing new. Eastern Alliance is asking that we arrive by noon, so we'll set off first thing tomorrow morning. The Exploration mode labyrinth is not as hot as the Diving mode, so we can take the regular squad.\"\"Alright, sounds good.\" Thorn rubbed the back of his head and let out a sigh. \"I need to call Corvo to figure out what is going on with the merchants we locked up. It has been a couple of days, so hopefully they've changed their tune. Ugh. I never imagined that becoming a noble would bring so many petty arguments.\"\"Petty?\" Velin's eyebrows rose slightly.\"Okay, maybe not petty. I do understand the importance of them,\" Thorn reassured the ruffled Elf with a smile. \"I just don't like the power games, and I wish I did not have to be involved.\"\"An understandable position, if naive,\" Velin scoffed. Shaking her head, she held up two fingers. \"Thorn, only two people don't have to play power games, the powerless, and the all-powerful. Everyone else is perpetually locked in a power game. That is all life is.\" Velin's expression was serious, and Thorn could see a touch of despair haunting in her eyes.\"Do you think so?\" At first, Thorn was tempted to dismiss her words, but the flash of emotion that he spotted made him pause. \"Yes. The powerless are free because even though their lives are directed by the whims of others, they cannot play. The all-powerful are above the game and have no need to play. For the rest of us, we struggle against those below while trying to pull down those above, all in a vain effort to join the all-powerful while avoiding becoming the powerless.\"Velin's impassioned words seemed to hang in the air even after she finished speaking. Seeing that Thorn was looking at her intently, she blushed slightly, as if embarrassed by her outburst. Opening her mouth as if to say more, Velin hesitated and finally said nothing, her eyes falling to the carpet. The mood in the tent was solemn as Thorn and Velin faced each other. At the table, Baxby watched quietly, his face inscrutable, his eyes strangely bright.Finally, unable to bear the silence, Velin spoke again.\"Thorn, you grew up as one of the all-powerful. You have no idea how the real world works. Sickness, disease, poverty, all these things have been removed from society, but that never stopped people from trying to gain power over others. It's all I saw growing up. Everyone is always trying to maneuver so that they are over other people. Everyone does it. Even I do it.\"\"What about Mina?\"\"Ha, Mina is one of the powerless.\"\"I don't know that I would call her powerless,\" Thorn protested lightly, his mind turning back to the sight of her dropping a snowstorm on Yaim.\"Sure, in the game, she is strong.\" Velin seemed to know exactly what Thorn was thinking. \"But that strength is useless if she cannot protect herself from being manipulated by other people. When I met her, she was being used by everyone around her, and she had no idea. Mina is one of the powerless, Thorn.\"\"I understand.\" Thorn nodded. \"But do you really think that this is all there is to life?\"\"No, of course not. The sun rises and sets, nature continues regardless of the petty games we play. I am just saying that those petty games have real consequences for our lives and the lives of others, and that while you might be able to ignore them, the rest of us can't. We don't have that privilege.\"Once again, the tent fell silent. It was evident that Velin was speaking from her heart, expressing a vulnerability that Thorn had never seen before. Growing up, he had witnessed these power games she spoke of first hand, though always from the detached position of a spectator. Even when they involved his aunt or his company, he had the privilege of having others play on his behalf. He had never needed to struggle against others for advantage, never needed to defend himself. There were always others who jumped at the chance to do that work for him. As Thorn thought about it, he realized that those people were playing the game as well, though he had been blissfully unaware that there was a game going on. They rushed to gain his approval and favor, as a simple nod or quiet word from him could elevate their status above that of their coworkers and peers.Hearing the quiet despair laced through Velin's words, Thorn did not have to be a genius to realize just how deeply impacted she was. He had no idea what she had experienced as she grew, but it had obviously been difficult. Suffering had a way of carving a worldview into a person that no amount of reason could overcome. As much as he wanted to refute her words by pointing to the relationship that they had, he couldn't. Unless she experienced something drastically different, everything she saw would simply confirm her thoughts. Thinking back over everything they had experienced, what she said hit home. Ouroboros and the team's betrayal had been a textbook example of what she was talking about, and even the situations they had faced together pointed toward her idea. \"Then let's change the game.\" The deep, low rumble of Thorn's voice was comforting. \"If, as you say, life's natural state is a power struggle, then let's change the natural order. We play Nova Terra for many reasons, but regardless of the reason, we should be able to play freely, without being tied to the struggle for power that others impose on us. \"If what you are saying is true, then, as someone with the power to ignore power games, it is my responsibility to make a place where no one has to worry about playing in the first place. Let's make a place where people can put down their burdens, where they don't have to fight for power or struggle for a place of their own. Let's make peace.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone! Are you interested in reading the rest of Book #3 and all of Book #4?

The Titan smiled down at his friend, the warm, confident look on his face leaving her slightly choked up. Lifting his gaze, Thorn stared into the distance, as if he could see beyond the fabric wall of the tent. After a moment of silence, he sighed and grinned.\"It's a nice idea anyway.\" Turning toward the doorway, he sighed again. \"I better get ahold of Corvo.\"\"You can do it!\" Velin blurted out suddenly, her eyes fixed on Thorn's broad back. Her eyes met his, as he looked over his shoulder, startled by her abrupt outburst. The Elven War Priestess was just as startled as Thorn and blushed furiously, spinning around so he could not see her bright red face. Unfortunately, her long ears were also bright red, betraying her embarrassment. With a chuckle, Thorn walked out of the tent to spare her further panic, but in his heart he vowed at that moment to complete this new goal. Back in the tent, Baxby was grinning, his smile stretching from ear to ear. Wiggling his eyebrows at the still blushing Elf, he teased her.\"Ah, to be young. Haha.\" He cackled as her face took on a deeper red. \"But believe me, lass, there are worse people you could follow. You've made a good choice. I've seen enough in my lifetime to know that this kid is going places. You can trust yourself to him. Honestly, listening to him talk almost makes me want to do the same.\"\"Why don't you do the same, sir?\" Velin asked, bringing her emotions back under control. \"We could use someone with your incredible skill.\"\"I told you, girl, cut it out with the sirs. I don't get into that sort of thing. And thanks but no thanks. I don't mind hanging out with you, but I've had enough of organized groups.\"\"If you change your mind, you are always welcome.\"\"Hah, thanks.\" Uncomfortable with the way Velin was looking at him, Baxby changed the subject. \"Now that we've picked up the three stone keys, my guess is that the second half of the Dwarven earth map is the last piece we need to figure out the labyrinth.\"\"Barring any accidents, we should get it tomorrow.\"\"Good. Once we do, I'll need to come with you into the dungeon. Just remember that you'll be down one combatant. I don't fight, so you'll have to carry my dead weight around.\"\"No problem. You are not the only one in that position. Oberlin will be coming with us, as well, and he is completely useless in a direct fight.\" More than happy the conversation had turned away from her embarrassing moment, Velin flipped open her notebook and began to grill Baxby on what he had learned about the three stone keys.Outside the tent, Thorn sat on his new rock as he called Corvo. The conversation with Velin had started his mind whirring and thoughts were beginning to form, though they had not yet crystallized. \"Hey, boss. How is it going?\" Corvo's face appeared in the messenger window. \"Good, we've finished collecting the three stone keys we need and will be trading dwarven maps with the Eastern Alliance tomorrow. I just wanted to check in to see how Jora Silverhand and the rest of the merchants were doing. Any word from their organization?\"\"You mean the ULM? Haha, sort of. For a United League of Merchants, they are not very united. We have gotten three different offers from small factions inside the league that want to cut a deal to work with us exclusively.\"\"Are you serious? Won't that harm their relationship with the rest of the league?\"\"They all want to deal under the table.\" Corvo grinned scornfully. \"I did some research on Ms. Silverhand and figured out what is going on. She is running for a seat on the council of the league. To get voted on, she has to make a big move that brings a certain amount of business to the organization. Seems she is in a bit of a hurry, which is why she was trying to be so forceful.\"The groups contacting us are all competing factions within the league that don't want to see her get the seat. However, I am happy to report that we have a better option than using the ULM. You know how you let Elder Havva oversee the valley? Well, we better pray that he doesn't want your job, because he organized the Wolfkin and humans in Greymane village, and they have already sent out three caravans.\"\"It's only been three days.\"\"Yeah. Like I said, pray he doesn't want your job. The Wolfkin natives do everything he says without question, and he got players to act as guards by giving them a quest. Highly efficient.\"\"Do you think they'll bring in enough supplies for the time being?\"\"For the short term? Yes. But long term, we need actual merchants who have good supply channels until we can build out the Night Walker's merchant arm.\"\"I see.\" Thorn rubbed his forehead as he tried to get his head around the problem. \"What are you estimating the time frame will look like? Are we talking two weeks? A few months?\"\"A month if we rush it. Three if we want something solid.\" \"Alright. See if you can rope Ms. Silverhand into the Night Walkers as a merchant to help head up that division.\"\"Really? You hardly know her. In fact, your only interaction with her so far was her threatening you. Aren't you afraid of being betrayed?\" Corvo's eyes narrowed as he stared at Thorn thoughtfully.\"I did some threatening of my own. Besides, you would have told me if there were any major red flags, right?\" Thorn grinned. \"She might have come to threaten us, but ultimately, she wants power, so let's play her game. As long as we can give her the authority that she was looking for in the ULM council, why would she betray us? If we can leverage her knowledge, expertise, and connections, we should be able to cut down on how long it takes to set up our own merchant arm, right? And if she gets out of line, I'll deal with it.\"\"What happened?\" \"What do you mean?\" Thorn's head tilted slightly as he looked at Corvo.\"Something changed. The way you are talking is way more decisive than normal. I know you were on a kick to be proactive, but this is different. More... scheming.\"\"Is it bad?\"\"Oh, no. It is great.\" The avatar of Huginn shook his head and chuckled. \"I'm all for scheming, and Josey will be happy about it, as well. It just took me by surprise.\"\"It was something Velin said.\" Thorn scratched the back of his head. \"Something about responsibility.\"\"And power plays?\"\"How did you know?\" Surprised, Thorn looked up, staring directly at Corvo's image.\"All-Seeing Raven, remember? You are the protector, I know everything.\" Corvo's picture flashed with a self-satisfied grin as he signed off, leaving Thorn staring at a black screen.\"That little...\" Thorn trailed off into a mumble. Shaking his head, he stood up and stretched, putting his boulder seat away. He had still not quite figured out his fellow avatars, but he had to admit that he was glad to have them as companions and not enemies. The rest of the day passed quietly as Thorn repaired his armor and got in some physical training. The habits of his life before Nova Terra and the benefits training had on his class made him devote time each day to practice his martial arts. Increasingly, Thorn found himself gravitating towards a hybrid unarmed combat style that used his claws to their fullest extent. Still, he was loathe to give up the sheer power of his tetsubo, so he kept up his practice with it.Early the next morning, the Titan squad gathered to enter the dungeon. Just like Diving mode, Exploration allowed a maximum of fifty people to enter as a team, so a few of the Titan squad members stayed behind so that Velin and Baxby could come along. Oberlin joined them, as well, just in case his talents would come in handy.Once she arrived, Velin flipped open her notebook and pulled Thorn, Seven Twisted Leaves, and Baxby aside. Looking them over carefully to make sure they were properly geared up, she nodded.\"Okay, Thorn, you'll be leading this team. Baxby will be our navigator, Leaves will be second in command. I am acting as advisor. Chain of command is Thorn, Leaves, me, and then the team leads.\"\"What about Baxby?\" Thorn looked at the treasure hunter, who grimaced.\"Thorn, don't interrupt.\" Velin shot a cold glance at the Titan before continuing. \"Baxby is our pathfinder, so he cannot be part of the chain of command. As I was saying. Command will pass when the current commander is incapacitated.\"\"So never,\" Seven Twisted Leaves quipped, poking Thorn in the shoulder and earning himself a glacial stare. Quailing under Velin's gaze, he put a hand over his mouth and mimed zipping it shut.\"Thank you. As I was saying.\" Velin paused and looked at the three men. Seeing that they were all quiet, she nodded to herself and continued. \"Our objective with this mission is to get to the location where the fire section and the air section connect. We will identify that as gate 1. There we will meet the Eastern Alliance. If everything goes to plan, we will make the trade for the dwarven earth map. From there, we will retreat. Yes, Thorn?\"\"How do we know the map is the right one?\" Thorn put down the hand that he had raised.\"That is where Baxby comes in. He will test the map for us and determine if it is the correct one. Once we have it in our hands, we will hopefully have a better idea of what the stone keys are used for.\"\"Okay, thanks.\"\"Any other questions? No? Then we should be all set to start. Thorn, you may lead the way.\"\"Great.\" Clapping his massive hands together, Thorn called over the rest of the Titan squad and led them into the dungeon. Selecting the exploration option from the popup, Thorn found himself once again in the now familiar beginning room. This time there was a doorway behind him that led out of the dungeon. Unlike Diving mode, which gave the party leader a token to let them teleport the group out when they were done, Exploration mode required them to either walk out or respawn.The labyrinth was not nearly as hot in Exploration mode, and taking care of the fire elementals along the way proved a simple matter, so they made good time as they headed for the meeting point. As they walked, Thorn had the opportunity to study the architecture in greater detail. He had noticed the strange discrepancy in the size of the rooms and decided to ask Baxby about it when he saw the treasure hunter looking at a faded mural.\"Do you know how old this city is?\" Walking over to stand next to Baxby, Thorn examined the mural.\"Older than me, which is a miracle.\" The old man chuckled. \"I would guess that this labyrinth was built before the Era of the Gods. See here? It looks like paint has been added over top of an older mural. That reddish color you see underneath? That is found at some of the oldest sites in Nova Terra.\" \"Oh? So wouldn't that mean that the Dwarves came later?\"\"Eh, it might. Some people think that the Dwarves were created by the gods, some people think that they were born from the earth. Who knows, really? It is almost impossible to figure out what happened such a long time ago unless Eve herself decides you should know.\"\"Good point.\" Looking around, Thorn gestured to the massive pillars running down the center of the hallway they were passing through. \"Isn't the scale strange, though? Why would Dwarves build something so out of scale?\"\"Maybe they didn't.\" Tracing his wrinkled hand over the fading paint of the mural, Baxby glanced up at the vaulted ceiling. \"Like I said, who knows why the ancients did what they did? Listen, kid. Just because something is one way now, doesn't mean that it has always been that way. Things change over time, but you can't always extrapolate backward. Culture and society shift, as does the natural world. It is best to keep an open mind if you want to dig into the secrets of history.\"\"Sorry to interrupt your chat, but we need to keep going. We are on a schedule.\" The rest of the group had stopped when they saw Thorn and Baxby chatting near the mural, so Velin walked over after a moment.\"Yes, ma'am.\" Thorn chuckled and snapped a sloppy salute. Waving for the Titan squad to follow him, Thorn walked through the massive doorway at the end of the hall.Over the next few hours, the group fought its way through small groups of fire elementals. The path they were taking was one that Baxby had drawn out, and it took them winding through countless rooms and corridors. Every once in a while the treasure hunter would stop the group and spend a few minutes searching around the room they had entered to, without fail, find a hidden chest.Oberlin, proving once again that his fingers were nearly magic, would casually open the locked chests, revealing the jewels, materials, or other loot hidden inside. Thorn was surprised at first when Baxby kept revealing hidden chests, but he soon grew numb to the old man's ability to sniff out a hidden treasure in a completely empty room. No matter how hard Thorn looked, there was never anything there, until Baxby moved a bit of stone or poked the shadow behind a pillar and the treasure chest popped into existence.The loot they gained from the treasure chests was added to the loot they picked up from the fire elementals they killed and divided between the members of the team. Baxby, unsurprisingly, was not interested in any of the loot, only taking a few of the smaller gems at Velin's insistence.After four hours of travel, the team finally arrived at the location of the trade. Calling for them to stop, Thorn gave everyone ten minutes to rest before they entered the long hallway where the trade would take place and called Jorge.\"What's up?\" The gruff voice of the Dwarven Shadow Assassin sounded by Thorn's hip. \"Can you help me out with something?\"\"Of course. You're the boss.\"\"Thanks.\" Sending Jorge a message, Thorn earned himself a quizzical look. Still, after reading over the message, the Dwarf nodded and disappeared in a puff of shadow.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

Dark stone walls with a reflected red tint stretched forward to the halfway mark where they were met by a white marble wall reflecting a wavy blue light that reminded Thorn of light shining into a pool. Standing at the edge of the blueish area was a group of fifty players, all dressed in high quality armor.Though their armor was not uniform, each player wore a similar green tabard with the winged shield symbol of the Eastern Alliance guild. At the front of the group, three players in blue tabards stood together, talking quietly. Seeing how good they looked in their matching tabards, Thorn glanced back at the Titan squad, who were dressed in whatever caught their fancy. The two guilds, though similar in combat power, looked worlds apart.Velin, noticing Thorn's look, flipped open her notebook and made a note to work on a uniform for Nova Luna. The guild had its own symbol, but they had not developed any sort of dress code for their members, causing them to look more like a random group of players than an organized team. Wearing a similar uniform would help with group cohesion and identification.As Thorn walked forward with Velin, Mina, and Baxby, the three blue tabarded players advanced to meet them. Walking in the center was a stunning human woman with jet-black hair and an olive complexion. Dressed in an impressive set of red armor with phoenix motifs on the pauldrons and carrying dual scimitars at her waist, she gave off a fiery impression. At six feet four inches, she was quite tall for a human, though still dwarfed by Thorn, and it was obvious from the proud look on her face that she was used to other player's eyes.Next to her was a mustached man with a staff and a shorter woman carrying a spear and a round shield. As they walked up to Thorn, all three of them had their eyes locked on his massive form. With his gleaming silver armor and his helm held under his arm, Thorn presented a striking picture.\"Hello. I'm Thorn, Baron Greymane, leader of Nova Luna. Are you BurningCloud?\" Lifting his hand in a small wave, Thorn did his best to be as non-threatening as possible. He wanted to make sure this trade went well.\"Hi, Thorn. Yes, I'm BurningCloud, the president of the Eastern Alliance. This is LemonLia, my second-in-command, and Forthil, the Eastern Alliance security director.\" Offering her hand for a handshake, BurningCloud gestured with her head to her companions. Looking them over now that they were closer, Thorn examined BurningCloud's companions. Forthil was a robed mage with long black hair who carried a shiny silver staff. On the other side, the spear carrying LemonLia flipped her chestnut brown hair over her shoulder as she stared at Thorn. \"Nice to meet you all. This is Velin, my advisor, and Baxby, our treasure hunting expert.\"After introductions were complete, BurningCloud gestured for LemonLia to get out the dwarven earth map that they were going to trade. Taking the orb from her second-in-command, BurningCloud tossed it up and down in her hand. Her smiling face took on a cunning look as she watched the three players from Nova Luna track the metal orb with their eyes. \"According to what I'm told, this little piece of metal is worth a lot to you. Is that so?\"His eyes narrowing slightly, Thorn's eyes swept the group of players from Eastern Alliance as he slowly straightened to his full height. A lazy smile crossed his face, and he shifted his impressive weight forward half an inch. Instantly his aura changed, going from relaxed and friendly to oppressive. Though he was still smiling, it was no longer the easy, open smile from before. Instead, all three of the players from Eastern Alliance felt like they had been targeted by a large predator.As if sensing the change in his body language, Velin started to lift her hand even before Thorn moved, but paused when she saw Thorn's smile. Without moving, Thorn suddenly seemed to be towering above BurningCloud, his deep blue eyes staring down at her.\"You are correct.\" Thorn's deep voice, so calm and soothing before, was suddenly heavy. \"It is worth a lot to me.\"\"Ah.\" It took all of her mental strength for BurningCloud to stop herself from stepping backward under the weight of Thorn's aura. As the leader of the second strongest guild in Nova Terra, she was not used to backing down for anyone, but she had also never encountered this level of presence in a player. As she did her best to resist the brunt of Thorn's aura, the smile slid from her face.Next to her, LemonLia was handling the pressure with composure, though her white knuckled grip on her long spear revealed the stress she was feeling. The black haired Forthil, on the other hand, was completely cowed by Thorn's presence. Trembling slightly, the mage retreated a few steps, his chest heaving as he tried to breath. The silence only lasted a brief moment, but to everyone standing there, except Thorn, it felt like it dragged on for an eternity. \"Well, I'm glad we can help you.\" As if she suddenly came to a decision, BurningCloud flashed a bright smile at Thorn and took a trembling step forward with the dwarven earth map held out in front of her. Her smile lit up her face like a thousand flowers blooming, making her look like an angel in her red phoenix armor. Bemused, Thorn could only stare down at her curiously. Nodding affably, the Titan retracted his aura so that BurningCloud could approach him. Once his overpowering presence disappeared, both LemonLia and Forthil breathed a secret sigh of relief, and BurningCloud laughed softly as she walked closer to Thorn. \"Oh, I'm happy you could help us, as well.\" Thorn pulled the dwarven earth map they had agreed to trade from his inventory and rolled it around like a marble. As he was about to hand it over to the beautiful leader of Eastern Alliance, a cough came from behind him, and Velin stepped forward, plucking the dwarven earth map from his large hand.\"Ehem, excuse me.\" Velin's voice was polite, but Thorn knew her well enough to tell that she was annoyed for some reason. With her other hand, she gently pushed against Thorn's chest, causing him to take a small step backward. Not short herself, Velin seemed to stand straighter than normal as she faced off against the beautiful leader of Eastern Alliance.\"Haha, now that is a pleasant sight, huh, kid?\" Cackling, Baxby elbowed Thorn as he pointed toward the Elven War Priestess and BurningCloud. The two women did present a pretty image as they stood together, Velin's cold elegance contrasting with BurningCloud's passionate force.Coming to a stop within half an arms length of Velin, BurningCloud examined her closely, running her eyes up and down the Elf's slim figure. Velin matched her stare for stare, not giving an inch. The tension that had just drained from the scene reappeared as neither woman spoke. Finally, after looking thoughtfully between Thorn and Velin, BurningCloud's smile grew even sweeter, and she giggled.\"Protective, aren't we? Still, I can see why. What do you say, shall we trade?\"If Thorn had been looking very closely, he might have caught the hint of red that sprang to Velin's cheeks at BurningCloud's words, but as it was, he was too busy trying to figure out why the two women were standing so close together.\"Of course. That's why we are here, after all. Here you go.\" Velin's tone was cold as she held out the dwarven earth map she had taken from Thorn's hand. BurningCloud held out her hand as well, and both women simultaneously reached for the orb held by the other woman. Behind Velin, Thorn tensed slightly as he watched the exchange, ready to charge into action at a moment's notice should he detect any sort of foul play.It was not until Velin took a step back, the trade complete, that Thorn relaxed. He was about to take the dwarven earth map from her but the War Priestess handed it to Baxby first. Flipping it over a couple of times, Baxby examined it closely for a few minutes before nodding.\"It's the real deal, alright. We got the right one.\"\"Don't you have to turn it on?\" Thorn whispered, looking down at the inert chunk of metal.\"Nah, when you rotate the plates, it shows you what sections of the labyrinth it covers. Its those runic symbols down there.\" Baxby pointed to a tiny row of incomprehensible symbols.\"Uh, sure. If you say so.\" Thorn had no idea what the symbols meant, so he just shrugged and patted the treasure hunter on the shoulder. Velin and BurningCloud were still facing off, though they were no longer standing so close together now that the trade had been completed. \"So, what are these things, anyway?\" BurningCloud tossed the orb Velin had just given her up and down in her hand. \"We've done just about everything, but we cannot figure it out.\"Before speaking, Velin glanced at Thorn, who nodded. It had been part of the agreement to explain the Dwarven earth map's function anyway, so there was little reason to conceal the information now.\"They are maps to the labyrinth. You have to get two of them in order to unlock the full map. We just traded you one of the air maps, but you will have to hunt for the other yourself. Each map activates when you bring it to the correct section, which is why you could not figure out what they were.\"\"Oh, wow. Talk about bad luck.\" BurningCloud smiled wryly. \"I guess what you are saying is that we should have asked for more from you. Hey, relax. We already made the trade, and we won't take it back. Well, I hope it helps you.\"\"Thank you.\" Walking over to stand beside Velin, Thorn nodded to BurningCloud, his gentle smile back. \"This will be a great help to us. Nova Luna will remember this favor.\"\"Its nothing, so long as you remember it.\" BurningCloud giggled again as her eyes slowly scanned Thorn. Covering her mouth with her hand, the guild leader of Eastern Alliance turned away and led her two companions back toward the Eastern Alliance team, leaving a puzzled Titan and a fuming Elf behind.\"Let's go.\" Under her cold expression, Thorn could tell that Velin was boiling. Or at least simmering. Shooting a curious glance at her as they walked back to the Titan squad, he considered asking if something was wrong. Eventually deciding to let her calm down first, Thorn ordered the Titan squad to move out, leading them back the way they had come.Winding their way through the dungeon as they walked toward the entrance, everyone was in a good mood. Even Velin stifled whatever was bothering her and joined in the conversation. So far, it had been a smooth trip. Thorn had half expected to have to fight Eastern Alliance for the Dwarven earth map, but they had turned out to be much more compliant than he had anticipated.*ding* The friend request revealed BurningCloud's class and her highest ranked title, giving Thorn even greater respect for her. Not only was she the second most powerful guild leader in Nova Terra, but she had a triple category class. On top of all of that, even the game recognized her good looks, an amazing feat considering that the system allowed for a 20 percent improvement. Without knowing why, Thorn glanced at Velin out of the corner of his eye only to find her staring directly at him. Startled, he stopped walking and met her gaze. Behind them, the whole Titan squad stopped, looking around in confusion. After a moment of staring, Velin snapped out of her thoughts and continued walking as if the strange pause had never happened.Looking after her, Thorn was about to open his mouth when he thought better of it again. Having lived with Athena for sixteen years before he began to play Nova Terra, he was well versed in dealing with mood swings and had learned that sometimes it was safer to just stay quiet. Resolving to talk to Velin later, he waved his confused guildmates forward and followed after Velin. The blinking friend request caught his attention once again, and he casually tapped the button to accept it. After traveling for about half an hour, Baxby, who was walking in front of the group with Thorn, suddenly slowed down. The team was just about to enter a large room with a massive open furnace along one wall that spawned fire elementals at regular intervals when he brought everyone to a stop.\"Something the matter?\" \"Shhhh.\" Holding his finger to his lips, Baxby looked around at the room. A smattering of fire elementals had respawned since they passed by the first time, and looking over the room, Thorn could not spot any issues. Scratching his head, Thorn looked at Velin, who shrugged her shoulders.\"Did you find something?\"\"If I did, it is nothing good.\" Baxby peered around from under his thick eyebrows. \"This room smells dangerous.\"\"Uh. Like a trap or something? We cleared it without trouble on the way over here, so there shouldn't be anything we haven't seen.\"\"No, this is different. Someone else has been here.\"\"How can you tell?\" Thorn examined the floor closely, looking for footprints. Unable to find anything, he looked at the old treasure hunter again. \"I mean, it is not that I don't believe you, but this is the way we get out of here.\"\"I'm telling you, this is dangerous. My danger sense is tingling.\"\"You have a sixth sense?\"\"I don't know about sixth, but it certainly is a sense.\" Baxby, unable to actually spot any problems, started to take a step forward and then froze, slowly retracting his outstretched leg. \"[Prescient Avoidance]. It has kept me alive more times than you can count. Perk of having gone through so many types of deadly danger in my life. This room is bad news.\" \"Do we have another path?\" \"Nah. Not if we want to leave from where we came in. This is a choke point. We could go around to the water section of the labyrinth, but that exit will drop us far away from the mine where we came in. No, our only real option is walking through.\"His face turning serious, Thorn buckled on his helmet when he heard Baxby's words. If there was no way around the room, it meant cutting their way through whatever danger the treasure hunter was sensing.\"Suit up, folks. We might have trouble ahead.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone! Are you interested in reading the rest of Book #3 and all of Book #4?

Cautiously, they followed Thorn as he advanced into the room, his tetsubo held ready. Not taking any chances, Thorn ordered three tanks to come with him, the four of them going out ahead of the group to tank the fire elementals. Soon the fire elementals fell to the ground, crushed by the focused attacks of the group, and the Titan squad was left standing in the middle of the room. \"Let's move, folks. No reason to dawdle here.\" The giant gaping furnace on the team's right was making Thorn nervous. \"Uh oh.\"\"That doesn't sound good.\" Hearing Baxby's voice, Thorn followed the old man's gaze toward the doorway the team was headed for, coming to rest on twenty-five players with gleaming silver armor. Snapping his head around, Thorn could see more silver-armored players walking out of the doorway the team had just come from, trapping the Titan squad neatly in the middle. \"Uh oh is right.\"The flickering orange light cascading from the giant furnace cast a malevolent gleam on the silver armor of the approaching Silver Guard. Stretched across both entrances into the room, the team from Ragnarok had come prepared for war. Each Silver Guard held a tall kite shield in front of them, creating a solid wall of metal between the Titan squad and the exits.Slowly the Silver Guard closed in, maintaining their perfect ranks, only stopping when they were forty feet away. With a shout, all of the Silver Guard lifted their shields and drove the pointed ends into the stone floor.*CRACK*With a loud sound, the shields sank a few inches into the floor, sending a cloud of dust and stone chips into the air. Tightly packed together in the center, the Titan squad shifted nervously as the dust blew over them. Standing head and shoulders above the rest of the team, Thorn stood like a solid mountain, unmoving as he scanned the Silver Guard, looking for Sylith.As the dust cleared, the shields of the Silver Guard came into view, silver light coursing over them. Evenly spaced, the shields stuck into the stone floor pulsed with energy, creating an ephemeral wall of illusory kite shields that stretched the whole way across the room. Next to Thorn, Velin paled.\"Uh oh is right.\" Mina unconsciously repeated Thorn's words from moments before, her eyes wide as she stared at the barrier. \"This is trouble.\"\"I knew something was wrong.\" Baxby spit on the stone, his saliva boiling as it hit the hot floor.\"What is that?\" Thorn had drawn his tetsubo and pointed it at the shield.\"That, friend, is the [Invulnerable Silver Aegis].\" From the entrance at Thorn's back the familiar gold and purple armored figure of Sylith appeared. Walking casually forward until he was right behind the line of Silver Guard, he patted one of his men on the shoulder, the clanging ring of metal grating in the Titan squad's ears.\"Invulnerable, huh?\" Thorn's voice was heavy as he turned around to face Sylith. About to take a step forward, he felt Velin's hand on his arm.\"Don't be hasty, Thorn.\" The Elven War Priestess had a serious expression on her face.\"Yeah, Thorn. Don't be hasty.\" Sylith grinned mockingly. \"Besides, now that we're both here and you can't go anywhere, how about we have a little chat?\"\"What would we have to chat about, Sylith?\" Taking a deep breath, Thorn forcibly calmed himself down, stifling the burning desire in his chest that was telling him to throw himself at the enemy with abandon. \"You know, I've always felt like we were never able to have a real, honest, man to man conversation before.\" Oblivious to Thorn's struggle, Sylith spoke casually. \"Our discussions have been so rushed and under pressure. So I thought it would be nice to arrange some time to chat.\"\"You could have just called.\"\"Haha, funny. You know, that is what I like about you. Your humor. Oh, and your naive optimism. That is quite the endearing quality, as well. If only you could get rid of your annoying habits, you might even be pretty tolerable. What do you say we have a discussion, Thorn?\"\"Huh. You trailed us into a dungeon and trapped us here to throw weak insults at me?\" Thorn's eyebrows rose under his helmet. \"Even if you don't have better things to do, Sylith, Nova Luna does. Please move aside.\"\"See, that is what I am talking about.\" Grimacing dramatically, Sylith shook a finger at Thorn. \"This is one of your annoying habits. You don't listen. No, I didn't come here to 'throw weak insults'. I came here to talk. But in a proper forum. See, after meeting you, I realized something. You're used to being a bully, Thorn. You have strength and size, and you don't hesitate to throw them around when you are faced with something, or someone, you don't like. Just like a wild dog, snapping at everything around them.\"Tell me, Thorn, how do you go about dealing with a wild dog? Don't worry, I'll tell you.\" Holding his hand up to keep Thorn from speaking, Sylith chuckled. \"If you want to deal with a wild dog, you have to restrain it first. There is a reason humans invented collars and leashes, you know. If you don't want to get bit, you start with a chain and maybe a beating or two. If that doesn't work, you move on to a muzzle.\"\"Done yet?\" \"No, why would I be done?\" Sylith cocked his head to the side. \"I've got all the time in the world to chat with you now. The [Invulnerable Silver Aegis] is, as it is named, invulnerable, silver, and an aegis. You can see that it is silver, and as for being an aegis...\"\"It's a shield, I get it.\" Ignoring Thorn's interruption, Sylith just grinned all the wider.\"An aegis, is a shield. That brings us to the last, but obviously most important point in this explanation, doesn't it? The [Invulnerable Silver Aegis] is, at its core, invulnerable. That means that it cannot be broken. It is impervious to damage or harm. That is straight out of the dictionary, you know.\"\"Is he normally this talkative?\" Thorn leaned down to speak in Velin's ear.\"No, something else is going on.\"\"Alright, keep your eyes open.\" Straightening back up, Thorn waited for Sylith, who was still prattling on about how impressive the wall of energy was, to take a breath. \"I get it. The wall is tough. Get to the point, Sylith. What do you want?\"\"What do I want? Why don't we talk about what you have?\"\"Here we go,\" Mina muttered under her breath. \"This the the Sylith we're familiar with.\"\"That is being a bit greedy, don't you think?\" Thorn tightened his grip on the handle of his tetsubo.\"No, I don't think so.\" Sylith shook his head. \"I like to think of it as realistic. You and your team are going to die, from natural causes I might add, and I am going to be here to collect that map that you just traded from Eastern Alliance. If we can come to an agreement, you can walk free. You'll have to leave the map, of course, but compared to losing the map and dying as well, I think it is the better deal.\"\"How did you...\"\"Find out about the map? Please, Thorn. You can't be silly enough to think that you are the only one with an information network? Regardless of how we found out, here we are.\"The Silver Guard maintained their vigilant state, each of the silver-armored players holding their planted shield steadily. Even though they were taking no aggressive actions, the pressure they exuded just by standing there was starting to wear on the Titan squad. Thorn could sense the fidgeting behind him as his team tried to keep their composure. Realizing that the situation was starting to deteriorate, Thorn turned to Velin. \"What are the chances we can break out of here?\"\"Next to none. The [Invulnerable Silver Aegis] is exactly what it sounds like. They can't move, or attack, but it is impossible to get through from this side.\"\"Have you tried before?\" \"I haven't, but I've seen other people try, and nothing can get through it.\"\"Well,\" Thorn drew his arbalest and leveled it at Sylith's head. \"Let's try it out.\"Sylith stood unmoving, a slight smile on his face as he stared at the massive bolt Thorn had pointed at him. With a whoosh, the bolt shot through the air, covering the forty feet almost instantly. Even with all their training, the two Silver Guard closest to the path of the bolt could not help but flinch as it approached. Driving into the ethereal wall, the bolt's metal head detonated, sending shards of steel and wood rebounding. The bolt had been moving with such a speed that it seemed to disintegrate in mid-air as it impacted on the wall. Sylith, watching the bolt hit, broke into a full grin.\"It's a good try, but you'll need more than that to break this shield.\"\"Is it only me, or is his voice really annoying?\" Thorn asked Velin as he tightened his grip on his tetsubo.\"It is really annoying.\"Even knowing that his attack was going to be useless, Thorn still had to try. LIfting his tetsubo, he walked forward, his heavy footsteps causing the ground to tremble. Soon he was standing in front of the [Invulnerable Silver Aegis], little more than an arm's reach away from the Silver Guard. Cracking his neck, Thorn took a deep breath and patted the barrier. Unlike what he expected, the barrier had no give whatsoever. Normally, the things he touched moved, even if only a little, but patting this thin pane of energy was like patting a mountain. Reconsidering, Thorn stood quietly for a moment as he tried to calculate how much force it would take to crack the barrier open. On the other side of the barrier, despite knowing that Thorn's attack would never make it through, the Silver Guard player held his breath. Finally, with a glance at Sylith, Thorn walked back over to the Titan squad and spoke to Velin in a low voice.\"You were right. Nothing is going through that.\"\"At this point, there is not much we can do except wait.\" Velin frowned. \"The problem is, the [Invulnerable Silver Aegis] doesn't require that much energy, so it can last a long time.\"\"Isn't that completely overpowered? How can it be okay that they get such a broken ability?\"\"Are you serious?\" Velin rolled her eyes at Thorn, wiping a trickle of sweat from her forehead. \"The shield is impervious, but only from one direction. It is extremely fragile from the other side. Any sort of disruption will bring it down. It also isn't that big. It is only really effective in a choke point since the guard who activates it cannot move or it will collapse.\"\"So we're at an impasse? Whoever gets tired first?\"\"Sort of. Attacks cannot pass through the aegis. Any attacks from that side will weaken it until the whole shield crumbles. They can't attack us, but attacks are not the danger. The ability divides space. Anything in here cannot pass over there.\" \"So what is the point of all of this? Why not just wipe us out? Aren't the Silver Guard supposed to be really good at team fights?\"\"They are. The Silver Guard are arguably the best team fighters in the game. Even more so when they have Sylith leading them. But if they attack us, they'll be marked by the system and they will have broken the agreement that we made. So, instead, they'll just use the environment to kill us. After all, if we die without them lifting a hand, they will be able to argue that it was not their fault.\"\"Sorry, I'm not following.\" It was obvious from Thorn's tone of voice that he was completely lost.Mutely, Velin simply raised her hand and pointed at the fiercely burning furnace that dominated one wall. Staring at it blankly for a minute, Thorn still didn't get it until a bead of sweat rolled down his cheek.\"Uh oh.\"On the other side of the shimmering barrier of shields, Sylith saw Velin's raised hand and laughed.\"Like I said, natural causes.\" Rubbing his hands together, he grinned. \"When we first started using this ability, we quickly realized that the [Invulnerable Silver Aegis] has an interesting property. Temperature isolation. I am sure that this is designed to help defend against things like frost breath or fireballs. Not only does it block the pure force but the elemental affect, as well.\"Unfortunately for you, this means you're between a rock and a hard place. Ha, maybe I should have said, a rock and a hot place. What a missed opportunity! Ah well, you probably don't have time for appreciating jokes right now. Where was I? Oh, right. Complete immunity to elemental affects. For me, that means staying quite cool. Or, at least, as cool as I can be in this dungeon. \"For you, it means something different. Feel the sweat yet? I can tell that your friends do. I'm interested to see how long you'll be able to last in there with the amount of heat being pumped out by that furnace.\"His mind racing furiously, Thorn stared at the flame-belching furnace. Heat was rolling out of the mouth of the furnace in waves, the temperature warping the air. Trapped between the two barriers, the constant infusion of heat was beginning to cause the ambient temperature to creep up steadily. Soon, Thorn felt like he was back in the Diving mode dungeon surrounded by crowds of fire elementals. As he was watching, a fiery figure materialized out of the flame, floating forward toward the team, burning fireballs resting in its hands. \"Incoming!\"\"Fire elemental!\"Shouts broke out among the players from Nova Luna as they rushed to kill the floating fire elemental. Countless attacks hammered it into the ground almost as soon as it appeared. The fire elemental was crushed, releasing a small explosion of lava as it died, the molten rock splashing on the ground. Feeling the temperature jump noticeably, Thorn, Velin, and Mina all exchanged glances.On top of pumping out heat, the furnace was releasing fire elementals every few minutes. Elite fire elementals only spawned when the temperature in the room rose to a specific point, which normally meant that a certain number of regular elementals would spawn before any elite fire elementals. Unfortunately, the area the Titan squad was standing in would soon reach the required temperature because of the two barriers trapping them.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

For some reason, her normally even emotions had been jumping wildly recently, making it difficult for her to talk to Thorn. Gathering herself, she opened her eyes and looked squarely at Thorn without backing down an inch.\"I mean the dwarven earth maps are not worth dying over. It'll take me a couple minutes to copy them out, and then we can just use that map. The only thing that will happen if we give away the orbs is they'll be able to figure out the path faster. Ragnarok will still need to clear the big groups of elementals, which I doubt they've done. But if we die, we're giving them a leg up. That is twenty-four hours that they are free to progress, while we have to wait.\"\"But those maps are ours.\" Even though Thorn was wearing a helmet, those close to him could hear his teeth grinding. \"At the very least, we should make them pay.\"\"What do you mean pay?\" Baxby jumped in. \"We can't get out. We're just going to sit here until we all die from exhaustion. Listen, kid, I know you are tough, but know when to take a step back. Sometimes you have to admit that you've been out-maneuvered and just go with the flow.\"\"Baxby is right.\" Velin's voice was quiet, and she held her staff nervously in front of her. \"We will gain more by letting this go. Besides, even if we can get out of here, can we take on a full squad of Silver Guard in a fight? You've seen Sylith in action. He might be annoying, but he is a quad category class holder. He isn't to be taken lightly. Especially when he is with the Silver Guard.\"\"No way.\" Thorn's voice was hard enough to sever iron. \"He can take the map over my dead body.\"\"This...\" Velin looked at Mina for help, but before the Ice Witch could help persuade Thorn, the Titan's voice sounded again.\"This is non-negotiable. We are not handing anything over.\" Not bothering to keep his voice quiet, Thorn's words carried around the room, causing everyone to freeze. \"Ragnarok will not get a penny while we are still alive. No one takes what belongs to Nova Luna without a fight.\"\"Haha, you sure about that?\" Unbothered by Thorn's hardline stance, Sylith's tone was just as flippant as before.\"Yes. Titan squad, get ready to attack on my signal. Baxby, we'll buy you some time. Use it to copy out the maps.\" Thorn took two orbs out of his inventory and handed them over to the treasure hunter.\"Thorn...\"\"I said get ready to attack.\" Ignoring what Velin was trying to say, Thorn strode to the front of the group. Looking helplessly at his broad back, Velin wanted to speak but could not find the words. Drops of sweat beaded her forehead as the furnace continued to belch out heat. It was true that something had to be done, or they would fall prey to the rising temperature, but trying to fight against an unbreakable shield would only speed up their demise.The players surrounding them slowly began to move to their positions, sweat trickling down their faces. The furnaces were beginning to get so hot that the group had to take a step back, distancing themselves from the rolling heat. Velin glanced around at the sweat-drenched players. Thorn was right in one regard. If nothing was done soon, the rising temperature would start claiming lives. \"Just do what he says, young lady.\" Baxby patted her on the shoulder. Crouching down, he unrolled the large map of the dungeon and set up the two orbs on the sides. \"When young people like him get something in their head, arguing with them is futile. He'll have to learn the hard way. The only thing you can do at this point is support him.\"\"But that will get us all killed!\" Trying to whisper, Velin's words came out as a hiss.\"Sure, you know that and I know that. We all know that, but he doesn't. So what are you going to do? Disobey his orders so he can blame you for the loss later? Sorry, that ain't helpful. Follow your orders, and you won't get hosed later.\" As he spoke, Baxby's hands never stopped moving as he traced new lines on the map. \"Besides, Mr. Miracle Maker over there might be able to pull something out. You never know.\"With another deep sigh, Velin took one last look at Thorn's back before slowly taking her place with the other support players. Mina, who had been quiet this whole time, gave her a concerned look. Oblivious to the conversation behind him, Thorn stood facing Sylith, glaring at the Ragnarok leader as if his eyes could burn straight through him. Behind Thorn, the Titan squad assembled into combat formation. The tanks took the front, standing behind Thorn, while the DPS classes split into two flanks, surrounding the healers and other support. Baxby stayed in the back, working on the map with Oberlin next to him. Once everyone had taken their place, Thorn ordered the whole group to move forward, heading toward the center of the Silver Guard line where Sylith stood. The squad of Silver Guard behind the Titan squad could not move forward because, if they did, the [Invulnerable Silver Aegis] they were supporting would collapse. This left only half of the Silver Guard facing Thorn and the Titan squad. Lifting his tetsubo, Thorn stared at the Silver Guard player who was standing seventh from the end of the line.\"We'll break through there. On my command, throw all attacks at that spot. Melee, move up with me.\" Thorn took his time arranging his team, since the Silver Guard could not move. Once everyone was in place, he looked over at the gloating Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight, who was watching. \"You are going to regret this.\"\"See, I don't think I am. I think you will regret this. Persisting in this foolishness despite the good advice you're getting will leave you with no one to blame but yourself. I mean, don't kid yourself, we could wipe you out without needing to resort to this if we wanted to. I just don't want to get my hands dirty.\"Turning his head slightly, Thorn glanced at Velin, who nodded mutely. \"He's right, you know.\" Seeing that Velin was not speaking, Mina chimed in. \"The Silver Guard are, hands down, the toughest group in the game. In a straight fight, we will lose. I know that, Velin knows it, everyone here knows it except for you.\"Hearing the seriousness of Mina's tone, Thorn's heart wavered. He did not believe that the girls would lie to him, but for some reason, he felt unable to back down. Clenching his teeth under his helmet, he turned back and looked at the [Invulnerable Silver Aegis] stretching out in front of him. He had just bragged that he was going to take down the Silver Guard and it stung that Velin and Mina lacked confidence in him. And it was not just them. Baxby and the rest of the team were obviously skeptical that they could win, as well.As much as he did not want to admit it, maybe it would be better to just take a step back at this point. Reaching out, Thorn rested his fingers lightly on the barrier. Part of him wanted to open his mouth and back down, but the words kept getting stuck in his chest. It was as if there was a war in his heart, as if he was two different people, each fighting for control. The girls were probably right, fighting was not the correct choice in this situation. Even though he had not seen the Silver Guard fight against other players, he had watched them clear the legions of stone dwarves when they were assaulting the fortress. Their discipline was top notch, and the collective ability of a group of Silver Guard was rather terrifying. It did not take a genius to see that the Titan squad would probably be outmatched in a fight.Still, Thorn was not one to give up. The girls said they would lose, but they had thought that he died when they sacrificed him to Karrandras and left him for dead. They had underestimated him then, and he was sure they were underestimating him again. Why should he give up just because other people said so? Apart from the mistake when he fought Angdrin and his Crimson Snake goons at the entrance to the mine, Thorn had not lost a fight since coming to Nova Terra. Maybe his strength could carry the day here, as well.Hardening his resolve, Thorn's fingers tapped against the [Invulnerable Silver Aegis], making a sharp clicking sound as his metal claws hit the immovable wall. They would at least give it a try. Behind him, as if sensing his resolve, the Titan squad seemed to straighten up. The looks of concern and worry faded from their faces, replaced by unity of purpose. After all, the worst thing that could happen was that they would lose twenty-four hours of game time.\"We are going to attack here.\" Thorn pointed to the Silver Guard player on the other side of the [Invulnerable Silver Aegis]. \"Haha, can't wait to see how that works out for you,\" Sylith mocked from where he stood in the middle of the Silver Guard line.\"Basic attacks first. Attack on three.\"The players of the Titan squad gripped their weapons tightly, their eyes fixed on the spot where Thorn had pointed.\"One. Two. Three.\"As soon as the words slipped from Thorn's lips, an overwhelming number of attacks flashed forward from the group as the whole squad swung their weapons. Bolts of energy mixed with arrows shot past Thorn, smashing into the [Invulnerable Silver Aegis]. At the same moment, the melee players stepped forward, driving their weapons into the wall with all their might.Despite knowing that the shield was impossible for them to break, every member of the Titan squad threw everything into the attack, striking with as much strength as they could muster. Despite their best efforts, the [Invulnerable Silver Aegis] held, the impact of all of the Titan squad's weapons causing nothing more than a ripple on the energy wall that quickly died down.\"Hahaha!\" As he watched Thorn count down, there had even been a brief moment when the leader of the Silver Guard was worried that the [Invulnerable Silver Aegis] would buckle under the combined might of the Titan squad. That worry was quickly blown away when reality proved otherwise. Joining him in laughter, the Silver Guard relaxed slightly, joking among themselves.Unperturbed, Thorn commanded another attack, and once again the Titan squad threw their attacks forward, hammering against the wall. This time, Thorn held back, his eyes watching the rippling effect the attacks caused on the shield. Around him, many players were panting as the heat began to take its toll. When they had not been doing anything, the heat had been bearable, but now that they were attacking, they could feel it draining their endurance much faster than at rest.\"Attack again.\" Thorn's words were short, and the squad mechanically swung their weapons. Again, their attacks hammered into the wall, only to disappear as if they had never existed. As focused as he was, Thorn could feel a slight tinge of helplessness settling on the players around him. It was not yet so strong that he would call it despair, but he knew that, with the combination of futile attacks and the searing heat, the little feeling of helplessness would soon turn into despair.\"Give up!\"\"You're going to die anyway, so why are you struggling?\"\"Just give it a rest, and drop your gear already.\"The shouts from across the barrier did not help the situation, only lending to the sense of helplessness among the Titan squad. Normally, this level of trash talk, a common feature among competing guilds, would not affect the players of Nova Luna in the slightest. This time, though, combined with the draining heat and the ineffectual attacks Thorn was ordering, the words stung a bit more than normal. \"Thorn...\" Looking at the Titan, Velin's normally impassive face was creased with worry.\"Attack again. On three.\"As Thorn's hard words echoed around the chamber, even Baxby sat up slightly, a deep frown on his face. The leader of Nova Luna enjoyed a good reputation among the members of the guild, and most of them followed him with perfect willingness, but he was beginning to enter dangerous territory. It did not take much for a leader to lose the respect of their subordinates, and when they did, it marked the end of whatever organization they led. By repeatedly commanding his team to exhaust themselves with fruitless attacks, Thorn was treading on thin ice. Baxby's experienced eyes could spot the signs of frustration starting to bloom among the members of the Titan squad. Not wanting to see Thorn throw away what he had worked so hard for, Baxby stood and was about to speak when his right eyelid twitched and he froze. Crouching back down, he began to work feverishly on the map.\"One.\"Sylith's mocking smile grew wider as he spotted the cracks beginning to appear in the demeanor of the Titan squad's players. As a guild leader, he was exceptionally sensitive to public opinion, and he could see it starting to swing against Thorn, which made him ecstatic. His goal today had originally been acquiring the dwarven earth maps from Nova Luna, but damaging the cohesion of his enemy's strongest team was an enticing prospect. Wracking his brain, Sylith tried to think of ways he could increase the Titan squad's dissatisfaction with their leader.\"Two.\"\"Is this really necessary?\" Sylith took a small step back, holding up his hands. \"You know, I really did not have the desire to kill you. I just want the maps. There is no need for you to die. We could talk about this peacefully. You can live. In fact, you don't even have to give me anything else. If you die, you'll drop gear and lose proficiencies. Why don't we talk about this?\"Thorn, unmoved by the murmurs and shifting feet behind him, slowly lifted his left hand and pointed, the burning light from the furnace glinting off of his silver claw.\"Three.\"*ting*The sound wasn't loud, but as Thorn pointed his finger, Sylith's face froze, and a terrible premonition filled him. The attacks of the Titan squad had not even touched the barrier when, to the Silver Guard's absolute horror, the [Invulnerable Silver Aegis] fractured into a million pieces.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

Thorn had held his attack and, as soon as the barrier fell, launched it at one of the nearby Silver Guard. Despite the utter shock he was feeling, the Silver Guard player managed to raise his shield, decades of in-game training saving his life.Thorn felt his tetsubo hit his enemy's shield, but the force of the blow was dispersed, shooting out from the shield toward the shields of the other Silver Guard standing nearby. Still, the weight of the strike drove his enemy to the ground. A puff of shadow appeared next to the downed Silver Guard, and a quick slice sent him to join his companion out of the game.Jorge turned his head, grinning at Sylith, who was apoplectic. The Shadow Assassin had struck at the worst possible time, taking down the barrier and allowing the Titan squad to eliminate two of the Silver Guard right off the bat. \"Hey, what's up?\" Jorge nodded at his former guild leader. Not bothering to wait for a response, the Dwarf vanished in a puff of shadow, leaving Sylith grinding his teeth. \"Charge!\" Thorn's voice echoed around the chamber, shocking the members of the Titan squad out of their stunned state. With a roar, they dashed forward, ignoring their fatigue as they attacked the Silver Guard. Very quickly, two more of the Silver Guard fell, leaving Sylith and twenty one Silver Guard facing off against Thorn and the forty nine players from Nova Luna. On the other side of the room, Raeth ordered the Silver Guard to drop the [Invulnerable Silver Aegis] and charge forward to join the fight. Seeing them coming, Mina shouted a warning, and a number of the DPS players rotated around to engage. The fighting was fast and furious, with spells and arrows flying everywhere. Thorn pushed forward, his weapon smashing Silver Guard aside as he headed directly for Sylith. The Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight was the source of all of this, and Thorn was determined to put an end to it. Tossing another Silver Guard away, Thorn activated [Wolf's Rage], increasing his speed immediately by an order of magnitude.Undeterred by the sight of their companions being knocked around like bowling pins, two more Silver Guard stepped in Thorn's path, their shields raised. Not bothering to swing his weapon, Thorn simply lowered his shoulder and drove himself forward. Both Silver Guard were sent reeling, but their firm stances had succeeded in reducing Thorn's speed, allowing another two Silver Guard to get in his way. His eyes narrowing, Thorn put away his tetsubo and dove forward, stretching his massive body out flat as he passed neatly over the heads of the two players in his way. Landing with his hands on the ground, he tucked his feet under his body and surged back to his feet, slapping another Silver Guard away as he came face to face with Sylith. Without a word, Thorn drew his tetsubo and attacked with a full power strike.Sylith had drawn his glittering lance while Thorn charged over and held it ready to parry the blow he knew was coming. He had contemplated attacking as Thorn arrived, but he simply could not risk Thorn deciding to trade blows. Now, faced with Thorn's attack, he skillfully stabbed forward with his lance, deflecting the incoming tetsubo into the ground.*BOOM* The stone floor next to Sylith exploded into shards as Thorn's weapon landed. Seeing a glimmer through the dust and flying stone, Thorn jerked his head back, barely avoiding the razor sharp point of Sylith's lance. Lashing out with a front kick, Thorn felt it glance off of Sylith's armor, sending the knight sliding back. As the cloud of dust cleared, Thorn saw Sylith standing fifteen feet away, his shield and lance at the ready. Around them, the Silver Guard had gathered into small groups and were skillfully blunting the Titan squad's attacks. Straightening slightly, Sylith spit on the ground and gestured for Thorn to come forward with his chin. \"Come on, big boy. You wanted this, well you got it. Don't chicken out now.\"A quick glance around revealed the messy state of the fighting to Thorn, as well as the rest of the Silver Guard approaching quickly. \"Thorn, we need to leave! Now!\" Velin yelled at the Titan, sending a blast of white light from her staff toward one of the Silver Guard. \"We can't deal with all of them!\"\"Oh, don't tell me you are going to run away.\" Seeing the hesitation in Thorn's eyes, Sylith took a small step forward, his lance leveled at the Titan's throat. \"Though, a good dog always comes when their master calls, so I don't want to keep you, if you need to go.\"Up until now, Thorn had been keeping his enraged state under tight control despite the chaos of the battlefield around him. As Sylith's words filtered into his ears, Thorn felt that control slipping slightly, and his red eyes swung back to the Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight. Still he hesitated. He knew that Velin was right, there was no way for the newly formed Titan squad to take on the Silver Guard, but something in him was screaming that he could do it.With a supreme effort, Thorn quelled the burning in his chest and started to turn away, only to hear Sylith speak again.\"Hah, I guess I'll have to add cowardly mongrel to your list of nicknames, Thorn. How disappointing.\"Instantly, all reason fled from Thorn's mind and, with a roar or rage, Thorn launched himself at Sylith, his tetsubo smashing down toward the knight's head.\"Idiot.\" Sylith smirked as he saw Thorn attack. Lifting his shield, Sylith activated one of his abilities, an ethereal shield that looked like a small version of the [Invulnerable Silver Aegis] appearing over him. *CRUNCH*The metal tetsubo smashed into the the energy shield, sending cracks radiating through it. With a grunt, Thorn forced his weapon through, landing a solid hit on Sylith's shield. The knight staggered slightly as he backpedaled, trying to disperse the force. Winding up for another strike, Thorn saw his enemy's lance was stabbing toward his leg but he ignored it, focusing on landing another hit. Sylith cursed under his breath and abandoned his attack, blocking another strike from the tetsubo. Realizing that there was no way for him to go toe to toe with Thorn, the Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight jumped backward, trying to gain some space.\"[Radiant Wings]!\" With a ringing screech, a set of metallic wings burst from the Dragon Knight's back, catching a draft in mid jump and sending him up into the air, out of Thorn's range. Hovering in the air, Sylith drew back his lance and grabbed it with both hands, lining the razor sharp tip up with the middle of Thorn's chest. A silver flash ran across the metallic feathers on his back, and he suddenly accelerated back toward the ground.\"[Diving Charge]!\"In his rage fueled state, Thorn saw Sylith flying up out of range of his tetsubo and snarled. Drawing back his arm, he hurled his metal weapon like a spear, sending it straight toward the hovering Dragon Knight just before he started his dive. Sylith dodged the incoming weapon with a neat twist, never slowing as he hurtled toward Thorn.The tetsubo passed by Sylith, ripping through the air and burying itself into the ceiling behind him. With a loud boom, a chunk of stone plummeted to the ground, sending shards of rock whizzing through the air. Not even considering dodging, Thorn brandished his claws and jumped to meet the Dragon Knight. The two met in mid air, lance clashing against fist. *TING*The lance's head glanced off of Thorn's gauntlet, and slashed a deep gouge through the armor on the top of his shoulder. The blow did nothing to stop Thorn, whose claws cut an equally large gash in the front of Sylith's shield. The force of the blow sent the Dragon Knight flying, his arm feeling like it had nearly been ripped off.Both combatants landed on the ground and rushed toward each other, the players in their way scattering to avoid getting caught in the middle. Thorn sprinted forward, ignoring the blood splashing from the cut on his shoulder. Sylith activated one of his abilities, a golden glow covering his arm and healing the damage that Thorn's attack had caused.\"Come on, big boy. I can do this all day.\" Normally calm and collected, the fight had woken something wild in Sylith. A fanatical desire to battle shown through his eyes, and he ran toward Thorn eagerly.Behind them, the rest of the battle raged on. Raeth and the other twenty-four Silver Guard had crossed the room and joined up with the rest of their group, trapping the players from Nova Luna. Dividing into groups of three, the Silver Guard began to push into the Titan squad's formation, using their incredible defense to force it apart. A human tank was the first to fall prey to the Silver Guard's tactic as she was surrounded. Focused on fighting a group of three Silver Guard in front of her, she was caught by surprise when two other groups surged past her, completely ignoring the waves of attacks coming their way. Suddenly, all three groups turned to face her and, pointing toward her, called out at the same time.\"[Holy Strike]!\"A beam of scalding light fell from the ceiling, scorching her armor and turning her into a flicker of lights as she died. The three teams each stepped back, forming a solid wall of silver metal as they weathered the Titan squad's attacks. All over the battlefield this was repeated, and within a couple minutes, Nova Luna had lost five of their frontline players.\"Thorn!\" Starting to become desperate, Velin called out again, but the Titan was too busy exchanging blows with Sylith to respond. Seven Twisted Leaves was doing his best to organize the remaining players from the Titan squad into a defensive formation, but the Silver Guard had them surrounded and continued to pick them apart.On the edge of the fight, Mina's ice orbs were in full swing, sending steady streams of ice spikes at the enemies nearby. By focusing her aim at the Silver Guard's heads, she bought enough time to cast one of her large, area of effect spells, but just as she was about to complete it, a sword darted toward her back, forcing her to blink away. Spinning to face Raeth, she leveled her wand at his chest.\"Hello, Mina.\" Raeth held his sword out, watching the Ice Witch carefully.\"Get out of my way, Raeth. You know you can't beat me in a fight.\"\"That certainly used to be the case, but what about three of us? Besides, I don't have to beat you.\" Raeth shook his head, his expression serious. \"So long as I tie you up, the rest will be able to do what they need to.\"As much as she hated to admit it, Mina knew the captain of the Silver Guard was right. Even if Raeth only delayed her, the rest of the Titan squad would get picked off one by one. With a grimace, she slid forward, determined to end the fight as quickly as possible.Three Silver Guard had just finished casting [Holy Strike] when one of them noticed Baxby carefully rolling up the large map while the two Dwarven earth maps that Nova Luna had collected rolled around at his feet. Nudging his companions, he pointed with his head toward the treasure hunter, and all three Silver Guard began to close in on him.Baxby quickly noticed the group of Silver Guard heading his way and ducked down to pick up the Dwarven earth maps. Grabbing the first, he reached for the second in a hurry and missed it, causing it to roll away from his hand. Quickly chasing after it, he stumbled forward, causing the triple stacked [Holy Strike] the Silver Guard had just cast to miss. Finally managing to snag the runaway sphere, Baxby broke into a run, only to come to a stop almost immediately as he came up against more Silver Guard.On the other side of the general melee, Thorn was struggling against Sylith. When the Titan had fought Ouroboros, he had been able to keep pace by virtue of his immense strength, but Sylith was too skilled for that. The Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight had almost completely mastered his class and was extremely adept at diverting Thorn's strength, keeping him from ever truly bringing it to bear.Frustrated by his inability to land a solid hit, Thorn began to push himself to move faster, spurred on by the increasing casualty rate among his guildmates. Still, no matter how quickly he struck, Sylith's lance seemed to get there before him, pushing his strikes off target. Sylith managed each attack perfectly, deflecting what he could and blocking what he couldn't. He even had time to strike back, and soon Thorn was looking like a miserable wreck. Having already used two of his instances of [Wolf's Rage] in this fight, Thorn was loath to use his last charge, but as he took the opportunity to glance behind him, he realized that he did not have a choice. The Silver Guard had taken a few more casualties, thanks in large part to Mina, but they looked numerous compared to the few players from the Titan squad that remained. At some point, the balance of the fight had shifted, and the Silver Guard were able to completely surround the Titan squad, taking them down one by one. When Thorn finally looked around, there were only five players left, stubbornly holding on in the middle. Velin stood in the center of the group, casting healing spells as fast as she could, Mina next to her. At some point Seven Twisted Leaves had fallen, as had Delmore. Next to the girls, three other support players were doing their best to keep themselves alive, to no avail. As Thorn watched, two of them were hit with [Holy Strike], the secondary burning effect forcing the others to move away as they evaporated into the aether.Ashen faced, Thorn stared at them. The others had warned him how disastrous it would be to try and go up against the Silver Guard directly, but he had not listened, confident in his ability to carry the day. Yet, the plain hard truth lay before him, stabbing into his heart like a dagger. In front of him, Sylith cast yet another healing spell as he lifted his lance and shield, ready for another round.\"I told you it wouldn't turn out well for you.\" Sylith grinned, the cut on his face left by one of Thorn's claws healing at a visible rate. \"Such a shame you did not listen, but that is how it goes. You know, they say that the bigger you are, the harder you will fall. Now get ready to die.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

Gear was scattered across the scarred stone floor, reminding Thorn of each player that had fallen to the Silver Guard's [Holy Strike] ability. Staring at the three remaining players, Thorn felt his chest tighten. He wasn't sure if it was the disappointment or the burning air of the chamber that filled his lungs, that made it hard to breath. \"Thorn!\" Velin's shout snapped him out of his thoughts.It was obvious that they were not going to get out of this situation alive, so Thorn abandoned all pretense. Flexing his claws, he dashed toward his teammates, activating his last instance of [Wolf's Rage]. Behind him, Sylith saw that he was abandoning the fight and gave chase to try and slow him down.Two Silver Guard stepped in front of him, but Thorn spun to the side as he dodged passed them. One of the silver armored players tried to bash Thorn in the ribs with his shield, only to feel Thorn's spinning hand land on his back. With a screech, Thorn's claws sank into the the Silver Guard's armor, and he lifted him bodily from the ground. Swinging his metal-clad enemy like a flail, Thorn battered away another two Silver Guard who were in his way, clearing a path toward his teammates. It only took a couple of seconds for Thorn to close the remaining distance, and as soon as he arrived, he held the captured Silver Guard player over Velin's head, absorbing a fully stacked [Holy Strike] that fell from the ceiling. With a crackle, the unfortunate Silver Guard player evaporated under the intense light of his ally's [Holy Strike].Ignoring the swearing that erupted from the rest of the players from Ragnarok, Thorn took advantage of their shocked pause to strike out, laying out another Silver Guard with repeated blows. Thorn could accept that he could not beat Sylith in a fight; after all, the Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight was one of the best players in the game. What really helped him understand that he had screwed up was that each Silver Guard took him multiple hits to take down.Used to ripping through anything and anyone he came up against, the sheer toughness of the dual category Silver Guard class left Thorn shocked. Still, his attacks were effective, and in the chaotic melee that followed, Thorn managed to take down another three before Sylith arrived. The Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight summoned his metal wings with his [Radiant Wings] ability and rapidly closed the distance, his lance aimed directly at Thorn's heart.Just before the lance reached its target, Mina waved her wand and called out.\"[Ice Wall]. [Ice Wall]. [Ice Wall].\"Rising abruptly from the ground, three large sheets of iron-hard ice pushed the Silver Guard aside, creating a solid wall between Sylith and Thorn. Without pausing, Mina began casting another spell as Sylith impacted the first wall. His lance thrust out, smashing the wall to pieces as if it were made of glass. Bashing through the first wall, Syltih hit the second, which shattered exactly like the first. The third [Ice Wall] lasted half a second longer before it too, was broken into shards of ice that spread through the air, pinging off Sylith's golden armor.\"[Blizzard]!\"As the tip of his spear peeked out of the cloud of ice, Mina's spell landed and all of the shards of ice began to spin rapidly, leeching the last bit of speed from Sylith's charge. Seizing the opportunity, Thorn took two large steps forward and spun, his massive leg shooting out behind him at Sylith. Landing squarely on the Dragon Knight's shield, the force of the kick sent Sylith flying backward like a rocket. \"Velin, we have to get out of here!\" Mina shouted, dodging a sword thrust with a backward slide. By now, the four players from Nova Luna were completely surrounded by Silver Guard and were being slowly squeezed together. Thorn was doing his best to keep Velin free of attacks, but there was no way he could stop so many enemy players. Looking around, he could not see Jorge or Baxby and could only hope that they had gotten away safely. \"Just give up, Thorn. This is a pointless fight.\" Staggering up, his golden armor completely covered in dust, Sylith shook his head to try and clear it. Thorn's kick had taken the air out of his lungs, so it took him a couple minutes to struggle to his feet. \"Just give me those maps.\"\"Maps? What maps?\" Despite the ragged state of his armor, Thorn's breathing was even. The heat of the dungeon was not nearly as bad in Exploration mode, so he was not having any problems with stamina yet.\"Don't play around with me.\" Sylith's eyes narrowed as he stared at the Titan. \"Do you mean the maps that I sent away before the fight?\" Thorn's tone was innocent, even as he blocked a slash from a sword and backhanded a player across the room. Pouncing forward, he picked up another player in both hands, lifting him into the air.\"Get him!\" Raeth, who was nearby, shouted out a command and charged toward Thorn, his sword held out. Two other Silver Guard attacked with him, their blades cutting toward Thorn's waist.The Titan ignored the incoming attacks, his face barely twitching as the three swords cut into him. Instead, heaving the Silver Guard player through the air, Thorn threw him into the furnace, where he disappeared with a terrified scream.\"Yo... You can do that?\" Mina asked, incredulously as all of the Silver Guard players around Thorn scattered out of arm's reach. Thorn, rather pleased with the effect, looked at Raeth, who was watching him nervously. Before Thorn could move, he heard a victorious shout from across the room, where three Silver Guard players had finally cornered Baxby. The old treasure hunter had been running away from them for almost ten minutes but had finally been trapped by a fallen statue. His pursuers watched him like hawks, secretly terrified that he would slip away again. No matter how they had attacked, Baxby had either dodged or gotten lucky, causing the attacks to miss over and over again.\"Hey, can't we talk about this?\" Baxby held up his hands as he looked around. The three players cornering him said nothing, just waiting for [Holy Strike] to come off cool down. \"Sylith, let him go.\" Thorn's voice rumbled through the room, surprising everyone. \"No, no one leaves.\" The Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight's voice was grim. \"He isn't part of our guild. Are you sure you want to antagonize the Drifters, as well?\"\"Shut up.\" Sylith was fuming, his eyes burning brightly as he stared at the shattered remains of his team. Despite reducing the Titan squad to only four players, Sylith was not pleased at all. There were only seventeen Silver Guard left after the grueling fight, the rest having fallen to Nova Luna's blades.\"I think we're passed that point, Thorn.\" Velin's voice came from behind Thorn, and he winced at how cold it was. Making no effort to hide her anger, Velin looked away from the Titan and started chanting under her breath.Wracking his brain for a way out, Thorn was about to grab the girls and try to make a run for it when Sylith's gaze swung to him. \"Let's finish this.\" Without waiting for a response, Sylith charged forward, his wings rippling behind him. The silver head of his weapon glinted evilly in the light of the roaring furnace as it stabbed toward Thorn's chest. Cursing under his breath, Thorn settled into a defensive stance as he prepared to meet the charge. In his rage-fueled state, he had thrown his tetsubo earlier, and now it was buried in the ceiling on the other side of the room.The incoming lance darted forward, sliding through Thorn's defenses and stabbing into his side where one of the Silver Guard had left a cut. Thorn grimaced at the pain and tried to wrap his massive hand around the lance, only to have it slip from his grasp. Not giving him any time to rest, Sylith spun on his heel and slammed his shield into Thorn's shoulder. Normally a blow like this would have staggered the target, but instead, it was Sylith who was sent backward. Bouncing off of Thorn from the force of the hit, Sylith used the distance that was created from the rebound to stab his lance forward again, landing another hit on Thorn's side. Gritting his teeth in rage, Thorn aimed a kick at Sylith, who was still in the air, only for the Dragon Knight to vault over it after deflecting the force with his shield.\"Attack!\" Seeing that Sylith had Thorn well in hand, Raeth commanded the last of the Silver Guard to deal with Velin, Mina, and the remaining Nova Luna player. Across the room, the three players who had Baxby cornered were getting ready to use [Holy Strike].\"Hah, reminds me of old times.\" Mina sighed as she aimed her wand at the incoming enemy. \"I'm about out of juice, so I'll see you on the other side.\"\"Me too. I probably have enough for one more spell. Buy me some time.\"\"You got it.\" Muttering a spell, Mina slid directly toward the Silver Guard, ducking under the sword of the first enemy and blinking past him into the thick of the charging players. Completely surrounded, she gathered all three of her ice orbs and commanded them to shatter, sending waves of freezing air pulsing over the Silver Guard.\"[Avalanche]!\" Above the group, snow and ice began to materialize, rushing down to bury them. Caught in the middle, Mina was swallowed by the snow, hidden from everyone's vision. \"[Sub Zero]!\" Her muffled voice sounding from underneath the piles of snow, Raeth felt the cold around him increase drastically. His armor frosted over and he suppressed the intense desire to start shivering uncontrollably. For half a second, he stopped moving completely, before shaking off the stunned effect. Yet that half second was enough, and as he began to move, his vision was filled with a blinding light as a laser beam shot into his chest, burning a neat hole right through it.The beam of light only lasted for a moment and completely sapped the rest of Velin's energy, but as she leaned heavily on her staff, a small smile flashed across her lips before disappearing like it had never been there. In the center of the mass of iced-over Silver guard, Mina had just popped her head out when a beam of light fell from the ceiling. Gazing up at the approaching [Holy Strike], Mina sighed. They had done their best, but it had not been good enough. Before she had time to look back at Velin, the [Holy Strike] landed, sending her out of the game. Across the room, Velin leaned on her staff, not even bothering to move when another [Holy Strike] consumed her figure.Seeing them go, Baxby grimaced. Dying was always a pain, but it was occasionally unavoidable, so he wouldn't shrink from it. The three Silver Guard who had cornered him were watching him intently for any sign that he was going to try to escape, and when he lifted his hands, they took a small step back. \"If we can't talk about this, then you can't blame me, okay? You have to understand that this is all part of a game, right? So don't come after me or anything.\"Confused, the Silver Guard glanced at each other. The player in the center shrugged and lifted his sword, getting ready to cast [Holy Strike]. As the other two players began to raise their swords, Baxby suddenly grinned. If he was going to go down, then he was going to make them regret it. \"Hey, Sylith!\" Summoning the two dwarven earth maps from his inventory, the old treasure hunter waved them at the Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight, who was busy fighting against Thorn. Taking a big step forward, Baxby launched them into the air, laughing maniacally as the two orbs arched over the combatants. A second later, he disappeared under the bright light of a stacked [Holy Strike].\"[Radiant Wings]!\"Seeing the Dwarven earth maps flying through the air, Sylith summoned his wings and shot up into the air to intercept them. As he rose from the ground, Thorn reached up and latched onto one of his legs, instantly stopping his ascent. Thorn's massive hand wrapped all the way around his armored leg, and Sylith's direction suddenly changed as the Titan threw him against the ground.*BANG*Hitting the ground so hard that the stone floor cracked, Sylith instantly rolled away, avoiding the giant foot that stomped down where his head had been a moment before. Cursing under his breath, Thorn watched as Sylith shot away across the floor, his wings carrying him out of Thorn's range. Both players looked up for the Dwarven earth maps just in time to see them disappearing into the raging inferno of the furnace that dominated the side of the room.Completely drowning out Thorn's sigh of relief, Sylith gave a roar of rage and stabbed toward Thorn. Thorn slapped the lance to the side and punched forward, only to find himself once again facing the point of the lance. Gritting his teeth, Thorn abandoned his attack and blocked again, but the attacks started coming so fast and furious that he could not manage to avoid all of them. Sylith was an expert in controlling the flow of battle and his fury at losing the Dwarven earth maps put his combat ability on full display. Despite his size and strength advantages, Thorn simply could not land a solid blow on the Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight. At the same time, the incessant lance strikes were beginning to chop through Thorn's armor, leaving gashes all over his body. Thorn could feel himself slowing down as his health drained. The few remaining Silver Guard slowly dragged themselves over to surround Thorn, all the while making sure to keep a healthy distance from him. No matter how wounded he was, the sight of Thorn lobbing one of their teammates into the furnace was fresh in their minds.The fight dragged on for a few more minutes, but Thorn had no chance of turning it around and finally fell, the victim of a vicious thrust to his throat. Slumping down on the stone floor, Thorn felt his eyelids turning heavy and managed to turn his head enough to take in the completely ruined room. Broken armor and dropped loot covered the shattered floor, a testament to the absolute devastation of the fight. From the corner of his eye, he saw the handle of his tetsubo, still stuck in the ceiling. Closing his eyes, a part of Thorn was glad for the darkness and the reprieve it would bring from the sea of frustration and anger that filled his chest.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

Soft reds and blues lightly touched Thorn's face as he stood staring out the floor-to-ceiling windows in the massive building he shared with his aunt. The members of the Titan squad stood behind him, their eyes fixed on his broad back.After coming to Fantasia, Thorn had called for a debrief, gathering the Titan squad in one of the larger meeting rooms in the middle of the building. Despite the beauty of the scene, the atmosphere was gloomy, each of the players occupied with their own thoughts. After a moment of silence, Thorn took a deep breath and began to speak quietly.\"I'm sorry.\" Thorn turned to face the rest of the room, his eyes slowly scanning each of the people present. \"I take full responsibility for this. I did not listen to the good advice that was presented, and I led us into a full team wipe. I was overconfident. Overconfident in my own abilities, as both a leader and as a fighter. Overconfident in our team's ability to take on the enemy, even after I was told otherwise.\"I was selfish, thinking that my way was the best way. Honestly, I had no idea that other players could be so incredibly strong. Don't take this as an excuse. I was told plainly by multiple people that the Silver Guard were an enemy that we could not beat, and I still chose to ignore that advice and do my own thing. I made a bad decision, and as a result, you have all lost proficiency and gear. I can't compensate you directly for the proficiency loss, but you will all be compensated for your gear loss.\"I will deal with the legal ramifications of breaking our agreement with Ragnarok, so you don't have to worry about that. Just be aware that we are now at odds with them. While neither guild has officially declared war, you can treat our states as such. I would anticipate conflict if you run into members of the Silver Guard. This also puts us behind on the World Quest. Ragnarok will have a leg up, so we need to be ready to move as fast as possible when we can log back in. In fact, if not for Baxby's quick thinking, we would be further behind than we are, so a major thank you to him.\"Seeing the questioning looks from the rest of the room, the old treasure hunter shrugged.\"It was more spite than anything else. I don't like people who attack me, so Ragnarok has made it to the top of my list.\"\"Hah, well still. You throwing the dwarven earth maps into the furnace was brilliant.\" Pausing for a moment as chuckles swept the room, Thorn held up his hand for quiet. \"But, to be safe, we have to assume that Sylith will have a way of getting them out. If they do get their hands on the maps, they will quickly find out about the keys and will be within striking distance of the end of the quest. According to Velin's analysis, the last piece of the quest is the boss fight, so let's make sure we are ready for that in twenty-three hours when we can get back into the game.\"As the players filed out, Thorn gestured for Mina, Velin, Jorge, and Baxby to stay back. \"I owe you a more personal apology.\" Thorn hung his head as he faced the small group. \"I let my pride get in the way, and the result was terrible. I know it's not inspiring when the person you are trusting to lead you ignores your good advice and makes atrocious decisions. I would like to ask you to forgive me.\"\"Of course, Thorn.\" Mina patted her large friend on the arm. \"Honestly, I'm more disappointed that we are behind the curve with the quest then I am that we died. Dying is par for the course in this game, especially when your opponent is one of the top guilds.\"\"Mina is right.\" Velin chimed in, her face serious. \"It was a terrible decision, but as Baxby said, you are our leader, and we need to trust the decisions you make. I do hope you will take our words more seriously next time.\" \"I absolutely will. As I mentioned earlier, it boggles my mind that a team could be so strong, but I need to remember that there is a lot I don't know about this game.\"\"What I really want to know is how Ragnarok snuck up on us.\" Velin's cold gaze landed on Jorge, who was sitting in a chair along the wall. Holding up his hands to indicate his innocence, the Dwarf nodded his chin toward Thorn, causing Velin to turn back to the Titan.\"Yeah, that was my fault, as well.\" Thorn stared out the window again, his voice glum. \"Jorge reported that we were being followed pretty early on, but I told him to keep it to himself. I figured that Sylith was going to try something funny, but I thought we could take the Silver Guard in a straight fight. I certainly did not anticipate that they would trap us like that, but that is what Jorge was for. As it turned out, they honestly could have just attacked us, and they probably would have killed us faster.\"\"You knew about them? Why on earth would you keep that to yourself?! If we had known, we could have come up with some sort of plan.\"\"You are completely right. Looking back on my decision, I really don't have any way of justifying myself, so I'm not even going to bother trying. Like I said, it was hubris on my part.\" Seeing Mina's confused look, Thorn explained, \"Pride that led to my downfall. I tried to pull one over on Sylith and ended up getting creamed. I thought that between my ability and having Jorge in ambush, we could have beaten the Silver Guard. I guess I was wrong.\"The room fell into silence as everyone processed what had happened. The guild had been riding high after their trade with Eastern Alliance for the second Dwarven earth map and morale had been great. All of that was brought crashing to the ground only a few hours later as they lost the lead to Ragnarok.\"Speaking of your downfall, what happened after we died?\" Mina asked, unable to bear the silence that filled the room.\"Sylith kicked my butt,\" Thorn said frankly, rubbing the back of his head. \"First of all, I'm an idiot, and I threw my weapon away at the beginning of the fight. But even if I had kept it, I'm sure he still would have ripped me apart. His use of the lance was absolutely masterful, in fact I don't think I've ever seen anyone use a weapon quite so well. Plus, I could hardly touch him, and when I did, he just shrugged it off with a self heal.\"\"You know, there is a reason that quad category class holders are considered the best in the game,\" Jorge said, half laughing. \"Yeah, I see that now. I thought Sylith would be more like Ouroboros. He had a quad category class, but he was not nearly as hard to fight.\"\"Probably because he was not as accustomed to his class. He had only been playing it for a few months.\"\"Good point. Sylith's use of his weapons and abilities was absolutely flawless. In fact, I don't think he made a mistake the entire time. Well, maybe at the end when Baxby threw the orbs into the furnace. At that point, I got him on the ground, but he escaped before I could capitalize on it. After that, he was really mad and cut me to pieces.\"\"Ugh. Well, at least Baxby made sure he did not get the Dwarven earth maps.\" Mina took Velin's hand in her own, trying to cheer up the frowning Elf.\"Well...about that.\" For the first time in the conversation, Baxby spoke up. \"Honestly, he probably already has them. Ragnarok is a pretty resourceful guild, so I wouldn't be surprised if he figured out how to get them out of the furnace.\"\"You don't think they were destroyed?\" Thorn asked, his brow furrowing.\"No, I don't. The earth maps are quest items, so destroying them before the quest is over is highly unlikely. And while the furnace is superheated, there are a number of ways that I can think of to retrieve the dwarven earth map. At this point, we have to assume that they either have the maps or are close to getting them.\"\"Well, that is disappointing. I guess my decisions were worse than I thought.\"\"Eh, that's what happens when you don't listen to good advice.\" Baxby shrugged, sparing no thought for Thorn's feelings. \"You end up making terrible choices from sheer ignorance. Just as a note going forward, don't do that again.\"\"Yeah.\" Thorn lowered his head sheepishly. \"I'll try not to.\"\"Alright, enough of that.\" Velin patted Mina's shoulder and stood up, her deep frown easing as the calm and cold expression came back to her face. \"We need to figure out what we are doing from here. Our position is not good, but it isn't impossible to think that we could complete the World Quest.\"\"We got the map, right? So we know the path through the labyrinth?\" Mina followed Velin to the large table.\"Yes. Baxby?\"\"Yup. Here you go. One map of the labyrinth and the path to complete it.\" The old treasure hunter pulled the large map of Rakkam's fire section out of his inventory and unrolled it onto the table. \"And we also have the keys for the dungeon, right?\" Thorn looked at Baxby, a sinking feeling growing in his chest. The keys were quest items like the two dwarven earth maps, which meant that they would have automatically dropped when Baxby died.\"What do you take me for? A noob?\" Baxby snorted disdainfully when he saw Thorn's panicked expression. \"I stored them in my bank. The 22nd rule of the treasure hunter's guide. Repeat after me: Never take quest items out of the bank until you need to use them. There are too many traps and other unexpected dangers when you go dungeon diving to carry important quest items on your person.\"\"Whew.\" Thorn breathed out in relief. \"That scared me for a moment.\"\"I'll grab them before we enter the dungeon again.\"Running her finger lightly over the map, Velin let it hover over the three marked spots for a moment before continuing to follow the path that led to the dungeon's exit. Her brow furrowed slightly as she compared it with the map she had.\"This map is different. What is going on here?\"\"Well, it looks like the labyrinth changes.\" Baxby scratched his chin and then pointed to one of the marked spots. \"What you see in this first section is the same as the labyrinth that we've already experienced. This first marked location is where the first key goes. Once we fit it in, the labyrinth will change, which will open up this path to the second keyhole. That keyhole changes the path again, and then the third keyhole will open up the exit.\"\"Alright.\" Velin rubbed her head. \"We have twenty-two hours until we can enter the dungeon. Thorn, you'll be leading the Titan squad. Baxby, are you planning to join the team?\"\"No, I'm not going to be any help at this point.\"\"In that case, it will be the regular team, does that sound good?\"\"Yes, that is fine.\" Thorn nodded. \"I might try to find another weapon between now and then because mine is still in the dungeon.\"\"I can help with that.\" Mina raised her hand. Taking Velin's hand, she looked at her with concern. \"Velin, you should go take a rest. You look pretty exhausted.\" \"I might need to.\" Rubbing her face with her hands, Velin frowned. \"Thorn, I'm sorry, but I do think I need to sleep. It has been a while since I last logged out, and I'm starting to drag.\"\"Sure, take the time you need. Is everything alright?\"\"Yes, everything is fine. I'm just exhausted, and I think it is starting to negatively affect my mood and decision making. I'll be better after I rest.\" Patting Mina on the shoulder, Velin said goodbye to Baxby and Jorge and waved to Thorn as she began to walk out.Thorn watched her go with concerned eyes. Ever since she had opened up to him about her frustrations, she seemed a little off and his most recent failure had only made it worse. Just as he was about to go after her, he felt a hand on his stomach as Mina blocked his path. The Ice Witch shook her head at him, waiting until Velin had left the room to speak.\"Give her space, please. She really has been working too hard over the last week. I think she is going to need some time to get over this setback. Really, I think all of us need rest.\"\"Man, I really messed up, didn't I?\" Thorn let out a heavy sigh. \"Yeah, you did. A lot of people have put a lot of effort into this quest, Thorn. And it is disappointing to see it thrown away like this. But everyone makes mistakes, so don't beat yourself up too hard.\" Patting Thorn's side, Mina grinned up at him. \"Definitely don't do it again, though. Alright, let's see about getting you a new weapon. I'm thinking a massive sword. Like really big.\"\"I do better with maces.\"\"Really? Because from what I've seen, you tend to resort to using your claws and feet a lot.\" Jorge, who had been silent for the whole conversation jumped in now that the topic had switched.\"Yeah, I hit so hard that I just dull swords anyway.\" \"What about a spear? Your reach is crazy, and you could carry a massive spear.\"\"Have you tried using a bow? That could be cool. Not like your siege crossbow, but like a regular bow? Though finding something big enough for you might be a problem.\"\"Thorn should really use a set of armored gauntlets.\" Baxby cut in. \"With his strength, it is a shame to waste him on ranged attacks.\"\"Or maybe he should just throw boulders at people. Like a walking siege engine.\" Mina laughed.Listening to the others cheerfully discussing what sort of weapon would make him the most lethal as they left the room, some of the burden on his heart lightened. Taking one last look at the beautiful sky outside, Thorn strode after them, determined to do better.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

The thin Elf seemed to have the ability to make himself comfortable anywhere.\"There had to be bad news, huh? Alright. Hit me with it.\" Thorn sighed and lowered the long metal staff that he was testing out.\"Alright, the good news is that we have more information about the final boss fight. The bad news is that Sylith and the Silver Guard are already there. They cleared the labyrinth roughly two hours ago. That is why I came over to Fantasia to talk to you instead of just sending a message.\"Groaning, Thorn looked at the countdown timer that still showed two hours before he could log back into Nova Terra. The Titan squad had gathered and was waiting to log in, so hearing that the Silver Guard had already moved to the next stage was disheartening. \"Well, that is terrible.\"\"Not entirely.\" Corvo shook his head briefly. \"It looks like the final stage of the quest is the boss fight. But this boss is a monster. Probably the toughest enemy to appear in the game to date. According to our sources, he is the ancient king of the Dwarves, some sort of grandmaster mage. Crazy strong, lots of magic. The Silver Guard got wiped in less than an hour and are regrouping to go back in. \"The fight went so badly that Ragnarok released information about how to beat the labyrinth and details on the last fight so that other guilds can join them. My guess, based on what we've heard, is that the boss will be unbeatable until all of the sections are passed. But now that people know how to clear the labyrinth, the race is on.\"\"Alright. So we have some time. Good.\" Putting the metal staff down, Thorn picked up a sword and gave it a few experimental swings. With a blade that was two feet wide and a total length of seven feet, it looked more like a shield than a sword. \"Yup. We do. The battle appears to require multiple teams, so I wouldn't stress about that too much, but it won't hurt to hurry.\" As Thorn dropped the sword to pick up an oversized warhammer, Corvo glanced around casually. \"Where is Velin? I have a couple things to ask her.\"\"She is still sleeping. She was pretty wiped out, so we are letting her rest.\" The warhammer landed on the pile of oversized weapons with a tremendous clatter as Thorn tossed it aside. Even with the events of the last twenty-four hours, it wasn't like Velin to miss something this important. Thorn couldn't find it in himself to judge her for it though, as she had been so overtaxed in the last battle. Still, he was sure he'd keenly feel her absence in the coming fight. Flexing his fingers, the Titan turned to Mina with a shrug. \"I don't really like any of them. I liked the tetsubo because it was a mace, so it smashed things well, but it could be used for ripping with the spikes. These all feel too flimsy. Like they will break when I hit something with them.\"\"Well, you need something. You can't just walk around bare handed. I mean,\" Mina's brow furrowed as she thought, \"I guess you could just walk around bare handed. You have your claws.\"\"This is what I keep trying to tell you! You should just fight with your hands. Armored gauntlets are the way to go.\" Baxby was so excited that he was nearly hopping up and down. \"You can just run up to people and punch them in the face! And then, if they try to block, just grab their weapon and hit them with it!\"Recoiling backward to avoid the spittle that Baxby's exuberance sent flying through the air, Mina grimaced. \"But how does he deal with things that are out of his reach? We talked about this. If he is going up against Sylith's lance, he is going to be in trouble because his arms are not long enough.\"\"They look pretty long to me.\" Jorge chuckled from the side where he was dragging over a huge flail. Dropping it with a bang, he sat down on the handle and patted it triumphantly. \"Now this is the weapon he needs. Dangerous, unpredictable, gives him the extra range he needs. Look at those spikes on the end. Anything you hit with this will be obliterated. Hahaha.\"For a second, Thorn imagined himself with the flail, smashing his way through hordes of enemies. And then his blood ran cold as he imagined the massive spikes on the metal ball stabbing into him when he messed up a swing and accidently hit himself. Shivering slightly, Thorn shook his head.\"Look, Thorn, the real problem is that your fighting style is all over the place.\" Mina tapped her wand as she talked, her eyes misted in thought. It was strange to see Mina in lecturing mode, but Thorn had to admit that she knew what she was talking about. Giving the Ice Witch his full attention, he waited for her to continue.\"There are two approches to PvP. Either you play to your strengths, or you play around your opponent's weaknesses. A perfect fighter does both. However, even a perfect fighter's style will change depending on the strength of their enemy. Take me for example. My class is one of the better double category classes for PvP. I have great single target damage and a large pool of crowd control abilities, which makes me effective in both one on one and team fights.\"However, my strategy changes pretty drastically if I am facing a single opponent versus when I face multiple targets. With multiple targets, I focus on creating chaos, so I can take advantage of their mistakes, whittling the group down as they mess up. Against a single opponent, I just overwhelm them and burn through their defense as fast as possible. Against multiple people, I play to their weaknesses, like capitalizing on their lack of coordination and magnifying that weakness as much as possible. But with one target, I play to my strengths. I use stuns and high damage to keep the fights short.\"Laser focus is one of the biggest advantages a fighter can develop. If you can focus all of your actions around a singular objective, or even a few objectives, you become more efficient. And more efficiency means a higher success rate. You have a wide range of strengths, so you should be identifying them and really focusing on them every time you fight.\"Regardless of who I am facing, I have a specific style that I play, and I stick to it. This means I might come up against someone I can't beat, but having a clear path to victory in 95% of my fights is better than having a hazy path in 100%. You are suffering from not having a cohesive style right now, so you stumble around in your fights, doing whatever comes to mind. Instead, you need to pick a plan and stick to it.\"\"Yeah, that makes sense.\" Thorn rubbed the back of his head as he thought. He often found himself focusing on hitting his target as hard as he possibly could, but as his fight with Sylith demonstrated, a skilled player could completely shut that down. \"So, what do you suggest?\"\"Let's take a look at your advantages.\" Mina pushed her wide brimmed witch's hat back on her head and pulled out a piece of paper and a pen. Licking the end of the pen, she began to make notes. \"You have near infinite stamina. You are impossibly strong. You have reach. You are naturally tough. You have decent martial arts training. You have a rage ability. You have two area heals. Honestly, on paper, you should win every fight.\"Your problem is applying your strength. There are abilities that prevent you from being able to use your full strength by either blocking the damage or preventing you from hitting. So, to come up with a plan, we'll want to try and cover for those two things by applying your strength in a particular way. I think focusing on your strengths in both one on one situations and in group fights makes a lot of sense. You don't need to hunt for weaknesses.\"You know, the more I think about this, the more I think that Baxby's method makes more sense. You are the ultimate one-hit KO machine. So long as you can get your hands on them, they are going to have next to no chance to recover.\" Mina looked and pointed her pen at Thorn's hands. \"From what it sounds like, if you had kept hold of Sylith when you grabbed his leg, you probably could have killed him. I think your plan of attack should be to grab people and not let go until they're dead.\"\"Bit gruesome to rip people in half, isn't it?\" \"I mean, you don't actually have to do that. You can stab them with your claws, or carry a short blade and chop at them. Besides, it's not like you'll see blood. Players don't bleed when they die, so if you kill them fast enough, it will be really clean.\"\"Okay, I can get behind this. So the plan will just be to close the distance as quickly as possible and focus on downing a single target at a time?\"\"Effectively. I'd carry some weapons just in case you need more reach. But if I were you, I'd use a short blade and try to get into close combat as much as possible.\"\"Something like this?\" Thorn rummaged through the pile, lifting out a two and a half foot long short sword with a heavy blade. It looked more like a dagger in his massive hands as he spun it. \"Perfect. And then maybe a club for targets that are immune to cutting or stabbing? I think getting another tetsubo is a good idea, but for now any club will do.\"Nodding, Thorn picked up the metal staff. As thick as Mina's wrist and a full seven feet long, it was made out of a solid piece of iron, but Thorn bent it casually in half and began wrapping some leather around one end, leaving him with a thick metal club.\"Such a waste,\" Baxby and Jorge both muttered at the exact same moment.Ignoring them, Thorn turned back to Corvo, who was watching all of the commotion with interest.\"What else do we know about the final boss fight?\"\"The boss is named Courdum the Stone King. Like I mentioned already, he is an ancient Dwarven king. He rules the labyrinth city of Rakkam and controls all of the stone Dwarves. The exact details are sketchy, but I think he made the Dwarves into the statues or something like that. He draws power from chained greater elementals, which makes him powerful enough to solo-wipe a full team of the Silver Guard. \"Each time a team clears one of the labyrinths, it frees one of the greater elementals, which reduces Courdum's power. At least, that is what we think. When the Silver Guard got there, the greater fire elemental was missing, so we are assuming that is how it works. Each team that gets through the labyrinth gets assigned to fight a boss, with the first being assigned to fight Courdum. As for the actual fight, there is not much we know except that Courdum is a monster, and his guards are almost as strong. \"The fight takes place on these split up platforms with each team needing to deal with their boss. Chances are the bosses are going to have some triggers, but we won't know until we get multiple teams in there to test it out. We do know that the longer the fight went, the harder that Courdum was to kill and the more damage he dealt, so it's likely that all the bosses are the same way. That is as much as we know. For actual specifics, we'll have to wait until we are there.\"\"Fair enough. Thank you, Corvo.\" Having settled on the weapon he was going to use, Thorn spent the rest of his time before the countdown ended storing various extra weapons in his inventory. If he had learned anything from the last fight it was that having an extra option for hitting other people was a good idea. Once he had a good variety of weapons, Thorn asked Mina to gather the Titan squad, and soon the fifty players were standing together, getting ready to login. Returning to where Thorn was sitting while he waited for the group, the Ice Witch nudged him.\"You might want to try to do something, Thorn. Everyone is still pretty down about our loss.\"\"What can I do?\" The Titan frowned as he looked over the group. The players from Nova Luna were standing together, talking quietly, a sense of heaviness in the air.\"I don't know. Say something. Or do a dance. The point is that you are the leader, so you need to get them fired up. Look, just because you messed up, doesn't mean you can shirk your responsibilities. It means you need to do better and work harder, and that includes getting everyone excited for what we're about to do.\"\"Alright, alright, I get it.\" Thorn held up his hands in defeat. Mina was completely right, of course. There was no reason for him to shrink back from his duties as a leader. In fact, he knew that he should really be doing exactly the opposite. Now was the time to do a better job of leading his team forward. Clearing his throat, Thorn stood up and waited for the low murmur to die down.\"Is everyone ready to go?\" A few scattered affirmations drifted from the crowd, causing Thorn's heart to sink. The atmosphere was worse than he had thought. Keeping his face covered in a cheerful grin, Thorn let the silence return as he swept his eyes across the crowd. \"We've got an uphill battle coming. Let's be real about our situation. We lost a major advantage to Ragnarok, an advantage that they have capitalized on. Our reports tell us that they were the first to break through to the final stage of the quest. This is going to give them an advantage in the fight that is coming up, as they'll get to face off against the main boss. We can't change what has happened, but we can do a better job than we have been, and finish this quest cleanly.\"We are going to be spawning in the underground fortress, which Ragnarok currently controls. The spawn point is about three blocks from the entrance to the dungeon, so we should be able to cover the distance quickly. However, we've thrown away any pretense of peace with Ragnarok, so expect both Ragnarok and their subordinate guilds to get in our way. We'll be going in hot, so to speak. I would assume that we'll be up against at least one hundred Silver Guard and five or six hundred of their henchmen. The last time we met, we couldn't even survive against fifty, but now we'll probably face twice that number, so prepare yourselves. \"I've asked a few of our allies for some help to ensure that we can get to the dungeon, but even if we do make it through the players standing in our way, the real challenge will start from there. Once we are in the labyrinth, we'll be on a clock. We are racing against all of the major guilds in the game to try and be one of the first groups to make it through the labyrinth to the final fight. While this would have been a simple thing before, Ragnarok leaked the solution to the labyrinth, so all of the major guilds know the secret to beating it.\"Once we arrive in the final fight, we are going to have to cooperate with the other guilds, including Ragnarok, to take down the boss. Fighting alongside the other guilds against Courdum the Stone King, the boss of this World Quest, will require that we take on our boss while watching our backs, since I don't trust Ragnarok to play clean. They have shown again and again that they are more than willing to play dirty tricks if they feel like it will benefit them.\"By this time, not a sound could be heard besides the slow, heavy rumble of Thorn's voice. Mina stared at the Titan skeptically as she heard his words. If the atmosphere had been slightly down before, it had now sunk into complete depression. \"We are facing an uphill battle. But that isn't a bad thing.\" Thorn's quiet tone suddenly gained an edge, and a fire sprang up in his eyes. \"We are stronger than they know. Stronger than we know. The flame of adversity will sharpen our edge. The doubt we face will strengthen our resolve. Nothing will stand in our way. We will enter the dungeon. We will break through the labyrinth. And we will conquer whatever waits behind those doors, over the bodies of those who seek to stop us, if necessary.\"Excellence is the fruit of unrelenting focus and labor, and now it is time to prove it by our blood and sweat. Take up your weapons once more and follow me. Ragnarok thinks they have us beaten, thinks that they have us defeated. Let's show them how terribly wrong they are. Our swords will leave an impression on Ragnarok that will never be forgotten. We might have fallen once, covered by the cloud of defeat, but we are the new moon and our rise is inevitable.\"With his final word, Thorn's voice was almost a whisper, the power of his statements vibrating in the chests of the gathered players. Eyes burning, one of the tanks unsheathed his sword and thrust it into the air, his teeth clenched with determination. Around him a sea of weapons rose silently, a testament to the determination Thorn had awoken in the hearts of the Titan squad. Lifting his gauntleted hand, Thorn slowly clenched it into a fist. The clock counting down the death penalty ticked down to single digits, the intensity slowly building as the number dropped. By the time the countdown reached three seconds, the atmosphere was electric.\"Let's show them how we rise.\"\u00a0-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

Around him, the rest of the Titan squad popped into view as they entered the game. Accepting the re-spawn fee, Thorn checked his messages and walked out the large open door. The fortress was still in complete disrepair from the building-smashing fight against the stone legion and the giant stone statues that had allowed Ragnarok capture the fortress. Rather than putting money into fixing it, the super guild had let it continue to deteriorate, focusing entirely on the dungeon. Outside of the temple, a silver band of players stood in neat rows. Around one hundred Silver Guard were in the front of the group with close to two hundred players from the Silver Squires behind them. Surrounding the silver armored block, a motley collection of players from other guilds milled around as they waited for the fireworks. \"Are you Thorn?\" The question caught Thorn off guard and his foot almost missed the step. Catching himself, he looked around. Not a single player in the area came up past his shoulder, giving him a clear view of the serious-faced Silver Guard who spoke.\"Yeah. I'm Thorn.\"\"Greetings, Thorn. I am GildedShield, the acting captain of the Silver Guard.\"\"Where is Raeth? I assumed he would have already respawned.\" \"Sir Raeth has passed the honor of leading this engagement to me and joined Sir Sylith in the quest to topple the evil tyrant Courdum.\" GildedShield stood up a little straighter as he explained the situation to Thorn. Behind him, the ranks of the Silver Guard stood straight, their swords in their hands and their shields held in front of their chests. Thorn could see a red band around GildedShield's arm, marking him out as the highest ranked officer.\"Why is he talking funny?\" Thorn leaned down and asked Mina in a whisper.\"RP. He is one of those roleplayers. Some people take this game really seriously and like to pretend that this is real life. They don't treat it like a game.\"\"With a name like GildedShield? Weird.\" Straightening, Thorn pointed at the Silver Guard who were standing in their way. \"Captain, we intend to pass through this road and enter the dungeon.\"\"Acting Captain, not Captain,\" GildedShield corrected, holding up a hand. \"Due to the command of Sir Sylith, the Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight, who has decreed that no one may use this fortress' entrance to the dungeon, I have no choice but to deny your request. You....! Wai...!\"*BANG*A massive chunk of stone that had once been a pillar attached to the temple smashed down on the front line of the Silver Guard, instantly crushing GildedShield and a dozen of the silver-armored players. His hand still extended from the throw, Thorn shook his head.\"It was not a request. All units, charge!\"From the surrounding darkness, a massive army of players rose up and charged forward, throwing off their dark cloaks as they attacked. In the flickering torchlight of the underground fortress, they had blended in almost perfectly with the ruined buildings, allowing their attack to come as a complete surprise. The abrupt assault threw the milling players and the Silver Squires into utter chaos as they scrambled to defend themselves. In the front of the group, the Silver Guard responded with the strict discipline they were famous for, gathering up into a solid block, their shields held high.\"Titan squad, follow me.\" Thorn snapped out the command as he picked up another fallen pillar from where it rested on the steps. Holding it in front of him, he charged down the steps toward the Silver Guard, throwing back his head to howl as he went.\"[Rallying Cry]!\"As the Titan squad's speed increased with [Pack Travel], Thorn led them at an angle, hitting the corner of the Silver Guard's defensive formation. Sweeping the stone pillar across the Silver Guard, Thorn's eyes caught the ripple of silver energy as the shields dispersed the force of the hit across the whole formation. Still, the weight of the strike caused the Silver Guard to shiver as each player tried to stop themselves from staggering backward.Not even blinking as the pillar disintegrated into a mass of shards, Thorn grabbed two of the Silver Guard and threw them aside. Taking an abrupt turn, he faced the main body of the Silver Guard formation head on. \"Keep following Mina.\" His loud voice carried easily over the din of the battlefield, and behind him, Mina led the rest of the Titan squad to charge forward, cutting past the Silver Guard at an angle.Thorn pulled the oversized warhammer out of his inventory and began to pound down on the nearest Silver Guard, trying to buy time for all fifty of the Titan squad to get by. The area outside the temple had devolved into pure chaos as swarms of players poured out of the ruined buildings and rushed into battle. In the flickering torchlight visibility dropped to next to nothing as spells and missiles began to fly. It was only Thorn, in his bright silver armor, who stood out, his warhammer smashing down on the Silver Guard's shields. In the fury and bustle, his large form was easy to see, and he soon found himself the target of countless ranged attacks as the panicking players looked for a target. Feeling his health jump up and down as the support characters behind him threw heals at him to counteract the ranged attacks, Thorn did his best to continue smashing away on the Silver Guard. \"[Aegis of Time]!\"An arcane clock shimmered into existence above Thorn's head, neatly intercepting the thick beam of light from the Silver Guard's [Holy Strike]. As the clock melted away under the golden light, the last player from the Titan squad passed behind Thorn, and he threw back his head as if he was going to howl.At the sight of his head going up, the Silver Guard tightened their formation, raising their shields to cover their faces. With plenty of experience fighting against Thorn, they had figured out many of his tells, and knew that [Wolf Lord's Howl] was on its way. Pleased to see their shields up, Thorn stayed silent, turning to dash after the Titan squad, who were quickly disappearing into the darkness. Tossing a dark cloak around his shoulders as he ran, Thorn drew it around him, doing his best to cover his silver armor. As his large stride carried him away, he spotted Asher standing on the roof of a ruined building nearby. The leader of Aurum was watching the chaos below with a critical eye and murmuring commands to a few players who stood next to him.Giving Asher a short wave, Thorn sped off after the Titan squad, quickly catching up to the group. On the top of the building, Asher watched the Titan squad head toward the dungeon entrance. Once they had covered half the distance, he gave another command and the roiling mass of players shifted, flooding into the space left by the Titan squad's charge.The Silver Guard huddled together, waiting for a [Wolf Lord's Howl] that never came. After a few seconds, a couple of the players started to lower their shields but then hesitated. Finally, one of them straightened and dropped his shield, only to find that Thorn had disappeared. Stunned, he looked around for the Titan, only finding darkness and chaos. The crush of players rushing around suddenly turned and scattered, disappearing into the ruins of the fortress as fast as they had arrived, the dark cloaks they donned making them difficult targets in the gloom. Within minutes, the only players on the street were the tightly packed Silver Guard in their defensive formation and the beleaguered remnants of the Silver Squires.Thorn and the Titan squad rushed down the last block before the dungeon entrance. A smattering of Silver Squires stood in front of it to try and keep other players away, but the Titan squad blew through them with little effort and entered the dungeon gate. Selecting Diving mode, Thorn brought the team inside, appearing in the now familiar forge room.\"Whew. That was exciting.\" Thorn looked around with a grin as he put away his cloak. \"We'll pause for two minutes, and then we're heading in. We are going to be moving fast, so prepare yourselves, alright?\"\"Haha, that was fun.\" Mina was beaming, even as her face began to take on a pink hue in the intense heat. The two minute break went quickly, but the players in the Titan squad were professional and were back on their feet and ready to go with plenty of time to spare. Taking a tighter and more aggressive formation, they rushed forward, Thorn taking point. The labyrinth was burning hot, and fast movement made that heat all the more evident, but this was a race against the clock, so the Titan squad pushed on without regard. Following the map that Baxby had given him, Thorn led the way forward. Fire elementals they came across were obliterated into puddles of molten stone by ranged attacks before the team even got close, and traps were walked around, thanks to the detailed map. After fifteen minutes of moving as quickly as they could, the team arrived at a set of double doors that hid the first lock.\"Take two, folks. Mina, any chance you can help everyone cool down a bit?\" Completely fine himself, Thorn could see the clear lines of sweat drenching his companions.\"Sure thing. Everyone group up.\" Summoning an avalanche of snow, Mina forcefully held it up in the air until the snow began to melt, and icy water dripped down like rain on the players below. The freezing water quickly evaporated, bringing a small measure of relief to the overheated team. \"Thanks. Let's get this done.\" Thorn straightened himself up to his full height and pushed on the doors, forcing them open with a long and loud creak. Dust fell from the ceiling as the doors scraped across the floor, clearing to reveal an elite fire elemental floating in front of a six foot tall pillar. A depression in the center of the pillar held the same shape as one of the stone keys, but the elite fire elemental was too close to be avoided.As the elite fire elemental spotted them, Thorn burst into action. Ignoring the drawn back arm and the rapidly condensing [Fire Spear], Thorn burst forward with [Shadow Dash], flickering in and out out of sight as he closed the distance.\"Cover him!\" Mina called out, readying her stun in case something went wrong. However, even before one of the supporting players could throw out a bubble, Thorn's gauntleted hand was wrapped around the elite fire elemental's arm. Forcefully pulling it down, Thorn angled the [Fire Spear] toward the floor and stabbed his other hand through the monster's chest, causing it to explode into a shower of lava. As soon as the elite fire elemental started to disintegrate, Thorn jumped backward, avoiding the molten rock. Turning to Mina as he patted his hands together to put out the residual flames from the elite fire elemental's burning body, Thorn grinned.\"I think you are right. When I focus on eliminating enemies, instead of worrying about guarding against them, things go much smoother.\"\"You are ridiculous.\" Rolling her eyes, Mina ran over and took the stone key Thorn was pulling out of his inventory. Carefully stepping around the slowly cooling lava, she slotted the key into the impression in the pillar. With a flash of red light, the key merged with the pillar. A burning hiss sounded as the light ran around the edge of the key, causing it to become part of the pillar.\"Um, now what?\" Not hearing or seeing anything else, Mina looked around.\"No idea.\" Thorn shrugged and slapped the top of the pillar as he looked around. \"We need to figure out how to activate this thing.\"*CREAK*With a loud groan, the pillar sank into the ground, and the entire dungeon began to rumble. Walls began to slide apart and doorways disappeared into the ground as the walls rotated to reveal new passages. Under the Titan squad's astonished eyes, the entire layout of the dungeon changed completely.\"Huh, no wonder no one could find their way through the labyrinth. How many of those keys do we have?\" Mina asked, as she watched the labyrinth changing around them in wonder.\"Three. We've used the first.\"\"Wow, it is like we have been trying to solve three different labyrinths at the same time, except you can't see two of them.\"\"Yeah, we're lucky to have Oberlin, Corvo and Baxby, otherwise we probably wouldn't have ever solved it.\" Turning to the rest of the team, he held up his hand for their attention. \"Alright, let's keep moving. We're on the clock, folks.\"Once again, Thorn led the charge through the new pathways of the labyrinth. The map that had made no sense before now showed a clear path to the next pillar they had to activate. This time, however, the fire elementals were more common and it took a bit more coordination to wipe them out. The path to the second pillar led them through the familiar furnace room where they had been ambushed, and as soon as he stepped into it, feelings of guilt started to creep into Thorn's chest. Even though the signs of the fight had been removed, Thorn couldn't help but remember the scattered gear and the broken floor that had resulted from his whole team being wiped out. Seeing the look on his face, Mina stopped next to him and patted his arm.\"What is done is done. And you're not going to do it again, so why worry about it?\"\"Thanks.\" His friend's words brought Thorn's mind back to the present. She was right, the past was gone, forever etched into reality by time's firm tool. But he could do better in the future. And he would. Without another glance at the furnace, Thorn rushed into the center of the room, crushing the last of the fire elementals that had not fallen to the team's ranged attacks with a backhanded slap. Passing through the room, they continued to advance, soon arriving at the second pillar, where they found two elite fire elementals floating together.\"This is going to be a bit of a tighter fight, so get ready to bubble me. We're going to handle this the same way we did for the big fights when we got the keys. Everyone ready?\" As all of the support players nodded, Thorn rolled his shoulders and took a deep breath, leading the way forward.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

Once the surface of the pillar was smooth, Thorn pushed it down into the ground and looked around in expectation. This time, instead of the whole labyrinth changing, the pillar's descent only affected a single wall at the end of the room.A loud rumble sounded as the wall rotated, revealing a large set of doors made from stone and covered in carvings. Thick and foreboding, the doors gave off a dangerous aura, as if they held back a ferocious beast. Still, the Titan squad faced them with excitement in their eyes. They had made it to the last of the three pillars and defeated the three elite fire elementals who guarded it without much struggle, and now, at the end of their dungeon run, they could not wait to see what was on the other side.With one final shudder, the wall came to a stop, and the two doors began to creak open, a dense mist rolling from the crack. Little by little, the doors opened until they stood wide, revealing a darkness so deep it seemed to devour the flickering light. Taking a deep breath, Thorn glanced down at Mina.\"You ready for this?\"\"Please, I'm always ready. I've never not been ready. The question is, are you ready?\"\"I dunno. But I guess there is only one way to find out, huh?\" Forcefully suppressing the nervousness in his chest, Thorn turned around to address the team. \"Alright. This is it. Beyond those doors we will be facing our biggest challenge to date. Sylith and the Silver Guard are already over there, and who knows, we might find some of the other major guilds over there, as well. Either way, we will be competing against the best. I really don't have much to say except, let's get in there and show them what we can do.\"Giving an excited yell, Mina led the way, rushing forward into the doorway, Thorn and the rest of the team following close behind. As Thorn plunged into the darkness, he felt himself slowing down slightly, as if space itself was thickening around him. With a slight popping sound, he appeared in a new space, light bursting around him. *ding* The Titan squad found themselves on a wide platform, floating in a massive cavern. At the center of the cavern, a gigantic jar shaped like a huge heart rose into the air, a blackish mist dripping down from hundreds of openings. Around the stone heart floated large stone platforms, ascending like a colossal spiral staircase.Each platform was close to three hundred feet in diameter, made of the same smooth stone as the floor of the labyrinth. With one edge only a few feet from the jar, the platforms floated above an endlessly dark pit, and Thorn's heart chilled as he imagined falling off. The spiraled platforms, which looked like they had been ripped from the ground, appeared to be fixed in the air, giving Thorn a measure of relief. Looking toward the center of the room, he noticed a platform that was different from the rest.Above the giant stone heart in the center of the cavern, a smaller platform hovered, supported by three massive greater elementals who floated above the opening at the top of the heart-shaped jar. Thick chains bound the greater elementals to the platform, coursing energy running across them as their strength was constantly drawn out and fed into the throne. Two sets of chains dangled from the platform where the greater fire elemental and the greater air elemental had been bound, hanging empty over the jar's opening. The top of the platform was dominated by a golden throne covered in strange runic motifs and, sitting on the oversized seat, was a robed dwarf with a tall, spiky crown holding a twisted staff that pulsed with a sickly green light.Despite the distance, Thorn could make out nine large statues surrounding the throne. A quick examination revealed that there were ten floating platforms forming the spiral staircase, meaning that one group would not have to face one of the stone guards. The top position was held by Ragnarok and the Silver Guard, as evidenced by the gleam of polished silver armor. What surprised Thorn was that the second position was held by a team from Eastern Alliance in their matching tabards. Nova Luna held the third platform, located about fifty feet below the top of the jar. The platforms below were all currently empty, waiting for teams to finish the labyrinth portion of the dungeon. Thorn was just settling in to wait when he got a notification.*ding*Opening up the video chat request, Thorn saw BurningCloud's lovely face smiling at him.\"Hey Thorn, I'm starting a video chat for all of the team leaders so we can coordinate this fight. Give me a second.\" Within a few seconds Sylith's image appeared next to BurningCloud's window.\"I see you made it.\" Sylith grinned at Thorn, his words dripping with mockery. \"Yup. Didn't even need to steal someone else's accomplishments to do it.\" Thorn kept his tone as neutral as possible.\"Hey, cut it out, you two,\" BurningCloud interrupted before Sylith could get his response out. \"I don't care how you got here, save your feud until after we crush this boss.\"\"Fine. As long as they don't drag us down, I'll keep it civil.\" \"Thorn, what about you? Can Nova Luna work with us?\" BurningCloud turned her eyes to Thorn.\"Of course.\" Thorn nodded, his face serious. \"You don't have to worry, we are not into backstabbing our allies like some guilds.\"\"Good. We'll wait for the others to arrive, and then we'll talk about the plan. Bye for now.\" Signing off, Thorn sat down next to Mina. The whole team had settled on the ground as comfortably as they could as they prepared to wait for ten teams to pass through the dungeon. After a few moments of silence, Mina couldn't stand it anymore and turned to Thorn.\"Where is Akira? I haven't seen her in a while.\"\"Honestly, I'm not sure. She ran off into the valley, and I haven't seen her since. I was going to try and summon her, but I figured she must be busy.\"\"Aww, you're so cute. You know, you are probably the only player in the whole game who treats your pets like they are people.\"\"Well, her family is around, and she hasn't seen them in a while, so I thought she might want to spend some time with them.\"\"Haha, that is exactly what I'm talking about. Literally no one would care if their pet wanted to see their family, especially if their pet was as strong as Akira. Combat pets are rare enough, but combat pets with healing are even rarer. It is like getting a free extra player on your team, but you let her run off to see her family just because. Hey, I'm not saying it like it's a bad thing. It is just funny.\"Listening to Mina chatting as they waited, Thorn did his best to relax. The massive jar in the center of the room with the black mist continually pouring out of it was making him quite nervous, but he did his best to focus on Mina's casual conversation. Something about the mist reminded him of Karrandaras and the devils he fought in the Battlefield of Flame and Shadow, though he could not pinpoint exactly what it was.Nearly three hours passed before the next team arrived, but once they did, it was like a sluice gate had opened, and the teams poured in, quickly filling the platforms. As the fourth group, a team from a guild called Mirage, entered from the water section of the labyrinth the greater water elemental gave a pleased roar, its chains falling away. With a swirl, it transformed into a single point of water that then vanished into the air. Without its support the platform with the throne dipped lower toward the massive jar's opening.By the time the tenth team arrived, all of the bound greater elementals had been freed. Giving off excited roars, the thick chains that restrained them fell limp and they disappeared. Up on the platform, Courdum could only watch in rage as the greater elementals vanished back to the planes they came from, causing the platform to drop down, getting ever closer to the mouth of the jar.By the time the last greater elemental had disappeared, the platform had landed on the jar, sealing the top and connecting neatly with the first platform where Sylith and the Silver Guard stood. At first Courdum's guards stirred, but sensing no movement from the Silver Guard, they soon settled back down.*ding*Opening up his chat, Thorn rejoined the group message that BurningCloud started. The chat was filled with leaders from the ten groups that made it through the labyrinth. Apart from Sylith, whose face held an unconcealed pride, and BurningCloud, whose demeanor gave off the impression that she was in charge of the group, the rest of the group leaders looked at each other with grudging respect. Without the information that Ragnarok had shared, many of these guild leaders would not even have been able to make it through the first stages of the labyrinth. It was only after they learned about the dwarven earth maps and stone keys that they had been able to marshal their resources to complete the labyrinth.As Thorn looked over them, he quickly realized that all of them had less than fifty players, a testament to the difficulty of the dungeon. It only highlighted for him how abnormal his gaming experience really was. \"Ehem. Looks like everyone is here.\" BurningCloud cleared her throat for attention before speaking in a businesslike tone. \"First of all, congratulations to everyone who made it this far. I'm sure there were a lot of other people aiming for your spots. I'd also like to say thank you to Ragnarok for sharing the information about the dungeon.\"His expression unchanging, Sylith nodded slightly as everyone else looked on enviously.\"And I would also like to personally thank Thorn and Nova Luna for being such a big help to me and my team.\" This time BurningCloud flashed a wide smile at Thorn, causing a number of the other leaders to turn to the Titan, their eyes filled with jealousy. For some reason, as soon as Thorn saw the beautiful guild leader's smile, Velin's face immediately popped into his mind, causing him to blink.\"Let's move on to the fight.\" Sylith's voice cut through Thorn's thoughts, bringing him back to the present. \"Sure.\" with an easy smile, BurningCloud swept her eyes across all of the team leaders. \"As I said earlier, good job for making it here. The fact that you are here is a good indication that you and your teams are some of the strongest players in the game. Which is good, because we are going to need 100 percent of that strength for this boss battle. Sylith, would you explain what we are up against?\"\"Mhm. This fight is a fairly straightforward one, though it is really tough. You can see that there are ten platforms, each platform will have to fight a boss guard statue. Once the fight starts, the guards will teleport to the filled platforms, which is why we had to wait until all the platforms were filled to start. Otherwise, the guards would double up on a platform. When we first came in, we started the fight without waiting and got to fight all of the guards plus Courdum himself.\"I'm sure that you heard that it did not go well. The guards are easily as tough as a world boss. Anyway, once a boss reaches fifty percent of their health, phase two starts. During phase two, all the bosses retreat back to the stone heart and drink the mist, which gives them a powerup. They gain regeneration and increased attack and strength, like a rage ability. Their defense will drop slightly during this time, but their regen evens it out.\"In addition, Courdum will begin to teleport the bosses around, allowing them to swap locations. There is an indicator as to which bosses are being swapped, so we'll call that out when it is happening. Stage two will last until the first boss drops. Once the first boss is killed, that is when things get really dangerous, so we need to drop the bosses as fast as possible once the first one falls.\"Once stage three starts, Courdum will begin to cast some of his major elemental spells. If they are not interrupted, he will wipe out whole teams. From what we saw, there were four different spells. With all of them, all you have to do is deal enough damage to him, and he will teleport away, interrupting the spell. When he hits 25 percent health or after he casts his five elemental spells, he does his ultimate spell, which turns everyone to stone. Again, as long as we can deal enough damage to him, it won't go off.\"\"Thanks. Okay.\" BurningCloud clapped her hands together. \"The fight will start in a few minutes. A couple things to take note of: This is a cooperative fight, so anyone who sabotages the fight or another team will get blacklisted. We also need to make sure that we are keeping pace with each other so we don't start stage two and three too early. If you burn down your boss a lot faster than the other teams, it will make the whole fight a lot more difficult.\"At the same time, if you cannot beat, or at least tie down, your boss, they will get the chance to double up on another team. So please make sure you at least keep them occupied. We don't need this fight snowballing out of control. Ragnarok will be responsible for fighting Courdum himself, so pay attention when they call out his teleport locations. Alright, I think that about wraps it up. Sylith, you can go ahead and get it started.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone! Are you interested in reading the rest of Book #3 and all of Book #4?

Under the brilliant illumination, Sylith's golden armor gleamed as he motioned for one of his men to walk forward to begin the fight. On each of the floating platforms, the guilds waited quietly for the battle to begin. This moment was the fruit of their hard labor, and all of them were determined to see it through to the end.As the Silver Guard player reached the edge of the first platform where it joined the platform with the throne, he paused slightly, his foot hanging. Then, decisively placing his foot on the central platform, he took a single step. As soon as his boot touched the ground, the figure on the golden throne stirred, his eyes opening wider to reveal a deep and strange madness. With a creak, all of the statues guarding the throne on the platform on top of the jar took a step forward. Climbing to his feet, Courdum the Stone King scanned the teams on the floating platforms before speaking.[Foolish mortals, why have you come here? This land is mine, yet you have fought your way in, cutting down my subjects with impunity and stealing our resources. You have destroyed the elemental seal I took so many years to create. All for what? The promise of glittering gold? Ha, that is a vice I know too well. But why must you hasten your demise? The eternal legions of stone do not welcome you, yet you have persisted in your invasion of our land.]Listening to the Stone King's surprisingly loud voice echoing around the cavern, Thorn glanced back at his team to make sure they were ready. Firm gazes met his as the players from Nova Luna waited for their enemy to appear. Without knowing which of the bosses they were going to face, Thorn instructed them to stand in a defensive formation with the tanks in a half circle around the point they thought the stone guardian would appear. Spread out behind them were the DPS and support, their weapons drawn and ready to fire.On the platform, Courdum the Stone King finally finished his speech.[Fine. If you will not submit by choice, I shall force you to submit under the boot of the Stone Legion!]Raising his staff slightly, Courdum tapped its polished end on the ground. A flash of light enveloped the large stone statues surrounding his throne. Each of the nine statues reappeared on one of the platforms, facing the dungeon teams. Only Ragnarok was spared, though Thorn was not so sure that they were lucky when he saw Courdum floating down from the throne toward their platform.The loud thump of feet brought Thorn's attention back to the boss on his platform. With a humanoid body that was only slightly larger than Thorn's, the guard that Nova Luna was facing had three large snake-heads extending from its shoulders with a thick tail at its back. Each head was a different color; green, blue, and black scales shimmered in the bright light. The three heads, each at least as long again as its body, wove in the air as the boss walked forward. Three different hues of poison dripped from the snakeheads, scorching the stone below. The stone monstrosity held two whips in its hands, flicking them back and forth like giant snake tongues.\"Tanks, block it. Watch out for spitting attacks.\" His eyes firmly fixed on the approaching boss, Thorn snapped out his order. Immediately the tanks sped into action, charging forward to intercept the stone guard. The first tank accelerated suddenly when he was only ten feet away, lowering his shoulder and smashing into the statue with his shield. With a loud booming sound, the statue staggered a step back as one of the heads fixed its eyes on the tank who had just attacked. The other two heads were scanning the approaching group of tanks, looking for threats. Not seeing anything particularly dangerous, the two heads lifted to focus on the ranged attackers who were already beginning to to pepper it with arrows and fireballs.\"Swap to a three tank rotation. We need to keep all of the heads occupied.\" Catching the change, Thorn called out for two more tanks to step forward. Unlike a normal boss, it wasn't enough to rotate a line of solo tanks through. The three heads of the stone guardian whipped around, each attacking independently and forcing Nova Luna to send three tanks up at a time to make sure that all three heads were properly aggroed.Leveling his arbalest, Thorn sent a bolt into the body of the stone statue. The metal head of the bolt slammed into the hard stone scales of the monster, leaving a gouge mark as it bounced away. The team's DPS was keeping up a steady stream of ranged attacks while the tanks rotated in groups of three, and within a few minutes the tanks firmly held the beast's attention.Mina waved her wand, sending out a barrage of icicles at the boss's green malachite head, cracking the scales around its neck. Roaring with rage, the head started to turn toward her, but before it could, a tank with a round spiked shield slammed into its leg. Hissing, the malachite head shot down, its massive teeth snapping the air where the tank had stood a second before. Jumping up from his backward roll, the tank stepped forward again, slamming his shield into the top of the creature's malachite head.\"Thorn, aggro is stable.\" Mina called out after watching the exchange. The tanks had worked themselves into a good rhythm that kept the boss completely occupied. \"Alright, let's ramp up the damage.\" At Thorn's words, the steady stream of attacks flying toward the boss suddenly increased from a trickle to a full blown torrent. Thorn began to shoot his arbalest as fast as he could, using one hand to pull back the string and load the bolt while he pulled the trigger with the other. Immediately, the strain on the tanks shot up as the increased damage from the team's DPS began to erode their control of the boss' movement.\"Leaves, how are the other teams doing?\" Thorn reloaded his arbalest and sent another bolt smashing into the boss' chest, earning himself an annoyed glance from the basalt head. Thankfully, the tanks chose that moment to rotate, and the new tank responsible for the basalt head activated her taunt ability, pulling the beast's attention back.\"Everyone seems about the same.\" The Fae Druid was keeping an eye on the other fights as he healed the Tanks. \"Everyone is using the same tactic as we are, so our progress should be relatively even.\"\"Good. It shouldn't be long before we trigger the second stage.\" Still firing his arbalest steadily, Thorn caught the flash of a Silver Guard's armor as a figure fell from the central platform. Frowning, he looked over toward the first platform where the Silver Guard still stood in gleaming rows, now minus the Silver Guard who had started the fight. Courdum the Stone King had floated from his seat to the edge of the central platform and paused there, a mere step away from the floating platform that the Silver Guard occupied. Sylith stood in front of the Silver Guard, giving Courdum plenty of space. Unlike the rest of the platforms where stone guards had been teleported, Courdum never crossed to the first platform, allowing the Silver Guard to pass this portion of the boss fight without actually fighting.Grumbling to himself, Thorn shot another bolt at the three-headed boss. The first position should have been Nova Luna's, and could have been if he had not been so overconfident. Instead, they were stuck fighting while Ragnarok stood by and watched, reaping the benefits with none of the effort. Clenching his teeth, Thorn had to forcefully restrain his anger. He wanted more than anything to jump forward and rip the stone guardian to pieces, but that would throw the fight off.BurningCloud had been clear that they needed to make sure that all the bosses' health fell at about the same rate to prevent the phases from triggering too fast, so Thorn had to hold back, contenting himself with shooting his siege crossbow. While holding a defensive posture and chipping away at the boss's health was not the most exciting way to beat it, it was a safe way, so Thorn held himself in check. \"DPS, low rotation.\" Thorn called out. Watching the boss carefully for any sign that the tanks were losing control over its aggro, he had seen two of the heads look away from their tank at the same time. As he spoke, a lightning bolt and a large fireball impacted the body of the boss right where its neck joined its body. The two elemental explosions sent small cracks running through the boss' torso. As it hissed in rage, the black and blue heads swung toward the two mages who had thrown the spells. Stretching out, the onyx head began to gather a thick black fog in its mouth that looked like the same stuff that was pouring out of the jar in the center of the cavern. At the same time, the basalt snakehead opened its mouth wide, a swirl of water gathering in front of it. The two heads aimed their attacks at the back line, but before they were able to release them, two tanks activated their abilities. \"[Enraging Cry]!\"\"[Thunder Strike]!\" A wave of sound radiated from the first tank, a burly man dressed in rough iron and fur armor, smashing into the onyx snakehead. The vibration slammed into the snake's lower jaw, forcing its head up and causing it to swallow the black mist. Small trails of mist dripped from its mouth as the head snapped around to glare at the burly tank.Next to him, the other tank had just released a slash with her large sword, aimed at the gaping maw of the basalt snakehead. With a booming sound, a large bolt of purple energy manifested itself around the sword and shot toward the swirling water energy in front of the snake's open mouth. Seeing the attack coming, the snake jerked its head around and released two pulses of water that met the bolt of purple energy in the air. \"Give the tanks time to get it back under control!\" Thorn's voice rang over the sounds of battle, and the DPS reacted instantly, dropping their attacks back to less than half of what they had been a moment before.Continuing to watch carefully, Thorn waited until the tanks had control again and then commanded the team to intensify their attacks, increasing the rate at which the boss's health dropped. Through this careful back and forth, the Titan squad slowly wore down the snake-headed boss. After nearly twenty-five minutes, the boss's health was slowly falling, its body showing signs of the constant damage that the Titan Squad was putting out.Just as Thorn thought they would be hitting the 50% mark, a scream of rage burst from the boss on the seventh platform. The stone guardian on the seventh platform was shaped like an armadillo with four large arms that stretched from its torso. Rising to its full height, the creature beat its thick fists on its chest like a gorilla. \"Here we go, folks. Stage two is about to start. Do your best to keep your bosses from getting to the black mist! But remember, we still need to kill them slowly.\" BurningCloud's voice rang out in the group chat that the leaders still had up.[Foolish mortals, you are stronger than I gave you credit for! But no amount of mortal might can stand in the way of the strength granted by the Immortal Stone Elixir. Come, my guards! Drink deep of the waters of the Stone Heart! Drink deep and show your strength!]On the central platform, Courdum the Stone King tapped his staff twice on the ground, a heavy booming sound filling the cavern as the heart shaped jar under his feet trembled. Up from its depths rose a tide of black mist, pouring out over the edge of the jar, rushing down the sides in deep streams. The thick mist looked almost like liquid as it fell, crashing into the endless pit below. As one, the stone guards threw back their heads and roared with excitement before turning and running toward the jar.\"Stop them!\" \"Use crowd control!\" \"Quick, bind its feet!\"Shouts burst from the teams as they rushed to stop the stone guards from reaching the black mist pouring down. On the third platform, the snake-headed stone guardian turned toward the jar, its heads weaving back and forth. The malachite and onyx heads turned back toward the tanks and continued to attack even as the monster ran away.\"Mina, slow it down!\"\"I'm on it! [Avalanche]! [Blizzard]!\" With Mina's words, the air around the monster turned white, the swirling snow chilling the boss's stone body. Pushing through the spell, the boss shot its blue head out of the sphere of icy blades. Opening its mouth, the basalt snakehead had its eyes fixed on the jar when it suddenly jerked to a stop, its head slamming into the ground. *BOOM* Crushing the flagstone floor, the snake-headed boss was stunned for a moment as the attacks from the Titan squad rained down its body. Trying to get out of the way of the incoming attacks, the monster scrambled forward, leaving deep gouges in the ground. Another wave of attacks hammered into its back, driving it back to the ground. Confused, the boss looked down, only to realize that it had not moved an inch. Curling around, its six eyes scanned down its tail to where a giant hand had grasped it.\"Where do you think you are going?\" Thorn's voice rumbled as he began to pull.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

On the other platforms, the stone guards were nearing the torrents of black mist pouring from the heart shaped jar, despite each team's best efforts.\"Thorn, can you keep it pinned down?\"\"As long as you can keep me alive!\"Never letting go of the stone guard's tail, Thorn pulled the creature back, his hands working their way up its body. The three heads were hissing wildly, twisting around to snap at his body. Ducking his head to avoid a bite, Thorn dug his claws into the stone guard's back and punched down, stunning the boss momentarily as his fist drove its chest into the stone floor. Recovering from the shock, the boss began to struggle furiously, trying to dislodge Thorn from its back.Thorn was about to let go so he could draw one of the weapons he had brought when he remembered his conversation with Mina. Tightening his grip, he brought his other hand down again, pounding down at the base of one of the stone guard's twisting snake heads. The blow slammed into the stone scales, pulverising them into tiny shards of stone.\"Keep him alive! Thorn will solo tank for now. I want everyone else on DPS!\" Since Thorn was tied up trying to keep the stone guardian on the ground, Mina took over, directing the support players to focus on keeping Thorn alive under the furious assault of the three snakeheads.The whole Titan squad burst into motion. Heal after heal landed on Thorn, instantly bringing him back to full health and boosting his already impressive abilities. At the same time, countless crowd control spells showered down on the boss, preventing it from being able to struggle out from under Thorn's incredible weight. The tanks turned their weapons on it, hacking down at every available inch of its body as they joined the DPS in burning through its health.Kneeling in the middle of the boss' back, Thorn focused his attacks on the center neck. Punch after punch rained down, sending shards of stone flying as his armored fist pounded through the stone scales. For the first few seconds, he had tried his best to dodge the incoming attacks from the other two heads, but once the support players started to heal him, he abandoned any attempts at defense and just attacked as fast as he could.On the second platform, Eastern Alliance had succeeded in slowing down the boss they were fighting, delaying it from reaching the jar and the black mist. BurningCloud released a searing beam of light from her sword and took a moment to glance at the other platforms. Apart from Nova Luna, whose guild leader was literally sitting on the snake-headed boss, the rest of the guilds had not been able to stop their bosses from reaching the jar.The stone guardian on the fourth platform was the first to reach the jar, sucking in a dense cloud of the black mist. Tendrils of the heavy darkness shot toward the boss, racing into the spiderweb of cracks that covered its shield. With an excited roar, the stone guardian swelled, jagged rocky growths bursting from its armor as it absorbed the mist. Lifting its mace, the armored stone guardian banged its weapon against its newly mended shield and began to charge into the team it had been fighting.On most of the platforms, the same scene repeated as the stone guards reached the waterfall of black mist and drank it greedily. The mist not only repaired some of the damage that the stone guards had taken, but also boosted their abilities, making them even more of a challenge than they had already been. Within a few minutes most of the teams had been thrown into disarray as they tried to fight with the refreshed bosses.On the second platform, BurningCloud grimaced. She had known that the fight was going to be difficult, but the other teams were struggling more than she had anticipated. A quick glance at the first platform revealed that Sylith and the Silver Guard were still in their original position, facing off against Courdum the Stone King. Her frown deepened.Thorn was not paying attention to anything except the feeling of his fist crushing through the snake-headed boss's defenses. His last punch sent a deep crack running through half of its neck, and sensing an opportunity, Thorn straightened his fingers, sending his claws into the crack. Throwing his head back, Thorn roared and pulled, his claws digging deep into the twisting stone of the onyx snake-head's neck.In desperation, the other two heads lunged for his shoulders, only to smash up against a golden barrier as one of the clerics behind Thorn waved his staff and chanted a prayer. Drawing his hand back, Thorn brought it down again, widening the crack even farther. Another bubble shimmered to life around him, preventing a spray of acid from eating into his armor.His mind focused, Thorn paid no attention to the flailing attacks of the other heads and, with a final strike, broke the middle neck from the boss' body. Ignoring the furious hisses from the other heads, Thorn threw the still-writhing snakehead off of the platform. Under his knee, the struggles of the stone guardian grew weaker as its already low health plunged to rock bottom.At the same moment, up on the top platform, Courdum and Sylith were having a staring contest. The ancient Dwarven king floated four feet off the ground, looking down at the Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight. Still on the central platform, he seemed to be waiting for Sylith to make a move. Yet Sylith stood like a statue, his shield held in front of his body and his lance pointed up in the air.As they held the silent face off, Courdum's eyes shifted slightly. Both the Dwarven king and the Silver Guard could clearly hear the shattering sound as Thorn ripped one of the snake heads from the stone guard's body. His eyes widening imperceptibly, the sound reminded Sylith of the bruising fight he had experienced against the Titan two days earlier, and the memory almost made him flinch. Holding himself extra still, Sylith managed to restrain himself.Courdum was not so restrained and lifted his staff slightly, waving it in a small circle. With a silent puff of black mist, Courdum's entire body disintegrated into dust, crumbling away as if he was an ancient statue unable to stand the wear of time. Near his throne, his figure appeared again and, with a motion, he floated down to stand on top of it.[You dare strike down my guards? Foolish mortals, your arrogance knows no bounds!]The echo of his voice still ringing around the room, Courdum muttered an arcane phrase and traced a symbol in the air in front of him. With a few motions he traced out a rough looking heart surrounded by ten arcane symbols. The black mist from the jar below him surged suddenly as Courdum tapped the seventh and third symbols.On the seventh platform, the multi-armed armadillo stone guardian had been the first to fall below 50 percent health, but the activation of the second phase had completely turned its situation around. The team fighting it had not been able to stop it from gulping down the black mist, repairing some of the damage it had taken and causing large stone bumps to grow from its thick armored back.Curling itself into a ball, it was throwing itself forward with crushing force, scattering any players in its way. Using its four arms to control its direction, the stone guardian swung by the edge of the platform when a thick tendril of black mist reached out and pulled it up into the air. Under the relieved stares of the players on the seventh platform, it vanished, only to appear in the air above the third platform.Silently, Sylith watched as Courdum completed his spell, teleporting the stone guardian from the seventh platform up to the third. The Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight had started to speak when Courdum began to cast his spell, but seeing that the stone guardian was being sent to Nova Luna's platform, he held his tongue. The first indication that anyone from Nova Luna received that another stone guardian was about to arrive was the thunderous sound of the armadillo statue landing on the platform.*BOOM*The noise was so loud that it shook Thorn from his single-minded attempt to rip the second head off of the stone guardian trapped under his knee.\"Watch out!\" As the new stone guardian started to roll toward the Titan squad, Mina shouted out and thrust her wand forward. \"[Ice Wall]!\"From the ground burst thick walls of ice, their ends pointed toward the approaching boss to provide as much resistance as possible. Summoning more [Ice Wall]s, all stacked together at a slight angle, Mina hurried the team to run to the other side of the platform to avoid the armadillo's charge. Within moments, the whole team had shifted, leaving Thorn, who was still pinning the snake-headed stone guardian to the ground, in the incoming boss's path.The armadillo stone guardian burst through the [Ice Wall] like it was paper, sending chunks of ice flying. Barely slowed by the barrier, it barreled toward Thorn. The four arms pushed off the ground, accelerating rapidly, as the thick stone growths ground apart the flagstones, shaking the whole platform.\"Thorn!\"Gritting his teeth, Thorn abandoned his attempt to rip the second snake head off of the stone guardian and grabbed it tightly. Throwing himself backwards, Thorn rolled onto his back, carrying the struggling snake-headed stone guardian with him. Digging his feet into the ground, he roared and braced for the impact.*CRUNCH*With a tremendous sound the armadillo's spiky armor hit the snake-headed stone guardian dead on. Behind it, Thorn groaned under the weight of the armadillo's strike, his feet cutting two deep furrows into the platform. The snake-headed stone guardian gave a choking cry and fell limp, its entire body crushed by the armadillo stone guard's attack. Underneath its body, Thorn could feel blood streaming down his arms and legs. For a brief moment, his mind flashed back to his life in the real world, and he was shocked by how accurate the game had gotten the feeling of having your skin rip open.\"[Rallying Cry]! [Call the Pack]!\" As heavy as the hit was, Thorn was still able to activate both of his area of effect support abilities, instantly increasing his regeneration. The long lacerations that the force of the attack had cut into his skin began to knit together, and he stood with a grunt, throwing aside the corpse of the snake-headed stone guardian.\"Heal him up!\" Snapping out a command, Mina leveled her wand and unleashed a storm of ice around the armadillo, which had begun to uncurl in confusion.\"Watch out, phase three just started!\" BurningCloud's voice carried clearly around the cavern, startling all of the teams that were still fighting against stone guards. Standing on the second platform, she shot a glare at Sylith, who just snorted and looked away. His attempt to cause trouble for Nova Luna by not letting them know that Courdum was teleporting another boss had resulted in the third phase starting way sooner than it should.The plan had been that they would clear all of the stone guards around the same time to make it easier to deal with Courdum when he teleported and began to cast a new spell. With the stone guards still having the majority of their health, the teams would not be able to focus on preventing Courdum from casting his spells. Cursing under her breath, BurningCloud commanded her team to burn down the boss they were facing as fast as possible.Courdum the Stone King began to float up into the air from where he had landed on his wide throne after the second phase started. The symbol in front of him began to grow at his command, each arcane word that tumbled from his lips adding to the symbol's complexity. Just as his toes left the seat of the golden throne, his staff tapped down.*BOOM*The jar in the center of the cavern shook again, and the black mist that had been tumbling down suddenly stopped moving. Slowly it began to reverse direction, climbing back up the sides of the jar and gathering in a tiny ball in the center of the heart symbol that Courdum had drawn. Even more mist came creeping through the cracks between the central platform and the jar's opening, flowing over the edge to join the mist rushing up to the symbol. Slowly at first, but then faster and faster, the mist that had fallen into the pit crawled back up the jar, sending a shiver down the spines of the players watching it.A sliver of black mist flowed from the eyes of one of the stone guards who had drunk it earlier, causing its body to shrink slightly. With a scream of pain, the stone guardian grabbed at its eye, only to find another slip of mist streaming from its ear. On every platform that still had a stone guardian the same thing began to happen, driving the stone guards into an unbridled fury. With enraged roars, they began to go crazy, launching attacks indiscriminately.The black mist continued to gather, forced into the symbol of the heart as Courdum continued to chant. Waving his staff, the ancient Dwarven king's words began to gain a guttural and alien tone. In between his words, a chorus of chittering voices could be heard echoing around the cavern.\"Sylith!\" BurningCloud yelled, shocking the players out of their mad scramble to defend themselves against the enraged stone guards. Facing the armadillo stone guard, Thorn kicked aside the corpse of the snake-headed boss and lunged forward. Two arms were met with four as Thorn and the stone guardian rammed into each other and began wrestling back and forth.On the first platform, Sylith took a slow step forward, his lance lowering to point at Courdum the Stone King. Behind him, the Silver Guard took a step forward, as well, their metal boots hitting the stone floor with a uniform crash. The sudden sound drew all attention to their silver figures. Poised to charge, Sylith looked around, his eyes sweeping over the teams still struggling with stone guards and eventually settling on Thorn, who was locked together with the four armed armadillo. With a slight smile, he nodded at Thorn and then laughed, causing Thorn's heart to fall into the pit of his stomach.With a shimmer, the Silver Guard logged out.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

Still holding down the struggling Armadillo boss, Thorn's eyes narrowed as he stared at the spot where Sylith's figure had just been. Just as he was about to turn his head toward Mina, his eye caught the symbols in front of Courdum the Stone King. The ancient Dwarven king spun his staff in a strange pattern, the end glowing a brilliant orange, and thrust it toward the tenth symbol.All at once, the tenth platform was consumed by an apocalyptic firestorm. Massive burning chunks of stone appeared above the platform, shooting down upon the players. At the same time, the stone cracked and broke as geysers of superheated gas erupted from the platform. The meteors that impacted the platform blasted players right and left, sending some flying off the edges and into the abyss below. The other teams could only watch in horror as the tenth platform turned into a burning hellscape. Between the molten stone raining down and the volcanic eruptions rising to the surface, the temperature rose so high that the ninth platform seemed in danger of melting. On the central platform, Courdum pulled back his staff and continued to channel the black mist into the heart. As suddenly as the spell had begun, it was over, the ground cooling with loud pops. Stunned, the other groups watched as the haze cleared, revealing the blistered and broken platform, not a single player on it. Almost as one, all eyes turned back to Courdum, who hovered over the central platform, the silvery energy gathering at the tip of his staff. \"Sylith!\" Once again, BurningCloud's voice echoed throughout the cavern, but this time it was inflamed with rage. \"That sneaky...\" Mina ground her teeth. \"I'm glad I left that guild!\"\"Hah. They do have a knack for this sort of thing.\" Feeling the armadillo stone guardian trying to struggle free, Thorn tightened his grip. \"But right now we have to figure out what we're going to do.\"\"I'm hereby blacklisting Sylith and Ragnarok.\" BurningCloud's furious face appeared in the leaders' group chat. Her glare raked over the remaining leaders. \"And anyone else that tries to undermine us!\"Blanching, a few of the leaders who had considered logging out with their teams put the thought away and began to direct their teams to take down the stone guards on their platforms. The worst that would happen is that they would have a full team wipe. While dying was no small thing, it was nothing compared to being blacklisted by the Eastern Alliance, and with how angry BurningCloud was right now, no one was willing to risk it.On the third platform, Thorn was struggling back and forth with the four-armed armadillo, which was trying to lift him from the ground. With a grunt, Thorn dropped his weight down into his hips and rotated his torso slightly, kicking out with one of his legs at the same moment. His metal-clad toe smashed into the statue's leg, sending a massive crack through it. Grimacing as pain shot through his toes, Thorn planted his aching foot and heaved.With a roar, Thorn lifted the stone guardian up in the air and then slammed it to the ground as hard as he possibly could. Shaking free of its four hands, Thorn's eyes swept across his team. Mina, as if able to read his mind, grinned and winked.\"Better to die doing something, boss. Leave this guy to us.\"\"Thanks.\" Nodding to the Ice Witch, Thorn turned and began to sprint toward the edge of the platform. Mina brandished her wand and called the rest of the Titan squad to attention, summoning a deluge of snow over the armadillo boss.\"Tanks, lock it down!\"Reaching the edge of the platform, Thorn measured the distance with his eyes and bounded forward, launching himself into the air. For a moment his huge body hung in the air, and the immensity of the pit below washed over him. Pushing aside the rising panic, Thorn focused his eyes on the rapidly approaching wall of the massive jar. Black mist was still rising from the pit, thin tendrils reaching toward Thorn as he came closer. Blasting through the mist, Thorn hit the side of the jar with a thump, nearly bouncing off. Incredibly focused, he slapped his hands on the side of the jar and dug his claws in. Catching his weight, he was stabilizing himself when his right hand suddenly slipped, the jar crumbling under his grip. For an agonizing moment he dangled over the pit, hanging by a single hand.On the ninth platform a forest of stone spikes burst forth, stabbing into the players as Courdum lit up another symbol. Impossibly sharp, the stone spikes cut through armor as if it were made of dry leaves, sending dozens of players out of the game instantly. A few of the players who reacted fast enough activated their bubbles, keeping themselves alive as the stone spike pushed them into the air. Before they could relax, the spikes suddenly branched out, growing large thorns that ripped through the bubbles and decimated the rest of the players. Courdum the Stone King withdrew his staff, the earthy yellow glow fading away from its tip. On the other platforms, many of the players were glancing at Thorn. A player on the sixth platform nudged his companion and pointed at Thorn's figure.\"What on earth is he doing?\"\"You're asking me, who am I supposed to ask?\" The mage shrugged. \"Besides, will it even matter? Those spells are going to wipe us all out.\"Up above, on the second platform, BurningCloud shook her head, a reluctant grin slipping onto her face. Uncomfortable with the idea of giving up, she had forced everyone to stay and finish the fight, but truthfully, she had no real hope of winning. Once the initial flash of anger had worn off, BurningCloud was wracking her brain for a solution, all the while feeling less and less hope. Now, watching Thorn struggle to climb the jar, the hope which had nearly been extinguished was starting to rekindle. There was something about the Titan that inspired inexplicable confidence.His legs swinging freely, Thorn pulled a sword from his inventory and stabbed it into the side of the jar, releasing a gush of black mist. Testing his weight on the sword, Thorn was worried that it was about to snap, so he pulled on it slightly, causing it to bend alarmingly. Quickly dropping it, Thorn shoved his fingers back into the jar, making sure he did not close his fist like the last time.Pulling himself up, Thorn reached up and jammed his other hand into the jar, slowly beginning his climb up the side of the jar toward the platform where Courdum floated. The heart-shaped symbol pulsed in front of the ancient Dwarven king as it continued to absorb the black mist. On the end of Courdum's staff the blue glow had reached a searing brilliance and with a flourish, he jammed it into the eighth symbol.\"Oh no.\" On the eighth platform a swirling storm materialized above the heads of the panic-stricken players. The leader of the team looked up toward BurningCloud, despair evident in his eyes. Massive drops of rain began to plummet toward the platform, splashing against the stone like grenades. Tiny drops of water shot into the air with the fall of each drop, knocking players from their feet. One player, trying to get away from one raindrop, dove to the side, only to get hit on the back with another. Driven into the ground, they found themselves completely stunned, unable to respond as raindrops hammered into them. Faster and faster the rain poured down, knocking the players around like ragdolls.Up on the second, platform BurningCloud bit her lip. As much as she wanted everyone to stay and fight, she couldn't, in good conscience, force the other teams to stay just to die. The spells that Courdum the Stone King was releasing were exactly as Sylith had said. Each one was wiping out a team. Glancing at the central platform where the heart symbol was filling with black mist, she cursed the Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight under her breath.\"Fine, I won't pursue you for it if you log out.\"Hearing BurningCloud's words, the players being battered around on the platform breathed a sigh of relief. The guild leader gave her a grateful nod and led the charge off the edge of the platform, throwing himself into the endless abyss. Just as he jumped, an enormous torrent of water burst from the platform, swirling into a massive whirlpool. The water swept the last player to make it to the edge back into the center of the platform where the hammering rain soon sent them out of the game. Falling from the platform, the other players waited until they stopped taking damage from the fragmenting raindrops and then tried to log out. Falling into the endless abyss should have allowed them to break out of combat and log out, but the players watching were horrified to see that they did not actually disappear.\"Oh no.\" BurningCloud quickly opened up her interface and selected the log out option.*ding* Catching sight of what was happening out of the corner of his eye, Thorn continued his painstaking climb. Testing each hand-hold carefully, Thorn pulled himself up and jammed his claws into the jar. On the third platform, Mina was keeping an eye on his large figure even as she and the Titan squad continued to battle the armadillo stone guardian. The Eastern Alliance had finally killed the stone guardian they were fighting, as had most of the other groups, and it wasn't long before a well-placed ice spike finished off the armadillo stone guardian.Gripping the side of the jar carefully, Thorn had no idea how strange the battle had become. With no one on the first platform to disrupt Courdum's spell casting, the boss fight settled into a bunch of teams watching from their various platforms as Thorn slowly climbed the side of the jar. Up on top of the jar, Courdum was in the middle of charging a light silver ball of energy on the top of his staff.\"What are we waiting for?\" On the seventh platform a mage pulled on the guild leader's sleeve. \"We need to go, otherwise we'll be next. That wind spell is coming for us, believe me.\"\"Go? What do you mean, go?\" The leader's face was white. \"Have you tried logging out? We're stuck here until the fight is over.\" Blanching, the mage tried to log out. With a dreadful sigh, his shoulders slumped. \"Sometimes I hate this game.\"\"Yeah, me too. It looks like it is either jump off or eat the next spell. It is a bummer, though. I kinda want to see what that huge dude is planning to do when he gets to the top of the platform.\"\"Isn't he a guild leader or something?\"\"Yeah, he runs Nova Luna. Thorn, I think.\"\"Well, unless he speeds up, I don't think we'll make it.\" The mage shrugged, throwing a glance at Courdum's glowing staff.Similar conversations were happening on each platform as the players watched Thorn crawl up the side of the jar. By this time he had made it up to the same level as the second platform and only had twenty-five feet left to go before the top of the jar. From his position he couldn't see the glow on the end of Courdum's staff, but judging by the resigned look on the faces of the players on the seventh platform, the next spell was about to go off.Gritting his teeth, Thorn tried to activate [Wolf's Rage], expecting the familiar burning in his chest, only to feel nothing. Confused, he flipped open his notifications and spotted a blinking status effect. Gritting his teeth, he lunged, his claws carving a deep furrow into the side of the jar as he propelled himself up. Quickly climbing the side of the jar, Thorn ignored the small part of his mind that was screaming about how bad of an idea this was. Within a few moments, the edge of the central platform was within reach, and Thorn's massive hand reached for it.Just as his fingers were about to grip the edge of the platform, his left hand suddenly ripped through the crumbing side of the jug, sending a blast of black mist that knocked him back into the air. With his body hanging over the abyss and the edge of the platform now just out of his reach, Thorn was about to plunge down when he felt something hard slap into his back. Slammed forward into the side of the jar, Thorn grabbed the edge of the platform and pulled himself up.With a groan, he rolled over, looking back at the large barbarian standing next to BurningCloud who had just thrown an axe at him. Flashing a somewhat strained smile, the beautiful guild leader gave him a wink and a thumbs up. Raising his hand weakly in thanks, Thorn rose to his feet, his eyes sweeping over Courdum just as the boss thrust his staff into the seventh symbol. \"Thorn! Stop!\"Just about to jump forward and attack, Thorn was pulled up short by Mina's yell. The players on the seventh platform had all jumped down to their deaths, abandoning the fight before the apocalyptic wind storm ripped through the air above their platform. Massive wind blades mixed with cyclones, carving deep fissures into the platform where they had just stood.\"Thorn, you can't attack.\" It was nearly impossible for Thorn to hear Mina's voice over the sound of the wind storm, so she opened up a direct channel.\"What do you mean? How else are we going to stop him?\"\"If you attack, you'll hit the threshold too fast, and he is going to teleport. Then what are we going to do? It is fine if he teleports to one of the platforms with a team on it, but most of the teams are nearly dead anyway, and three of them are empty. If he leaves that platform, we are hosed.\"\"Are you kidding? I climbed up here for nothing?\" His eyes fixed on Courdum, Thorn had to forcefully restrain himself from rushing toward the ancient Dwarven king.\"No, there has to be a way, I just need to think.\" Mina bit the end of her finger in frustration. \"We never should have left Velin behind!\"\"Yeah, she would be a big help right about now.\" Thorn struggled to keep himself in check, his fingers squeezing into tight fists.\"Um. I have an idea.\" \"Hm?\" Hearing a voice from Mina's side of the call, Thorn was surprised to see Delmore's striped face appear in the chat. \"No way, that is crazy.\" After listening to the Tigerkin's idea Thorn shook his head.\"Come on, Thorn. This will work. We got this.\" Mina's face lit up. \"Trust us.\"A few seconds later a wide grin broke across Thorn's face and he nodded resolutely.\"Let's do it.\"On the third platform a flurry of activity broke out as the Titan squad began to prepare. Thorn watched them for a second before he turned back toward Courdum the Stone King. Still floating in the air, the boss had completed his attack on the seventh platform and was beginning to charge his spell to attack the sixth. For a few breathless moments, Thorn stood as still as stone, watching the growing glow on the end of Courdum's staff.\"Mina, are you ready yet?\"\"Just hang on a moment. This would be a lot easier if you were down here.\"\"Sure, but this spell is about to go off.\"\"Done! We're ready to go. Alright, let's do this thing,\" Mina's out of breath voice came over the channel. With one last glance at the rapidly filling heart symbol in the center of the platform, Thorn took a deep breath and stepped backward off of the platform.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

The endless black expanse stretched below him, rapidly engulfing his vision. Flipping onto his back, he pulled a dagger out of his inventory and launched it up into the air, aiming for the roof of the cavern. Turning back over, he saw BurningCloud's beautiful face flash by, her mouth hanging open in shock as he dropped. Within a split second, Thorn had rushed by the second platform and was rapidly approaching the third platform where the Titan squad stood behind a massive chunk of rock. They had rolled the stone corpse of the armadillo guardian over to the edge of the platform and balanced it carefully on the edge, waiting for Thorn to pass by in his freefall. Watching Thorn come flying down, Mina calculated carefully.\"Now!\" With her yell, twenty members of the Titan squad who were standing behind the huge stone, heaved, tipping it over the edge. At the same moment, the support players standing nearby threw every buffing spell they had at Thorn, causing him to light up like a beacon.Thorn had turned his body flat, spreading his arms out as he fell. Just as the body of the stone guardian tipped over, he grabbed it, pulling it the rest of the way off of the platform. Gripping the stone plates of the armadillo guardian's back armor, arcane energy and holy light from the buffs streaming off of him, Thorn plunged toward the darkness.On the central platform, Courdum the Stone King had already charged his staff again and summoned a void storm over the sixth platform. Jagged cracks appeared in the air, sucking in the dust and stone that broke from the platform. One particularly long crack lanced through the air, catching the foot of the corpse of the stone guardian the players had defeated. With a snapping sound the stone statue's entire leg broke into pieces and the shards shot into the crack, disappearing into the void in an instant.Gulping, the players who remained on the other platforms turned their eyes away from the devastation caused by the void storm spell and looked at Thorn's figure plummeting rapidly down into the endless pit below them.\"What on earth is he doing?\"\"I... I don't know.\" BurningCloud shook her head and shrugged. \"In any case, we are all dead, so it doesn't particularly matter. I mean, jumping off is probably a better way to go than getting caught up in one of these spells.\"\"Fair point.\"\"Delmore!\" Watching Thorn's figure disappear with the corpse of the armadillo stone guardian held above his head, Mina suddenly panicked.\"Chill.\" His face as inscrutable as ever, the Tigerkin Spirit Guide thrust his long handled dagger forward and began to spin the blade. Cutting through the air, the purplish-black lines emerged wherever his dagger passed.  Once the symbol solidified, he spun and thrust his dagger forward again. \"[Greater Spirit Transfer]!\"The purplish-black spell symbol blinked, appearing over the void as it began to grow. Pulsing, a smaller copy of the symbol appeared underneath Thorn as he fell. The purple tentacles shot out of the symbol to wrap around him, but he was traveling so fast that he crushed through them, splattering himself with blackish ichor. \"[Spirit Swap]!\"On the third platform Delmore gulped as the spell encountered the weight of the Titan and his massive stone burden. His whiskers trembling, Delmore flicked his dagger around. The strange layered voices poured from his mouth as he gestured toward a spirit he had summoned earlier. With a flash of light, the spirit disappeared, the dagger that Thorn had thrown toward the roof of the cavern appearing in its place. Not wasting a moment, Delmore flicked the point of his dagger again, and the large purple symbol hanging over the endless abyss pulsed. Next to the ceiling of the cavern, the spirit that Delmore had transferred with the dagger was about to plummet back down toward the platforms. Shivering, it opened its mouth in a silent roar, and with a warping sound, the purple symbol from the [Greater Spirit Transfer] flashed into existence in front of it.Falling into the symbol with a squelching sound, Thorn and the body of the armadillo stone guardian disappeared, only to reappear up at the ceiling, ripping their way through the hanging purple symbol. Already traveling near terminal velocity when they hit the spell symbol, Thorn was barely slowed at all and began to freefall at a tremendous rate.Plummeting toward Courdum, the armadillo stone guardian held over his head like a meteor, Thorn only had time for one breath before he was nearly on top of the Stone King. [Wolf's Rage] activated, and Thorn poured all of his prodigious strength into swinging the massive chunk of stone in his hands down onto the central platform.\"Get bubbles on him!\" Mina screamed, her heart hammering. Around her, the support players whose spells could reach Thorn cast their invulnerability shield spells, wreathing him in numerous arcane energies.Courdum had finished his void spell and was muttering an incantation as he pointed at the black heart symbol that was almost completely filled with mist. Sensing that something was not right, he looked up, his stone eyes widening with surprise as the corpse of the stone guardian filled his vision. *BOOOOOM*The wave of sound echoed, the sound coming first and the force generated by the strike hitting them a moment later. Mina was afraid that the platform they stood on was going to crumble. The impact was so loud that its sound waves threatened to rip apart the very stone under their feet. Many of the players were forced backward, a few unlucky ones even tumbling from the platforms.\"[Ice Wall]!\" Summoning a glistening wall of ice, Mina huddled behind it as the ripples of sound battered against the other side. Beside her, Delmore crouched down, the hand that was gripping his long-handled knife trembling as he got ready to throw up a defensive spell as soon as the [Ice Wall] went down. *CRACK*Following directly on the heels of the shockwave, an even louder cracking sound echoed through the cavern. Feeling the trembling subside, Mina peeked her head out from around the side of the [Ice Wall] only to dive backward as a blast of black mist shot toward her face. The thick black mist roiled madly as it burst from a massive crack in the jar. As soon as the mist rolled around the wall, Delmore gasped, looking in horror at his dagger. Previously covered in a purple glow, the blade had dimmed down to a slight sheen.\"My skills are locked!\" Delmore shouted, his voice barely making a sound. Panicking, he pushed at Mina who had not heard him despite being only a few feet away. Scrambling over until he was right next to her, Delmore shouted again. \"The mist is blocking my skills!\"\"What?\" Quickly trying to cast an [Ice Spike], Mina felt a choking sensation in her chest as the mana she had gathered was sucked away by the heavy black mist. \"Oh no. Oh, no.\" Opening up her chat window Mina tried to call Thorn, only to realize that her messaging options were greyed out. As the cloud of crushed stone and black mist cleared from the top of the central platform, Thorn's sprawled figure was revealed. His armor in pieces, he lay bleeding in a crater near the shattered remains of the golden throne. Coughing violently, he staggered to his feet, swaying like a drunk as he looked around. Still in an enraged state, his body froze when he saw Courdum the Stone King crawling out of the pit he had been smashed into. The armadillo stone guardian was no more, the only remnant a piece of scale gripped in Thorn's claws. Tossing the shard of stone to the side, Thorn staggered forward. The weight of the stone guardian had blasted apart Courdum's defenses, driving him into the stone platform, but apart from some cracks in his robes, the ancient Dwarven king was still standing.\"[Wolf Lord's Howl]!\" Throwing back his head, Thorn's voice failed to come out but he was so disoriented he did not realize that his skill had failed as he leapt forward. Taking advantage of the boss's lack of motion, Thorn reached out with his left hand, closing his claws around Courdum's shoulder. Drawing back his right hand, Thorn balled his fist and let loose with the hardest punch he had ever thrown. *SNAP*As the newest sound rang out, Mina jumped slightly, hunkering down again in preparation for whatever was coming. When nothing happened, her head popped out of cover once again. On the top of the platform, Thorn stood frozen, a headless body in his hand as he watched Courdum's head roll along the uneven ground. With a gentle tink, Courdum's crown slipped from his head, rolling to a stop at the foot of the remains of the golden throne where it leaned crookedly.*ding* With a massive sigh, Thorn slumped down to his knees, Courdum's body falling from his hand. As soon as it touched the ground, thousands of tiny cracks spidered across, and it shattered into a million pieces. Staring at the cracked head that was half facing him, Thorn realized that his first blow had done significantly more damage than he realized, sending countless cracks through Courdum's body. The Stone King had kept his body together, but only barely, and Thorn's last punch had been too much.Down below, Mina looked around wildly. The cloud of mist that covered the platforms was still being drawn up toward the top of the jar where the heart symbol had nearly filled. The updraft pulled the mist from the lower platforms and a crazy thought flashed in Mina's head. Starting to run toward the edge of the platform, she felt a thick hand grab her arm and turned her head.Jorge flashed past her, his short legs a blur as he took her place. Turning his head, he gave her a wide grin and a wink, gesturing that he would do it. Without waiting for a response, the Shadow Assassin launched himself from the edge of the platform, falling down and out of the mist. As soon as he had cleared the bottom edge of the mist, Jorge turned into a puff of smoke, appearing on the sixth platform.Just as he appeared a crackling void tear materialized, cutting straight through the air toward his neck. Cursing, he tumbled backward to try and avoid losing his head. Hitting the ground on his back, Jorge pushed off with his legs, throwing himself into a back handspring. Another void crack ripped through the ground he had just occupied. Reaching up, his hand came away from his face bloody.A faint sound intruded on Thorn's thoughts, and he looked up, trying to figure out where it was coming from. The impact had left his ears ringing, and it took him a moment to focus on it. After a moment, he realized the sound was coming from his messaging system. Bemused, he rolled over to take a look. Opening up the call, he saw Jorge who was bleeding from numerous cuts all over his body. Despite a rather significant cut on his face, the Shadow Assassin was yelling something.Still slightly out of it, Thorn waved back, but quickly realized that the look on Jorge's face was not a happy one. Frowning, Thorn shook his head to try and clear the fog and concentrated. \"Thorn, the heart!\"The words filtered in through Thorn's ears, causing his brow to furrow as he tried to make sense of them.\"The heart! The stone spell! The black mist locks all our abilities!\" Jorge tried to dodge another void tear as he yelled but was unable to get out of the way fast enough. Crumpling to the ground, he cursed, rolling over and over as he lost the use of his right leg.Thorn's head snapped around, his widening eyes locking onto the floating heart symbol that was still sucking up the heavy black mist. Even though Courdum the Stone King had been beaten, the spell that he had started was still active. Around the almost completely darkened symbol floated the ten symbols that represented the various platforms, five of them burned out from Courdum's apocalyptic spells.Sylith's words flashed through his head as he examined the heart symbol. According to what the Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight had said, after the fifth spell that Courdum cast, the next one would be a petrification spell. Up until now, the Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight's abandonment of the fight had made no sense, but now the pieces were starting to fall into place. The black mist was what Courdum used to create his immortal stone army, and Thorn had no doubt that the petrification spell was part of that process. If the black mist also locked a player's abilities, it was highly likely that the petrification spell would, as well, and given the way Sylith worked, it was probably permanent. His mind working furiously, Thorn tried to stand up, only to find the power gone from his limbs.Even his immense endurance could not stand up to the damage he had taken after falling from the sky. Only the stacked spells from the Titan squad had kept him alive, but the last of his strength had been spent on his final punch. Gritting his teeth, Thorn took a deep breath and forced himself up onto one knee. Pausing, he gasped for breath, a tearing pain in ribs reminding him what a terrible state he was in.\"Thorn, the spell is about to go off!\" Desperate, Mina tried to call out, but the choking black mist stilled the words in her throat. Trying to find a support player who could cast a spell, her heart plummeted as she was met with nothing but helpless shrugs.Up on the central platform, Thorn's ragged breath caught as he got his second knee under him. Pulling the massive warhammer out of his inventory, Thorn let the heavy end fall to the ground in front of him. The hammer bounced, nearly causing him to lose his grip on it. Taking another stabbing breath, he gripped the end as tightly as he could and heaved with every once of his remaining strength. Slowly he pushed himself upward. First one foot, then the other, settled on the uneven stone as he dragged himself to his feet.Keeping his eyes fixed on the heart symbol, Thorn saw the last remaining empty portion fill up with black mist. The symbol blinked with an evil light and then suddenly spun, transforming before his eyes into a glistening black stone heart with thin pulsing green veins. Knowing that he was too late, Thorn instinctively fell forward, his arm reaching out and his massive hand closing over the stone heart. Seeing the black and green light glowing stronger and stronger through his fingers, Thorn panicked. Shoving the heart in his mouth, he swallowed.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone! Are you interested in reading the rest of Book #3 and all of Book #4?

After an indeterminable amount of time, Thorn found himself lying on his back in the white in-between world. His senses were still hazy, but he caught snippets of conversation as he faded in and out. Myst's voice, normally upbeat, came across laden with worry,  but before Thorn could open his mouth to reassure her, he heard a deep, warm voice answering. Hati's tone enveloped his mind, bringing with it comfort and a measure of clarity.Unfortunately, the clarity slipped away again as Hati stopped speaking, and Thorn was unable to catch the next words. He had never heard the speaker's voice before, but based on Hati's silence, he assumed they were pretty important. Once again his world faded into darkness and Thorn fell unconscious.With a start, his eyes abruptly snapped open. Sitting up, it took him a moment to realize that he was on his bed in Fantasia. Around him, the comfortable environment practiced its influence on his mind, causing him to calm down rapidly. Taking a deep breath, Thorn flopped back onto the bed and stared up at the ceiling as his thoughts whirred over the events of the fight.What on earth had possessed him to eat the stone heart, Thorn had no idea, but his last memory was shoving it into his mouth and swallowing it down. The stone heart slid down his throat like it belonged in his stomach, but he had fallen unconscious almost immediately and had no idea how the rest of the fight had turned out. Sighing, Thorn opened his mouth.\"---.\"Startled, Thorn closed his lips. The words felt like they were coming out of his mouth, but he had not heard a sound. Coughing, Thorn grabbed a glass from his nightstand and filled it with water in the bathroom, gulping it down. Opening his mouth he tried again.\"---.\"A feeling of helplessness washing over him, Thorn sat down on the toilet seat, staring blankly at himself in the mirror. It was a full minute before he was able to focus his mind, and after a moment, he repeated the command in his mind.'Status.' Every single one of his abilities was greyed out, appearing to have been turned to stone. The black mist had locked the abilities of anyone who was caught in it, and Thorn could only assume that swallowing the stone heart had the same effect. After all, it was made of the black mist. Shaking his head, Thorn was about to go and find the others when he caught sight of something in the mirror.Standing, he looked closer. His skin had taken on a slightly greyish tone and under the surface were tiny green veins running the length of his body. As he examined himself in the mirror, Thorn realized his skin had taken on a marble-like hue. Another effect of the stone heart, no doubt. Returning to his bed and opening up his menu, Thorn began to scroll through the notifications he had missed after he swallowed the stone heart. The first popup that Thorn had missed was the announcement of the World Quest's completion. Swallowing the stone heart had prevented the spell from petrifying the remaining players and had ended the fight, though not before it took Thorn out of the game. Apart from some gold and the [Hero] title,  which granted him a slight increase in his reputation for having cleared a World Quest, killing Courdum had granted Thorn a few items.  When Thorn checked his [RMS], he saw that the [Rakkam City Access Token] effect had already been applied, marking Nova Luna as friendly with the Stone Dwarf faction. Looking over the [RMS], he was surprised to see a tab marked [Flamespire Fortress] that he had never seen before. Opening it, he poked around for a few moments and then dug into his notifications again, eventually coming across a jaw-dropping set of announcements. His mouth hanging open, it took Thorn a moment to gather his wits. The first two announcements were not that surprising, matching up with what Velin had told him when they started the World Quest. The third announcement, however, came as a huge surprise. He had intended to do what he could to wrestle control of the underground fortress away from Ragnarok, but the game had just done it for him. Resolving to ask Velin what had happened, he opened up his status again and examined the new titles he had earned.  Just as Thorn was about to open the new abilities granted by his [Bearer of the Stone Heart] title, the door to his room opened a crack, and his aunt poked her head in. Seeing that he was awake, she opened the door fully. Velin, Mina, Jorge, Corvo, Oberlin, and Baxby followed Athena into the room. Feeling slightly awkward from the intense stares being leveled at him, Thorn smiled weakly and waved.\"How are you feeling, bud?\" Athena sat down next to him, taking his massive hand in hers. \"You've been out for a couple of days, but Eve said you were going to be fine.\"Opening his mouth, Thorn remembered that he could no longer speak and his shoulders slumped. Mina, assuming that he was feeling bad, patted him on the shoulder. \"Hey, don't sweat it. You did great. That crazy attack killed the boss, and we beat the dungeon! We got some really nice rewards, too. Everyone got gear and tokens. Some people even got a master level token, which is nuts. It was scary for a moment, but you really pulled us through.\"\"Scary doesn't cover the half of it.\" Jorge shuddered, remembering the void tears on the sixth platform.\"You did great, too.\" Mina flashed a smile at the Dwarf. His willingness to risk himself for her had made her really happy.Athena, who was watching Thorn carefully, saw that he was still looking a bit off, so after a few minutes she herded everyone out of the room, leaving Velin and Thorn facing each other. Just as Corvo was about to exit, Velin called him back.\"Can you wait a second, Corvo?\"\"Hm? Oh, yeah. Sure.\" Walking back over, Corvo flopped down in one of Thorn's extra large chairs. Taking the seat next to him, Velin looked at Thorn seriously.\"Thorn, what is wrong?\"\"---.\" Opening his mouth and speaking with no sound, Thorn pointed to his mouth. Unable to hear anything, Velin frowned and Corvo leaned forward, his eyes narrowing.\"Mina said that you grabbed the stone heart, which disrupted the spell?\"Nodding, Thorn pantomimed eating it and swallowing. At first, Velin did not understand what he was trying to communicate, but once Corvo erupted into laughter it dawned on her what Thorn meant and her eyes widened.\"You ate it?!\"\"Hahaha.\" Corvo nearly fell from his chair as he laughed.Thorn rubbed his nose and glanced at his fellow avatar in annoyance. Catching Velin's incredulous look, his expression morphed into sheepishness. Shrugging, he began to share his notification windows, allowing both Corvo and Velin to catch up on what was going on with him.\"Wow. That is crazy. I've seen a lot of things, but this is entirely new.\" Corvo leaned back in his chair, a speculative look on his face. \"I've seen quests that give some pretty serious disadvantages until you can clear them, but I have never seen anything this bad. No talking? Sheesh. Well, that's what you get for eating a cursed stone heart.\" It was obvious that Corvo felt no sympathy. \"I mean, it was the central target of a World Quest. What on earth made you think that you could eat it? You know what, nevermind. I don't want to know.\"\"Hey, cut it out. Thorn saved everyone. If he hadn't eaten the heart, the whole Titan squad would be cursed.\" Velin glared at Corvo.\"Haha, I know, it is just really funny.\" The avatar held up his hands in surrender.\"Quiet, you are not helping. Thorn, you did a great job with this quest. There is no way we would have won without you. Even eating the stone heart. It certainly was effective, though I don't know that I'd recommend it as a normal strategy. Now we just need to solve this curse. Tell me, can you use your messaging application?\"Shaking his head, Thorn gestured to Velin, made the calling hand gesture, and pointed to himself.\"We can call you? Interesting. Let's try that.\" Picking up on what Thorn was trying to get across, Corvo called Thorn through the messaging application.Hearing the ring, Thorn answered the message, but was still unable to talk. After a few more tests, it was determined that Thorn could still get messages but was unable to respond to them in any way. The only option that Thorn could think of was to get a pen and paper and write out his questions and answers.Holding up the piece of paper he had just written on, Thorn looked questioningly at Velin.\"What happened? Oh, you mean after the fight?\" Velin straightened up and cleared her throat. Corvo looked at Thorn and rolled his eyes, earning himself a dirty look. \"To get the full picture, we need to go back to the first fight that Ragnarok had with Courdum. From our sources, we learned that Sylith was not actually part of the group that entered the first time. Instead, it was Raeth who led the initial group.\"We should have expected this, as it is standard practice for Ragnarok to send a scouting party into every boss fight. They do this so they can get a sense for the fight and sniff out any surprises. Anyway, they had to fight all nine of the Stone Guardians by themselves which killed most of them. Raeth fell in the second phase, which is why he wasn't part of the group that Sylith led, and only three Silver Guard were still alive when the stone heart spell went off. \"When they came out of the fight, they had the same curse that you do. All abilities locked. Though, they can still talk.\" Velin shot Thorn a glance. \"Presumably because they did not eat the stone heart. Regardless, Sylith must have figured out that they could avoid the fight if they waited for the platforms to fill up. We're still not entirely sure how they avoided getting dragged into the fight, but they were able to log out after it started.\"His eyes lighting up, Thorn remembered the silver flash he had seen falling from the central platform. Now that Velin was mentioning it the pieces fell into place. Using his fingers to try and illustrate what had happened, he soon got frustrated and just wrote out a brief description. \"Ragnarok only sent one member of their team forward to start the fight,\" he wrote, \"keeping everyone else out of combat. Then, before Courdum the Stone King could make it onto their platform, that player jumped off the platform to his death. This kept everyone else out of combat until the third phase started and Courdum started to cast, allowing them to log out.\"\"What a nasty plan.\" Corvo grimaced. \"Honestly, though, this is already the best possible outcome. If you had not, uh, disposed of the stone heart, the whole Titan squad would be cursed. Along with the teams from Eastern Alliance, Mirage, and the Tower of Immortals. Can you imagine that? Four of the best teams from top guilds suddenly becoming next to useless because their abilities are completely locked? Ragnarok would have gained a huge advantage. Especially since they could come in and actually try to beat the quest once you all died. Nasty.\"\"Thankfully, you did something about it.\" Velin allowed a small smile to curl the edges of her lips as she thought about it. \"Think about how upset Sylith must be right now. On top of losing the rewards from the quest, Ragnarok has been blacklisted by Eastern Alliance and some of the other top guilds. They probably have a war on their hands.\"There was no doubt that the Heavenly Silver Dragon Knight must be livid. Things had really seemed to be going his way only for his plan to be thwarted at the last pass. Thorn could not deny that he was happy to have finally gotten one over on the leader of Ragnarok. Scribbling another question, he looked at Velin curiously.\"That is the best part. So, you know how the announcement for the Stone Dwarves said that they dislike outsiders? Well, it turns out that is not even close. They are really distrustful. As soon as Courdum died and you ate the heart, we got a bunch of notifications announcing all of these changes. One of them was that the Dwarves were turning over the fortresses to the guilds who were part of the final boss fight.\"Since Ragnarok left before the fight, they currently have zero reputation with the Stone Dwarves, and were kicked out of the fortress. We were the only other guild who made it through the forge district, and we are considered friendly thanks to you dropping a rock on Courdum's head, so they gave the fortress to us. They don't want to have to deal with outsiders, so they are leaving that to us.\" \"Sylith is in major trouble.\" Corvo could not help but jump in. \"He not only lost the World Quest, but he lost the fortress as well. This means that Ragnarok has no base in the Deepworld and that every member of their guild has to grind their own reputation up to friendly before the Stone Dwarves will give them the time of day. Add to that the guild war that will probably erupt soon, and Ragnarok is in a really rough place.\"Grinning, Thorn nodded. Things really could not have turned out better. Still, reality quickly pulled him back to the ground. No matter how happy he was that Sylith had lost this round, he was still stuck with no voice and no abilities.Corvo, ever observant, caught the change in his expression and brought the conversation back around.\"So, you don't have access to any of your abilities? Nothing? No passives or anything?\"Thorn nodded. While his titles seemed to still be active, anything that was deemed an ability was completely locked down.\"Whew, that is an annoying curse. And it locks down your ability to communicate. Crazy. You might want to find a way to break that soon.\"Her eyes flickering, Velin pulled out her notebook and began to flip through the pages. Finding the spot she was looking for, she flipped the book around and pointed to a drawing of a large tree. Underneath it were copious notes, and the more Thorn read, the higher his eyebrows rose. Finishing the page, Thorn looked up to meet Velin's golden eyes. For the first time in a while, Thorn saw a full blown smile spread across her face as she spoke.\"I have a plan.\"B3 End-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

That is what came to mind when Thorn looked in the mirror. The Rakkam smiths had crafted an entire Wolfkin out of a mixture of Fire Iron and Darksteel, creating a bronze-colored behemoth for Thorn to wear. From the tips of the clawed boots to the tips of the helmet's ears, the suit covered every inch of Thorn's massive body in thick metal.Flexing the clawed fingers of his gauntlets, Thorn rotated his hands, admiring the thick carvings that covered every inch of the armor plates. The Stone Dwarves were truly masters of their craft, and despite the size and weight of the heavy armor set, Thorn did not feel constricted in the least. Stretching his shoulders, Thorn opened up the armor's stats. Turning to the dwarven blacksmiths who were watching him put on the armor, Thorn gave them a thumbs up. Unlike the other armor he had seen, this armor was created as a set and could only be worn as a total unit, preventing him from being able to add or remove pieces. On the plus side, that meant that it gained all the bonuses of a full set without needing to be collected piece by piece. \"Looks good.\" Corvo examined the bronze-colored armor. Used to seeing Thorn in shining silver armor, the Wolfkin-themed bronze armor lent the Titan a fierce air.\"It better look good; it cost a fortune,\" Mina said, poking one of the hard metal studs along the spine of Thorn's armor. \"A small price to pay for helping us beat the World Quest.\" Looking over his shoulder, Thorn saw the beautiful guild leader of the Eastern Alliance standing next to Velin. BurningCloud had messaged Thorn two days after the fight against Courdum the Stone King inviting him to meet her in Rakkam. Once there, she presented him with enough master level [Dwarven Gear Tokens] to commission a complete set of armor from the master blacksmiths.The [Wolf Lord's Heavy Armor] was the result, a fearsome set that included offensive, defensive, and movement abilities as part of its traits. The three abilities of the armor came at a welcome time as Thorn's other abilities were completely locked down thanks to the [Living Statue] curse he had picked up from swallowing the corrupted [Stone Heart] in the fight with Courdum. Turning his attention back to his armor, Thorn pulled up his status with a mental command. The number of titles and abilities listed was enough to make anyone green with envy, but Thorn could only shake his head, despondent. The [Living Statue] curse not only locked his abilities, but it also removed his ability to communicate with others. No speaking, no sending messages through his in-game messaging system, no initiating video calls. The best Thorn could do was write messages on paper and hand them out. \"Thank you for your gift. It was very generous of you.\" Next to BurningCloud, Velin tucked her hair behind her ear and took a slight step forward, positioning herself neatly between BurningCloud and Thorn. \"Nova Luna appreciates it.\"\"Of course. It is the least we can do.\" Giving the Elf a sweet smile, BurningCloud turned her attention back toward Thorn, who was still looking at his status. When the Titan did not look up, she gave a small cough to get his attention. Looking up, Thorn saw the two ladies staring at him. Similar in height and in attractiveness, the auras they exuded could not have been more different. BurningCloud was the definition of a fiery beauty, her red phoenix armor giving off a mature charm. Velin, on the other hand, was almost ethereal. No less beautiful, she exuded a glacial calm. Feeling a bead of sweat run down his back at the two gazes fixed on him, Thorn gave them another thumbs up and grabbed Corvo by the arm, pulling him out of the room.Behind him, BurningCloud sniffed, annoyance flashing through her eyes. Velin, on the other hand, seemed oddly pleased and immediately engaged the pretty guild leader in small talk, preventing her from following Thorn. Mina and Jorge, watching all this from the side, glanced at each other and then back at the two beautiful ladies. Almost as one, they swallowed and then fled the room. Once he was outside, Thorn let go of Corvo's arm and breathed a sigh of relief. Seeing that they were in an open space, Thorn gestured toward his fellow avatar's chest and then pointed at himself, punching his fist into his palm. The avatar of the All-Seeing Raven shook his head resolutely as he backed up.\"Absolutely not!\" Corvo shook his head vehemently. \"Find someone else if you want to beat up on them. I have no desire to get my head kicked in just so you can test your new armor. Ah! Jorge, come here. Mina, you too.\"Grasping his opportunity, the avatar dragged Mina and Jorge in between him and Thorn. Patting them on their shoulders, he smiled and pointed at them.\"These two are really good fighters, so you can test yourself against them.\"Slowly lifting his hand, Thorn held out three fingers, and then, before Corvo could respond, he rushed forward to attack.\"What? You want to fight all three of us? How insulting!\" Pretending to be angry, Mina pointed her wand at Thorn. Her voice quivered in amusement as she summoned her three ice orbs to float around her head. At the same moment, she slid sideways, pushing off of Jorge who tumbled away, vanishing as he went. With Mina and Jorge vanishing from in front of him, Corvo was left in the charging Titan's path.\"Oh, come on,\" the Elf grumbled, jumping backward nimbly. Grinning under his helmet, Thorn shot a glance at Mina who was still sliding to his right. The Ice Witch was moving too quickly for him to intercept her and a quick look to his left showed Jorge was nowhere to be seen. Fixing his eyes back on Corvo, Thorn lifted his fist and let loose a punch, straight toward the Elf's face. With another sigh, the thin figure in front of Thorn flicked his fingers, catching a rapier as it dropped out of the air.Just as Thorn's fist was about to reach him Corvo floated sideways, his ragged coat shimmering. Almost fading from Thorn's sight, the tip of his sword drew a small circle around the incoming attack. Slightly mesmerized by the strange movement of Corvo's coat, it wasn't until it was too late that Thorn realized his punch had been drawn off course, smashing into the ground. At the same moment, he felt the point of the rapier scratch along the armor around his throat, deflecting away. Seeing his attack fail, Corvo cursed under his breath and sprang away, his coat transforming into a pair of wings as he moved. Impressed by his new armor, Thorn turned to the others, only to find the courtyard completely empty. Both Mina and Jorge had run away, totally abandoning the fight. Above him, Corvo had completed his transformation into a bird and was glaring at the Titan from a small perch near the ceiling.With Mina and Jorge gone and Corvo refusing to come down, all Thorn could do was sigh and shrug. He briefly considered going back to find Velin but the memory of the Elf standing next to BurningCloud made him sweat. Deciding that he wanted no part of whatever was going on there, Thorn was about to escape as well when he heard a gruff voice from near his knee. \"So? Whatcha think?\"Barely coming up to his thigh, Master Smith Varroh was as wide as he was tall. Having seen the Master Smith wield a hammer in each hand as he crushed metal into submission, Thorn knew he would be no fun to face in a fight. Opening his mouth, Thorn could only close it again in frustration. Not being able to speak was turning out to be a serious drag. Instead, he had to make do with giving Master Smith a thumbs up.\"Oh, that's right. You're mute. Sorry, forgot about that.\" Tapping his pipe reflexively, Varroh narrowed his eyes as he considered something. \"Hey, you want to test your armor out? I know a good spot where you can get a good workout.\"Perking up, Thorn nodded. Fighting was quickly becoming one of his favorite parts of the game but none of his friends seemed to want to give it a go. Not that he could blame them. At eight feet, nine inches tall, Thorn had both strength and reach on all of them. Add nearly limitless endurance and then wrap metal around it and you had a walking tank. Not the most fun duel for anyone.\"Alright. Come along. I'll take you over.\" Spinning on his heels, Master Smith Varroh led Thorn out of the smithy's yard. The Master Smith was chatty in a slow and steady way and introduced Thorn to all of the different blacksmith shops as they walked through the forge district of Rakkam. As it turned out, all of the smiths were connected to him in some way, with most being the apprentices of smiths that had been his apprentices. Thorn could tell that Varroh was quite proud of this and did his best to show interest, though that proved difficult with his wolf head helmet on.Back at Varroh's smithy, Velin and BurningCloud walked out into the shop's yard and looked around. Not seeing anyone, BurningCloud finally said goodbye and left. Watching her go, Velin's face resumed its normal coldness, the warm smile she had shown BurningCloud nowhere to be seen. \"You need to do something about that kid.\" Corvo's annoyed voice floated down from where he was perched in his bird form. Watching him jump off his perch, his wide black wings spreading as he glided down, Velin raised an eyebrow.\"Did he try to fight you again?\" \"Yeah, Mina and Jorge both ran away, leaving me alone.\"\"Where is he now?\" Velin gave a slight smile. This same drama had been playing over and over ever since Thorn had lost his voice after the fight against Courdum the Stone King.\"He wandered off with Varroh, the Master Smith. Probably looking for a place to test his armor.\"\"Good. Hopefully he can blow off a little steam. I think he is just frustrated and fighting is the only way he knows how to express that.\"\"Sure, I get it. But he doesn't have to express it on me, does he?\"\"You're fine. More importantly,\" Velin flipped open her notebook, her finger running down a list she had written. \"How are you doing with that transportation?\"\"I contacted my friend, but Thorn's weight is going to be a real problem. Are you sure that getting to Rasyn will help with this curse? I had to call in a lot of favors for this.\"Instead of replying, Velin pulled a vial from her inventory and held it in front of Corvo's beak. His eyes going wide, his form blurred and he turned back into his Elven form, taking the vial from her hand.\"The sap of the world tree?\" Almost choking on the words as he said them, it was obvious that Corvo could hardly believe it.\"It is only a drop, but yes. If anything can clear Thorn's [Living Statue] curse, the sap of the world tree can. I've tracked the world tree to Rasyn. Once we get there, we can find the tree and the sap, completing a quest for me and clearing Thorn's curse.\"\"Do you think it will be as simple as just getting there and searching for it? No one else has found the world tree. At least, that we know of.\"\"I know, but a long shot is better than no shot at all.\" Velin sighed and rubbed her forehead. \"We only have three weeks until Thorn is supposed to be in the capital for his hearing, so whatever we do, it has to be fast.\"\"Alright. Well, I put out the call, so hopefully, we can make something happen. I'll let you know as soon as I do.\"\"Thanks, Corvo.\" Snapping her notebook shut, Velin took back the vial of sap from the world tree and put it away carefully. \"I've got to track Thorn down. Who knows where he wandered.\"\"That's true. He could be getting up to all sorts of trouble with the dwarven ladies.\" Chuckling, Corvo turned back into a large raven, wheeling above Velin's head. \"Can't be letting other ladies get their claws into him, can we? He is young and impressionable, after all.\"Ignoring the teasing, Velin just rolled her eyes and set off to find the Titan.\u00a0------------------------------------------------Hi everyone!

Eventually arriving at a large ramp, he brought Thorn onto a platform halfway down the side of a giant pit. The ramp continued to the left, angling along the pit wall until it reached the bottom of the pit, nearly three hundred feet down. Heavy duty rails ran down the length of the ramp, and a massive pulley system dragged metal cars up to the pit floor.\"See those big guys down there?\" The Master Smith pointed down at the bottom of the pit where some creatures waddled around. With his better than average eyesight, Thorn could see that they were scaled and each had six limbs extending from their circular torso. From this height they looked like small water bugs skating around the surface of a pond. Clicking accept, Thorn gave Varroh a thumbs up and began to walk down the ramp. As he walked, he examined the bugs on the pit floor. At first they appeared quite small, but the closer to the bottom of the ramp he got, the larger the metal crawlers became. When he hit the halfway point, the metal crawlers were about half his size. By the time he was three quarters of the way from the pit floor, they had grown to as tall as his height.Taking a deep breath, Thorn stepped off of the ramp onto the hard packed dirt floor and stared up at the nearest metal crawler. Despite appearing to be the size of bugs from the platform where Master Smith Varroh was watching with interest, the metal crawlers were a good one and a half times Thorn's height. Taking a deep breath and stretching out his shoulders, Thorn fixed his attention on the nearest one and took a step forward.Instantly, the nearest two metal crawlers rotated their bodies, their thick scaled legs punching into the ground like pistons as they turned to face Thorn. A large vertical slit that looked like it combined the function of their eyes, nose, and mouth flared, revealing saw-edged teeth. Letting out a jagged screech, both began to furiously charge toward Thorn. Their legs pounded the ground as they advanced, each step leaving a small crater in the dirt.With another deep breath, Thorn prepared to meet the two incoming metal crawlers. Activating his new claws, he was once again grateful that they were part of his new armor set instead of being an ability. Over the last few days he had really been missing his abilities, so the fact that he could use his claws despite the [Living Statue] curse was nice. Rather than move forward to meet the two incoming enemies, Thorn dropped into a slight crouch and lifted his hands into a standard defensive stance.The two metal crawlers jostled against each other as they charged toward Thorn, trying to be the first to get to him. The one on the left was slightly smaller and appeared to be on the losing end of the struggle but just as the two metal crawlers got within twenty feet of Thorn, it swept one of its pole-like legs out sideways, managing to trip the larger metal crawler. Hissing in triumph, it continued its thundering charge toward Thorn. The creature's maw yawned wide as it got closer.Watching the metal crawler carefully, Thorn was ready for its attack when it suddenly swerved. Using the same move it had just successfully employed against its brethren, it swept one of its legs out like a club. Taking a quick step back, Thorn reached out his hand and caught the leg as it came toward him, stopping it dead in the air. Tightening his grip, the claws on his gauntlet gleamed silver and punctured through the metal crawler's scales. Ignoring the creature's thrashing, Thorn punched his other hand forward, breaking the leg clean off as the metal crawler stumbled backward. Stepping forward, Thorn reversed the leg in his hand and stabbed it through the metal crawler's open mouth, skewering the creature through. Jumping over the dying metal crawler, Thorn charged toward the other metal crawler, which was getting back to its feet. Its gnashing teeth gave off the loud screech of metal grinding together. The metal crawler reared back on its two back legs as Thorn approached, its front legs waving in the air. When he was six feet away, Thorn leapt up in the air, batting the two metal pole arms away and coming down in the middle of the metal crawler's back. The force from his descent drove its body back down into the ground. Slashing down with his claws, Thorn abruptly cut off the creature's chittering cries.Watching from the platform on the ramp, Master Smith Varroh's eyebrows rose. He had brought Thorn to the quarry to see how the armor held up against the metal crawlers attacks but Thorn was shredding them like they were paper.\"Pretty impressive, huh?\"Hearing a silvery voice, Varroh turned his head as Velin came down the ramp. Nodding curtly, he turned back to look down at the Titan raging below.\"What else would one expect from the Kingbreaker? A hero who can defeat the Stone King shouldn't have any trouble with a paltry metal crawler nest.\"\"True.\" Glancing at the dwarf out of the corner of her eye, Velin stood beside him. The Stone Dwarves were naturally distant, but they seemed especially distrustful of Elves. Both Velin and Corvo had barely been able to get more than a few words from them. On the other hand, they had taken to Thorn like moths to a flame despite the fact that he could not speak. It was such a stark difference that Velin wondered if there was something else going on besides the fact that Thorn had dealt the finishing blow to Courdum the Stone King.\"I was admiring the runic work that you did on Lord Greymane's armor.\" Undeterred by Master Smith Varroh's standoffishness, Velin continued talking to him. \"I noticed similar rune sets on the Aether Gate that you were kind enough to install in Flamespire Fortress. Did you create those, as well? Pretty astounding work for how quickly you completed it.\"Hmp. Thanks.\" Hearing an Elf praise his work without any hint of mockery, Master Smith Varroh warmed up slightly. \"But I wouldn't call it quick. I worked on that set of Aether Gates for close to a year before the Cursed King cast the curse on us. I had almost finished when we all turned to stone.\"\"Oh, wow. I did not realize that it took that long. I thought that you had done it in the few days since you woke up.\"\"Nah, carving space stabilizing runes takes way longer than that.\" Pretending to be humble, the Dwarven Master Smith waved his hand. \"Still, if it were any other blacksmith, it would have taken them three years, Master Smith or not.\"Sprinting across the hard-packed dirt, Thorn was enjoying his fight immensely. The metal crawlers were not particularly difficult opponents, though they were sneaky. They really enjoyed trying to ambush him while he was tangled up with one of their kin. Not that he minded. The armor that Master Smith Varroh had created for him was like a second skin and provided a significant defense. As he got used to the armor set, Thorn simply allowed attacks to hit him. At first, it was a strange feeling to let the attacks roll off of him, but as he got used to it, he found himself able to fight his way through his enemies even faster than normal. Ignoring a sweeping attack, Thorn let it hit his back as his claws dug into the metal crawler in front of him. Getting a good grip, Thorn raised the huge creature over his head and smashed it down on top of the metal crawler that had just attacked him, reducing both of them to scrap.*ding*Startled by the sound, Thorn stood up straight, scanning the quarry floor. Everywhere he looked, crushed and broken metal bodies lay strewn across the dirt. The hard-packed dirt floor was covered in craters from the intensity of the fight, pieces of the metal crawlers sticking up from where Thorn had pounded them into the ground. With a silent sigh, Thorn breathed out. He felt much more relaxed. It was as if the fight had loosened a muscle that he was tensing without realizing it. Rolling his head around on his neck after pulling off his helmet, he began to walk back up to the platform from which Velin and Varroh were watching. A stream of dwarves rushed down the ramp past him with tools clutched in their hands. Once they reached the bottom of the ramp, they spread out and began harvesting the bodies of the dead metal crawlers that Thorn had left behind.\"Well done.\" Master Smith Varroh greeted Thorn as he arrived at the platform and began running experienced hands over the Titan's armor to check for damage. \"Any problems moving? It looked like there were some pauses between engagements. Was that an issue with the suit or with you?\"Gesturing with his thumb to himself, Thorn patted the helmet and then gave the Master Smith a thumbs up. The armor had performed like a dream, and if it were not for the fact that the [Living Statue] curse had taken away his ability to speak, he would have been gushing with praise. The attacks of the metal crawlers had not left a scratch on the armor set, which was still gleaming as brightly as it had been when Thorn charged into battle.After a few more minutes of checking over Thorn's armor, the Dwarven foreman who had passed Thorn heading down into the pit hurried back up the ramp and spoke in a low voice to Master Smith Varroh. Getting a nod, he presented Thorn with a small bag containing 25 gold coins and hurried down the ramp again.\"Good, I'm glad the armor is working for you. It is not nearly enough to pay you back for what you have done for my people, but it is a token of our appreciation. If you ever have any issues with it or need to get it repaired, you can come see me,\" Master Smith Varroh said gruffly as Thorn put the gold away. Reaching up to slap Thorn on the back good-naturedly, the Master Smith paused just before his hand landed on Thorn's butt. Coughing awkwardly, he threw a nod at the Titan and hurried off, leaving Thorn facing a giggling Elf.\"Alright, let's go meet up with everyone. It is time to go over our plan.\" Velin was unable to hide the smile on her face. The trip back to Moon Wolf Citadel was quick, thanks to a portal that Thorn had paid the Dwarves to erect between Nova Luna's new underground fortress, Flamespire, and the valley. It was like a permanent version of the Aether Gate that Ragnarok had used to bring more players into the fortress when the World Quest was active. After traveling through the shimmering blue arcane energy, Thorn and Velin appeared near the front gate of Moon Wolf Citadel. The guards snapped to attention at the sight of Thorn's massive form and many of the players greeted him and Velin enthusiastically.Morale among players in Nova Luna was high after the successful completion of the World Quest, and Thorn saw many new faces sporting the guild's symbol as he and Velin walked toward the fortress in the middle of the citadel. Scratching his head, Thorn looked from the gate to the fortress, which seemed to have gotten significantly further away. The distance that would have taken them a few minutes before the World Quest, now took them nearly an hour to cover. Crowds of players walked in and out of the citadel and the line of carts carrying goods in and out of the valley was way longer than Thorn remembered. Many of those new players were Wolfkin and, without exception, they stepped aside as he walked forward, staring at him with shining eyes. Slowly a silence fell as players turned their attention toward Thorn until everyone was watching him. Catching Thorn looking at the new players who were watching him with rapt attention, Velin explained.\"Someone from one of the other guilds recorded your fight against Courdum and released a video of it, complete with cool background music. It came out pretty well, though the actual impact is hard to see since they had to hide. Anyway, they called it 'The Wolf and the Stone King' and people have been going crazy over it. We have had close to a million applications in the last two days. The number of players playing as Wolfkin has jumped to nearly six million since the video came out three days ago, so the valley has gotten bigger again. Moon Wolf Citadel as well.\"I had to call your aunt, since you were out of it, but we now have an entire department that is doing nothing but trying to filter guild applications. Needless to say, after your 'meteor attack', that is what people are calling it, you have gained quite a bit of popularity. As you can see, the valley has gotten quite busy as a result. We expect some of it to die down after a bit, but the majority of these players will stay. That is one of the things we need to talk about.\"Taking one last look at the staring crowds, Thorn smiled and gave them a wave with his big hand. With a whoop, the crowd erupted into a cheer as Thorn disappeared past the imposing disciples guarding the fortress doors. Shaking his head, Thorn led the way up the large stairs, into the throne room, and through the door of his office behind the platform holding the throne. Captain Del'har met them at the door. The head of Thorn's guards looked quite dangerous in the slick black armor Thorn had gotten from Ouroboros.Almost bowing when he saw Thorn, the captain caught himself and settled for a warrior's salute, slamming his closed fist above his heart. Stepping to the side, he revealed Corvo, Oberlin, and Elder Havva sitting in chairs that had been drawn into a circle facing Thorn's desk. \"Hello, Lord Greymane.\" Elder Havva started to rise, but Thorn hurried over to stop him. \"Welcome back to the valley. You have gained quite the prestige for our people by your actions.\"Greeting the elder with a smile, Thorn unequipped his armor, changing his clothes into a fine white shirt tucked into tan, fall front trousers. An embroidered vest in dark blue peeked out from under a velvet trimmed tailcoat, and polished leather shoes covered his massive feet. His aunt and the tailor she had taken him to had teamed up to try and get him to wear a variety of fobs, but Thorn had opted for a simple gold chain he could wear across his vest and to which his guild symbol was attached. Changed, Thorn sat down in his massive chair and leaned back. \"Hey, big guy. That video was quite the sight.\" Sitting next to the elderly Wolfkin, Oberlin grinned. \"No doubt it was even crazier in person, but man, that sure was impressive. I'm glad I wasn't there.\"\"Seriously, who drops meteors on their enemies? Or eats cursed stone hearts,\" Corvo said, before he and Oberlin burst into laughter.\"Attention please.\" Velin stood and rapped on the desk for silence. \"We have a lot to cover in this meeting, so let's get started.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

Second, we need to discuss some changes that have taken place in the guild. Third, we'll be talking about the challenges that we are currently facing, as well as the proposal we've received from guild leader BurningCloud of the Eastern Alliance.\"\"Is it a marriage proposal?\" Asked Oberlin, earning himself a withering stare.\"No way.\" Corvo waved his hand dismissively. \"Thorn is only 16.\"A brief and awkward silence filled the room as Captain Del'har and Elder Havva both turned to look directly at Velin, who blushed slightly. Oblivious to this, Thorn scratched some words out on a piece of paper and held them up.[I am actually 17]\"Wait, you had a birthday? When was that?\" [When we were in the capital]\"What!? Why didn't you say something?\"Holding his hand up to quell the exclamations, Thorn wrote for a bit and then held up his paper again and gestured at his vest and tailcoat.[I don't make a big deal about my birthdays in the real world, so I didn't make a big deal about it here. My aunt bought me some clothes because it is kind of a joke between us.]\"Okay, so our lord is 17. Good news everyone, only seven more years in game until he can get married,\" Corvo said, tossing a wink at Velin. Completely ignoring him, Velin rapped on the table again.\"Let's focus, please. Some of us have a lot to do today, so we need to stay on track. As I was saying, our third topic will be the challenges Nova Luna is facing, and the proposal we have received. Fourth, we will be discussing this [Living Statue] curse that Thorn...\" Velin paused ever so slightly, causing Oberlin to snicker. \"The curse that Thorn acquired. I have a plan, but it will need some help. Are there any other topics that we need to cover?\"\"What about the crusades? Weren't we going to focus on grinding the Battlefield of Flame and Shadow so that Thorn can build up his rank?\" Oberlin asked, looking between Thorn and Velin.\"That will be part of the third topic. Anything else? No? Okay. Our first topic is getting Thorn up to speed on what has happened in the valley recently. I'll start.\" Flipping a few of the pages of her notebook over, Velin cleared her throat and straightened her posture. \"I spoke about this briefly before we arrived, but to give a general recap of the overall situation, the valley has expanded significantly due to the influx of new players and spawned natives. This is, in part, due to the video that was uploaded, but also due to the availability of the Disciple and Night Walker classes. \"A class with four possible mastery paths that are trainable is extremely enticing to players, and the class has been gaining significant popularity over the last month as players are posting about their experiences on the forums. This rise in the popularity of the class has led to an increase in the popularity of the Wolfkin race, which in turn has led to a massive influx of players.\"The valley has grown again, taking up almost the whole mountain range. I believe the mayor of Greymane Village talked to you about settling new towns, right? There are now five villages and two large towns, all bursting at the seams. You noticed that the fortress expanded as well, right? It is nearly the size of a city now and will comfortably hold a million players and natives.\"Thorn's mouth dropped open as he tried to process Velin's words. A million players was an astronomical amount, and he was having trouble processing the idea of the Citadel he had built fitting them. Noticing his shock, Corvo jumped into the conversation.\"Is this your first time experiencing mass stretching? That is what we call it when Nova Terra adjusts based on the popularity of an area. The influx of players was so significant that an adjustment had to be made, and we happened to be in the right place and time to enjoy it. New estimates for the valley put its length close to 100 miles. But that is still being confirmed as it looks like there are a ton of offshoots.\"The bigger issue is the citadel, which has grown astronomically. The front and back walls are now four miles long, and the rest of the citadel has grown with them. Our total area is now twelve square miles, give or take. I'm guessing it would have been bigger, but that whole basement area that you made when you designed the citadel has expanded to three levels, which allows for greater population density.\"\"Alright, enough about this for now.\" Velin could see Thorn's eyes glazing over, so she steered the subject in a different direction. Giving Elder Havva and Captain Del'har a smile, she gestured for them to speak. \"Let's give Elder Havva and the captain a chance to report.\"\"Thank you, Lady Velin.\" The large Wolfkin captain stood up and saluted Thorn again. \"My Lord, it is as the others report. There has been a flood of Wolfkin from all over the continent who have heard of your deeds and have returned to the valley. There is barely enough room to house them all, so we made the decision that only the members of Nova Luna and the Temple of the Moon are allowed to stay in the Citadel after the sun sets.\"Out of consideration for the merchants and crafting masters, we are selling a limited number of passes to allow temporary stays. While many have opted to stay in Greymane City instead, significant revenue has been generated by the passes. Lady Velin instructed me to use the revenue for the guard, so that is what I have been doing.\"Thorn glanced at Velin and gave the captain a thumbs up. The increased number of players and natives in the valley had undoubtedly created a need for an increased number of guards, so Thorn was happy that Velin was being proactive in that regard. [Let us know if you need a bigger budget.]\"Thank you, my Lord. What we have now should be sufficient. Licensing and fines have proven to be a better source of money than I originally thought. The only other thing I have to report is that there have been reports of giant wolves in the eastern end of the valley, close to the ruins of Greymane Keep.\"[Giant? Like how big are we talking?]\"At least as tall as me, my lord. Most of them are described as giant wolves with black fur. The reports are still being investigated, but it seems that they are quite territorial and have been chasing hunters out of the area.\"Scratching his chin, Thorn's mind immediately flashed back to the massive wolf that he had faced in the valley after he had cleared Greymane Keep. The wolf had said something about the true ruler of the valley before being driven off. If he had a chance, Thorn decided, he would go and see what was going on by the old castle. \"That is all I have to report, my Lord.\" Captain Del'har sat down again, looking toward Elder Havva, who slowly rose from his seat despite Thorn's motions.\"Good afternoon, Lord Greymane. Haha, don't worry, I am not so old that I must constantly sit.\" Smiling, the old Wolfkin patted the top of his cane. \"I am pleased to report that both the valley and the Temple of the Moon are running smoothly. Gelish has proven himself to be a good leader, and we are getting many new disciples who are joining either the Moon Guardians to guard the valley or the Night Walker Association. We have also produced our first cohort of official Night Walkers, who we have deployed as guards and mercenaries around the continent. The integration of the disciples with the guild has also been working well.\"[Thank you for your work, Elder.]\"Of course, Lord Greymane. It is my pleasure to serve.\"\"Okay, my turn.\" Corvo didn't get up from where he lounged in his chair, earning himself a dirty look from Captain Del'har. \"Ms. Silverhand agreed to help us develop the Night Walker's merchant arm, and with help from Elder Havva, we have gotten everything rolling. Turns out Ms. Silverhand really knows what she is doing. It will take a little while for the merchant group to develop fully, but we are well on our way. The other merchants we arrested have either been released or joined up.\"[What about those Wolfkin who were complaining about the moonstones?]\"Hm? Oh, Elder Havva straightened them out. There is now a pretty neat quest structure that allows you to earn moonstones by doing things for the temple. But the advantages of joining the Night Walkers is so apparent that almost everyone joins. Especially since we started the merchant arm and started giving a discount on goods. I'd guess that within a couple of months there will be close to 100% participation in either the Night Walkers or the Moon Guardians from the players who are spawning as Wolfkin.\"\"Anyone else have anything to report?\" Velin looked around the room after Corvo finished. When no one responded, she nodded and turned to the next page in her notebook. \"The next topic is specific changes in the guild. Thorn, as I mentioned, we have gotten an absurd number of applications for the guild. While a large part of them are not going to be considered, we could easily expand our guild to a few million players if we wanted to. \"Obviously, that would not be manageable, so we will be expanding the professional portion of Nova Luna to five thousand players, and the social portion of the guild to fifteen thousand players. This leaves us with 5.98 million applications. What I would like to propose is that we further strengthen the ties between the Night Walkers Association and Nova Luna. I want to develop the fifteen thousand spots in the social guild as leaders of the Night Walker Association. This way we can divert the guild applications into the Night Walkers Association without losing its loyalty.\"Leaning back, Thorn looked up at the ceiling. Truthfully, much of the organizational stuff that Velin proposed made his head spin and the scale of it was simply beyond what he could wrap his head around. When he started playing Nova Terra, he had expected to spend his time hitting things with a sword. Yet, more and more, he found himself being drawn into the swirling maelstrom of power. There was something about setting the course for other player's lives that did not sit well with him, but the more involved he got, the less he could avoid it. With a sigh, Thorn leaned forward and wrote on his paper.[That sounds fine.]\"Excellent. That will also allow us to tie ourselves into the merchant group we are developing. From now on, our new structure will be divided into four groups. Nova Luna will house our professional teams and the leadership of the merchant group, the Moon Guardians, and the Night Walker Alliance. The merchant group, which we are calling Silver Moon, for now, will be led by players from Nova Luna and will focus on developing trade for the valley. The Night Walkers will focus on providing mercenary services and protecting the Silver Moon caravans. \"Similarly, the Moon Guardians will focus on the defense and security of the valley. The Temple of the Moon will continue to recruit disciples who will be able to advance into any of the organizations. Nova Luna will recruit from the three other groups as necessary. Thorn, due to the sudden spike in applications, we have hired a significant number of support staff. Rather, your aunt, Athena, hired the staff. I would like your permission to extend their employment, creating an internal support structure for the four groups.\"[Yeah, that is a good idea. Come up with a budget and I'll take a look at it.]\"I will. Now, on to the third topic.\" Making a note, Velin flipped to the next page and cleared her throat. \"Currently, apart from our management issues, we are facing two problems. First is Thorn's trial. We still have three weeks until he has to be in the capital city, but with his cursed state, he will not be able to mount his own defense. I do not feel comfortable leaving his defense to others, so we need to do something about this curse.\"The second problem we are facing is the fact that our fearless leader swallowed a cursed heart and can no longer speak. I mention this as a separate problem because we are about to have an astronomical number of new players joining our various organizations, largely because of Thorn, and they will want to have some sort of interaction with him.\"\"We could take a picture of him giving a thumbs up.\" Corvo winked at Thorn.\"Whatever we do, it needs to be sooner rather than later.\" Velin glanced around the room.[How about we send out a personalized letter? Welcoming people to the guild?]\"You mean, when they sign up?\"[Yeah, and maybe inviting them to a party in two months. Then we can throw a big celebration in the valley. Your plan will not take more than two months, right?]\"Hm. That could work. It would give everyone something to work toward, providing cohesion. Let's try that.\"[If we want something to provide cohesion, how about this? I want to open a bounty on Ragnarok. Five gold per verified kill, a bigger reward if their caravans are knocked over. I'll pay for anything that disrupts their operations.]\"Whoa, are you serious?\" Oberlin sat up straight after reading Thorn's words.[I'm tired of getting pushed around, so it is time they felt a bit of our weight.]The thin thief grinned and rubbed his hands together.\"You sure you can afford this?\"\"An open bounty on Ragnarok actually fits in with the next topic. BurningCloud has asked us to join Eastern Alliance and a few other guilds in declaring formal war against Ragnarok. I was going to suggest that we avoid a formal war, so this would fit the request nicely. If you are okay with it, I'll negotiate with BurningCloud to get a standard bounty structure established. BurningCloud also asked for a formal alliance, but the details of that are still being worked up. My guess is that she wants to use the alliance as a way to pull us into her guild.\"[Probably. Isn't that how the Eastern Alliance formed?]\"Yes. They began as a collection of guilds that wanted to stand up against Ragnarok. \"[You can tell her we're interested in a loose alliance, but nothing too binding.]\"That sounds appropriate.\" Making another note, Velin nodded and flipped to the next page of her notebook. \"Alright. That brings us to the final topic. Helping Thorn get rid of the [Living Statue] curse.\"-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

Curious, everyone but Corvo leaned forward to examine it. The golden liquid rolled around like quicksilver in the vial as she moved it back and forth.\"This is the sap of the World Tree.\" Pausing for a moment to allow her words to sink in, Velin gave a small smile and placed the vial on Thorn's desk before she continued. \"Known primarily for its healing properties, the sap also has strong purifying abilities. Unfortunately, there is not enough of it here to deal with the [Living Statue] curse. But if we can find the World Tree itself, we should be able to get enough.\"Watching the golden liquid curiously, Thorn brought up its item description. \"Sheesh. Doesn't that mean that Thorn is going to have to take a bath in the stuff?\" Oberlin asked, looking back and forth between the vial and Thorn's massive body.\"Actually, yes.\" Velin nodded, her face serious. \"That means that our only hope is finding the World Tree.\"\"And how are we going to do that? No one has any idea where the World Tree is located.\"\"Not true.\" A brief smile flashed across Velin's face as she shared a quest. \"This is a quest I've had for quite a while, and I've been slowly narrowing down possible locations of the World Tree. A couple weeks ago, I finally narrowed it down to the island of Rasyn.\"\"Isn't that the Elven island off the eastern coast?\"\"Yes. From the myths I have traced, that is where Elves first appeared. I was able to piece an incredible legend together from multiple sources, and if it is true, or even just grounded in truth, we'll find the World Tree on Rasyn.\"[What is the legend?]\"Whoa, can we talk about the fact that you have a quad category class quest?\" Corvo asked, interrupting Velin who was about to start expounding on the legend for Thorn. \"[World Tree's Holy Emissary] sounds like a pretty serious class. Where on earth did you find that?\"\"The vial of sap is an ancient inheritance. I got it shortly after I started playing, but I did not figure out what it was until about a year ago, which is when I started working on unraveling the legends seriously.\"\"Wow. Just wow.\" The avatar of Huginn buried his head in his hands. \"You people are ridiculous. Things like quad category classes are supposed to be super rare, and they just fall out of the sky around here like nothing.\" Raising his head he looked around scornfully until his gaze fell on Oberlin, who was looking away. Corvo's eyes shot wide and he jumped to his feet, his finger pointing at the thin thief. \"What?! Don't you dare say that you have one, too!\"\"Hmm? Me? What are you talking about?\" Oberlin's eyes shifted guiltily. \"I... I don't think I can be friends with you people any more.\" With a huff, Corvo sat down on his chair again.[Listen, birdman, you don't have any right to complain.]Thorn wrote out, wagging his finger at the sulking avatar. Writing another note, he passed it to Velin.[What were you going to say before you were interrupted?]\"According to what I've pieced together, there was a time when Angoril was a single massive continent. The legend actually describes it as an island for some reason, but that might be an issue with translation. Regardless, there was some sort of massive war that brought the land to almost complete ruin. Only an area called the Garden of the Immortal was left untouched by the ravages of the war. However, the invading forces began to push the people of Angoril back toward the garden. Just as all hope seemed lost, the immortal who lived in the garden came forward and destroyed the invaders with a single strike.\"However, the slap was so strong that Angoril was split in half. Only the power of an Elven Archmage protected the garden by raising a mountain range in the path of the destructive force. The mountain succeeded in diverting the force, but it caused the garden to split off from the rest of the continent, becoming Rasyn. According to the information I traded from Karrandras, the World Tree is located in the ruins of the Garden of the Immortal.\"\"Can you really trust the words of a devil?\" Oberlin shivered slightly as he remembered the hulking form of the greater devil that Ouroboros had assumed after giving in to Karrandras' corruption. \"It seems like trusting a devil of betrayal is not a good call.\"\"We cannot put absolute faith in what he said, but he has to follow some basic rules, and based on what I traded to him, he had to be telling some truth. Plus, he probably did not expect that I would have run across the name 'Garden of the Immortal' before. It is a name that is quite uncommon, even among scholars. If it wasn't for the World Quest and finding the labyrinth city, Rakkam, I never would have been able to pinpoint its location.\"[How did finding Rakkam help?]\"It was Baxby who was able to translate the runes on the Dwarven Earth Map, which helped me translate a few references to the Tree of Life that I had from some ancient Dwarven texts. The Dwarves call the World Tree the Tree of Life.\"[So the plan is to go to Rasyn, find the World Tree, and take a bath?]\"In its most basic form, yes,\" Velin nodded.\"Aren't we ignoring a major problem though?\" Oberlin scratched his nose. \"Rasyn is a three week journey from here, at the very least. Thorn has to be in the capital for his hearing in three weeks. How will you get to the Island, find the World Tree, and get back in time for the hearing?\"\"That is where I am hoping that Corvo can help. I asked him to connect with one of his contacts, who will hopefully be able to help us speed up our trip.\" Velin glanced at the lounging Elf. \"If that doesn't work, our only chance is to rush to the capital as fast as possible and use one of the Aether gates to travel to the island.\"[The capital has Aether Gates? Why don't we set up one between here and the capital? Then we can go any time we want. That would be way more convenient than running.]After waiting a moment while Thorn wrote out his question, Corvo chuckled and stood up. \"Aether Gates cost a fortune. So far, only regional capitals have them. The main issue is that the material needed to make them is in short supply. Most of the top guilds have temporary ones that use mana, but to make a stable gate you have to take the material from an existing gate. So if we want an Aether Gate, we will need to become the capital of the Ironhold Duchy, or find an abandoned gate that we can swipe.\"[Can we repurpose the one that the Dwarves set up for us between here and Firespire?]\"That may be possible, but it is unlikely,\" Velin spoke up, flipping to a new page in her notebook and beginning to jot something down. \"The runes needed to bind the gate to a specific location are beyond what our crafters can manage. In fact, I would be surprised if there are any players who are able to craft it. Only a Master Smith like Varroh would be able to create the runeset we need, and according to him, it would take at least a year to do.\"[Hmm. Better work on becoming a duke, huh? Haha.]\"Hey, don't joke about that.\" Corvo shook his head after reading Thorn's paper. \"Treason is a big deal, remember?\"\"[Candle Flame].\" Muttering a few syllables, Velin pointed her finger and a small flame floated out and landed on Thorn's paper, burning it until nothing remained but ash. \"Corvo is right. You can think it, but don't say it. We don't want to add to the nobles' reasons to get rid of you.\"[Point taken. I'll keep it in mind.]Thorn nodded seriously and then kept writing. [So, how is Corvo going to help us get to Rasyn quickly?]\"Birds.\" Chuckling at the blank stares he was getting, Corvo gestured for everyone to follow him and led the way out of the office and into the throne room. Bringing the group to the balcony, he pointed out at the valley.It took a moment for Thorn to see what he was pointing at, but after scanning the floor of the valley, a flash of movement caught his eye and he looked up. Wheeling over the valley was a black dot that was rapidly growing bigger. Soon the dot became a large bird, the largest bird that Thorn had ever seen. With a body almost ten feet long, and wings that were nearly twenty feet from tip to tip, the massive bird approached the citadel like a bolt of lightning, crossing the length of the valley in only a few seconds.Wickedly sharp talons spread open as the bird flapped its wings, landing neatly on the edge of the balcony. A small hand appeared on the leather harness around its chest and the tiny figure of a halfling slid around the bird's neck and hopped nimbly down onto the railing. A fearsome beak dipped toward the small lady, coming to gently rest on her shoulder.Caressing the bird's head, the tiny woman murmured some words under her breath and then patted its beak. Lifting its head, the bird gave an imperious cry, looking arrogantly at the people arrayed on the fortress' balcony. Feeling the bird's sharp gaze landing on him, Oberlin had to stifle the urge to retreat, and even Captain Del'har found his hand drifting to the handle of his sword. Making a disdainful chirping sound, the bird continued running its eyes over the group until it got to Thorn. Curious about the big bird, Thorn met its sharp gaze, only to see it quail backward, ducking its head behind the small lady's back. The bird's arrogant chirps were suddenly much more reserved, and it tried its best to keep its head out of Thorn's sight. Confused, the short lady tried to turn around, but the enormous bird kept its head behind her back. Finally, she gave two short chirps and a whistle, and the bird let out a relieved cry. Spreading its wings, it launched itself from the balcony, flying up over the valley where it began to turn lazy circles.Shooting a sharp look at Thorn, the short woman stood on the balcony's railing, her head barely coming up past the Titan's thigh. She wore patchwork leather armor with random metal plates scattered across it, seemingly held together by thick belts with heavy buckles. Sharp features were visible under a shock of bright blue hair, and as she turned her head Thorn could see that half of her head was shaved. A variety of trinkets hung from her outfit, creating the sound of wind chimes whenever she moved, and there seemed to be a breeze always blowing around her, causing her short cape to stir. Bowing toward Thorn with her handheld in front of her face, she raised her head and looked him up and down.\"Peregrine, at your service.\"Smiling and nodding in greeting, Thorn glanced down at Corvo. Catching the glance, Corvo stepped forward smoothly to provide a proper introduction.\"Thorn, this is Peregrine, the Storm Eagle. Avatar of Tyra, god of the Sky. Peregrine, this is Thorn, eater of things and the avatar of Hati, the Moon Wolf. Unfortunately, the last thing he ate seems to have gotten stuck in his throat so we're calling him 'the great mute one,' but I'm happy to speak on his behalf.\" Corvo gave a wide grin and winked at Peregrine, who just snorted.\"Hah, no one who knows you would dare let you speak for them.\" Scanning the rest of the group, Peregrine tucked her thumbs in the thick belts crisscrossing her armor as her gaze settled on Velin. \"You must be Velin. I was told by bird brain over there that you need some help moving some stuff. If you do, and you have the coin,\" Peregrine jerked a thumb toward her chest, \"then I'm your gal.\"\"We have plenty of coin, but I'm not sure that your bird is going to be big enough.\"\"Roko is an Imperial Roc. Not a bird. And what do you mean by not big enough?\" Looking over her shoulder at the giant Roc flying above the valley, Peregrine cocked her head to the side, revealing its shaved side. \"Roko can carry six hundred pounds easily. What do you have to move that weighs more than that.\"\"Ehm. About that.\" Corvo coughed into his hand as he looked at Thorn from the corner of his eyes.Following the other avatar's gaze, Peregrine's eyes landed on Thorn's huge figure, causing him to look away sheepishly. Thorn rubbed the back of his head. It really was not his fault that he was so big.\"You want to transport him? Are you crazy? He looks like he'd crush anything he sits on. Wow. He weighs, what, close to a ton?\"\"Eh, maybe a bit more?\" Corvo scratched his head and shrugged. \"Thankfully, the game seems to compensate for it so he doesn't just crush everything. We're hoping that the same thing will happen when he sits on your bird.\"\"I told you, Roko is an Imperial Roc. But based on their latest interaction, I don't know that it's a good idea to put him on her back.\"\"Well, this is a problem, isn't it?\"\"Hey, it is not my problem, it is your problem.\" Peregrine waved her hands, grinning at Corvo. \"I showed up like I told you I would. It is not my fault that I can't help you.\" Giving a piercing whistle, she had just turned away when a familiar sound made her foot pause in mid-air.*ding* -----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!

She scanned over Thorn's massive figure, and then she reread the notification floating in front of her eyes.\"How is this fair?\" Despite her complaining tone, Peregrine's eyes were steady, and she kept her hand on the short knife sheathed across the small of her back. \"Why does it have to be a fight? Can't we settle this peacefully?\"\"Hahahaha.\" Corvo burst into laughter at the sight of Peregrine getting ready to face off against Thorn. \"You got a challenge, didn't you? Haha, sorry, sorry. It's not funny, I know. Haha.\"\"You knew this would happen, didn't you? You knew exactly what was going to happen when you invited me here.\" Still keeping her eyes fixed on Thorn, who had not moved, Peregrine spoke to the avatar of Huginn.[A fight hardly seems fair, does it?] Unsure if Hati would be able to hear his thoughts, Thorn still tried his best to project them. [What does fairness have to do with determining dominance?] Sure enough, Hati's warm tones sounded in his head, though the content of the question threw Thorn off.[Um...] Actually, what did fairness have to do with the challenges? As Thorn was pondering over this question, another voice he had never heard before sounded in his head.[It only counts if it is fair. I will not accept this contest, you mangy dog.] This new voice was majestic and sharp, leaving Thorn stinging, as though he had just been cut. The words in the avatar challenge that had popped up wiggled and morphed under his eyes. [Do not try my patience, Tyra.] Hati's voice rumbled like thunder around Thorn's head, the god of night's displeasure nearly sending him to the ground.[You are the one who wanted your avatar to beat up mine.] Tyra's majestic voice had lost some of its grandeur, taking on a slightly petulant edge. It reminded Thorn of Mina when she was pouting. After a brief moment of silence, Hati sighed, the anger in his voice gone.[Fine, have it your way. Thorn, I am looking forward to seeing how you handle this.]Still weaving slightly from the impact of Hati's annoyance, Thorn took a second to stabilize himself and then read over the updated quest. Across from him, Peregrine's eyes lit up and she hopped down from the balcony's railing. A wide grin spread across her face as she took in Thorn's massive body again. The avatar challenge had just gone from wildly in Thorn's favor to his complete disadvantage. Despite being unable to hear Hati and Tyra's voices, Corvo was instantly able to tell that something had changed. Raising one eyebrow, he looked between Thorn and Peregrine curiously. When the Titan did not say anything, Corvo sighed and gestured toward the throne room.\"We better go sit down, I am guessing that this is going to take some figuring out.\"A few minutes later, seated in the office behind the throne room once again, Corvo looked between Thorn and Peregrine.\"So spill it. You have to announce the challenge anyway, so let's hear it.\"Shrugging and pointing to his mouth, Thorn gestured for Peregrine to share what was going on with the others. Bouncing to her feet and standing on the chair, the halfling smiled broadly and explained.\"In this challenge, the Lord Baron here has to successfully befriend one of Tyra's subjects. That includes any sort of flying creature, from gnats to griffins. The only catch is that the creature he becomes buds with must be able to carry him.\"\"That is his part of the challenge. What is yours?\" Velin lifted her eyes from the note she was writing to look at the grinning halfling.\"Mine, oh, I just have to help him. I must give him full cooperation and get him in front of the wonderful creature he'll be making friends with. I'm responsible for making sure that his new potential friend arrives in a timely fashion. If I can't do that, he wins. If he can't make friends, then I win.\"\"What do you mean by creature? Why the singular?\"\"Ah, yeah. About that. There is really only one creature under Tyra's rule that I know of that will be able to carry someone of his... uh, stature.\" Peregrine tried to measure Thorn's width with her hands. \"I mentioned that Roko is an Imperial Roc, right? Well, she is also just a chick. If we want to get the baron airborne, we're going to need to visit her big brother. You saw how big Roko is, right? Well, her brother is at least four times the size.\"Frowning, Thorn pulled over a piece of paper and began to write while everyone else stared at him. After a few minutes he flipped the paper around and handed it to Corvo, who was sitting in the closest chair.\"Ehem. The great mute one, haha, I mean Lord Greymane, would like to know the following.\" Clearing his throat again, Corvo read off the list of questions. \"First, where does Roko's brother live, and is it close by? Second, how is he supposed to communicate with the Roc? Third, why can't we look for a griffin or a dragon, or something like that?\"\"All fair questions.\" Smiling at Thorn, Peregrine held up her small hand and counted the questions on her fingers. \"First, Roko's brother is the Emperor of the Sky. He lives above the clouds, so it can't really be counted as close by. However, that will not be an issue as we can meet him on the tallest mountain peak nearby. Rocs fly faster than you can imagine, so it will not take long for Roko to find him and bring him over. Second, you communicate with a Roc very carefully.\"The Emperor of the Sky is the absolute ruler of his domain, so it might take some convincing for him to agree to talk to you. But he is really smart as well, so if he wants to talk to you, it shouldn't be an issue. Third, griffins are smaller than Imperial Rocs. Most of them don't get beyond ten feet long, so you wouldn't be able to ride on them. As for dragons, if they actually existed, you'd have to be certifiably insane to think about riding one.\"Confused, Thorn looked over at Corvo, who nodded in agreement with Peregrine's words.\"Dragons are totally evil. At least, the records that we have describe them as the epitome of different vices. No players that I know of have encountered dragons in the game so far, but chances are that, if they reappear, it will not be a friendly encounter.\"\"Quite interesting, but let's refocus, please. We are under significant time constraints and have no time to lose.\" Velin steered the conversation back toward the main topic. Tucking a strand of hair behind her ear, she fixed her gaze on Peregrine. \"How quickly can you ask the Emperor of the Sky to come?\"\"Uh, I'd guess that if I sent Roko out now it would take, hmmm. Maybe six hours? Seven? Something like that. At top speed, she can cross Angoril within five hours. That is assuming she has no rider, of course.\"\"Excellent. Thorn, I would like to propose the following schedule.\" Standing, Velin flipped open her notebook and placed it on the desk in front of Thorn for him to look over. \"There are two major things that need to be addressed before we leave. First, we need to decide on the team that is going to be going, but that has to wait until we know what sort of travel capacity our ride has. It is also dependent on you succeeding with this challenge.\"Obviously, if you fail, then we will need to reconsider our plan. Second, we need to make sure that everything in the valley is properly arranged before we leave. This will include assigning responsibilities, making sure we have a proper chain of communication, and so on. I can handle a lot of this, but I will need a couple of hours of your time to sign off on what we've established.\"Nodding in agreement, Thorn's brow furrowed, and he pulled out a fresh sheet of paper.[I'm also a bit worried about these large wolves that are being reported on the edge of the valley. This isn't the first time we've heard reports about them.]\"Hmm. That has the potential to be a major time sink, but we could probably squeeze in a preliminary investigation.\"[How about I go take a quick look. I have to find Akira anyway, and from what I can sense, she is out that direction.]\"You know you can summon her, right?\" Corvo asked, looking at Thorn strangely.[True, but she might be with her family, so I would feel really awkward forcing her to come over here.]\"Hey, she is your pet. So you do what you want. Also, this waiting around for you to write is making the conversation drag. You should learn sign language or something.\"Perking up, Thorn had the impulse to smack himself on the forehead. Sign language would be a perfect solution to his lack of speech. While it would require the people around him to learn some basic signs as well, he was pretty sure that they could quickly establish at least basic communication. Looking at Velin, he pointed to Corvo and gave a thumbs up.\"That is a good idea. I will add that to the list.\" Taking back her notebook, Velin wrote for a couple minutes. \"Alright. We have four things to do. First, we'll go over the plan for managing the valley while we are gone. Second, I will look up some basic signing while you, third, go and find Akira. While you are getting Akira, you'll check out the large wolves. Fourth, once you've completed the challenge, we'll establish who is coming with us to Rasyn. Sound good?\"At the nods from the others in the room, Velin turned and bowed slightly to Peregrine, who was still standing on the chair, listening with interest. \"Please call the Emperor of the Sky first thing tomorrow morning. That way, Thorn has the morning to find Akira and deal with the wolves. You are welcome to stay in one of the rooms here at the fortress. Do you need anything for Roko? Food or a space to rest, perhaps?\"\"Thanks, but I'm good. Roko gets really nervous around lots of people, so it is probably safer if I try to find a place up on the mountain. I'll be back tomorrow, along with the Emperor.\" Jumping neatly from her chair to the windowsill, the halfling gave out a piercing whistle before looking over her shoulder at Thorn. \"I'm looking forward to seeing how you handle this, Lord Baron. It should be quite an exciting encounter.\"As she finished speaking, she leaped out the window, landing neatly on the back of the Imperial Roc that flashed by. Giving the people in the office one last wave, she tightened her grip on the harness Roko was wearing. With a chirp, the Imperial Roc accelerated suddenly, disappearing into the clouds surrounding the Twins within a moment.\"What a showoff.\" Corvo strode to the window to look out at the mountain peak. Turning around, he found everyone in the room staring at him disdainfully. About to ask what was wrong, he froze when Thorn pointed to him. Making a poofing motion with his hands, the Titan began to flap his hands like little wings and pretend to fly around the room.\"Haha, exactly.\" Oberlin, who had been listening quietly this whole time erupted into laughter at the sight of Thorn's antics. \"Yeah, yeah. Alright, I get it. That is really disturbing, so can you stop?\" Corvo held up his hands in defeat as he watched the Titan pretend to fly around the room. \"Velin, do you need anything from me before tomorrow? If not, I've got some work to do.\"\"No, we are done here. Thorn, you have until noon tomorrow to get Akira. Please try to be back around ten rather than twelve, as we don't want to keep the Emperor of the Sky waiting. It sounds like it will be a challenging encounter, so it is probably better that we don't start on the wrong foot.\"His face becoming serious, Thorn nodded. If the initial attitude of Roko, the young Imperial Roc, was anything to go by then he would be facing a really tough situation. Her attitude had been one of absolute superiority, and it was obvious that her arrogance came from deep within her bones. Such an attitude was not conducive to making friends. If Thorn wanted to become friends with a fully grown Imperial Roc in a short time, he was going to have to come up with some way to get past the creature's innate arrogance.Mulling over the problem, Thorn listened to Velin's last few notes and then set off to find Akira. The sun was just beginning to set, creating beautiful layers of deep blues and pinks that spread across the horizon. Nodding to the saluting guards as he walked out of the fortress, Thorn was surprised to see that the crowds had not lessened in the least. Instead, the mass of players had gotten denser. For a moment, Thorn was not sure how he was going to get through the crowd, but then a few of the players in front of him saw his massive figure and instinctively fell back. Like a wave, the crowd began to part as Thorn walked forward, many of the players pointing and whispering. Trying not to grimace, he hurried out of the citadel's back gate, heading into the valley. As soon as he entered the valley, he broke into a run, his space-eating strides carrying him through the forest.Focusing on the subtle connection that he shared with Akira, Thorn ran across the valley floor. This was the first time he had been back in Fang Valley since he had established Moon Wolf Citadel at the valley's entrance. Marveling at the way the game had expanded it, Thorn picked up his speed, his footfalls causing the ground to vibrate as he ran.-----------------------------------------------**Author's Note**Hi everyone!
